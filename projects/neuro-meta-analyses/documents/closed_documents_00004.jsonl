In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine brain network dysfunction in MCI and AD. We systematically searched task-based fMRI studies in MCI and AD published between January 1990 and January 2014. Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses were conducted to compare the significant group differences in brain activation, the significant voxels were overlaid onto seven referenced neuronal cortical networks derived from the resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 healthy participants. Thirty-nine task-based fMRI studies (697 MCI patients and 628 healthy controls) were included in MCI-related meta-analysis while 36 task-based fMRI studies (421 AD patients and 512 healthy controls) were included in AD-related meta-analysis. The meta-analytic results revealed that MCI and AD showed abnormal regional brain activation as well as large-scale brain networks. MCI patients showed hypoactivation in default, frontoparietal, and visual networks relative to healthy controls, whereas AD-related hypoactivation mainly located in visual, default, and ventral attention networks relative to healthy controls. Both MCI-related and AD-related hyperactivation fell in frontoparietal, ventral attention, default, and somatomotor networks relative to healthy controls. MCI and AD presented different pathological while shared similar compensatory large-scale networks in fulfilling the cognitive tasks. These system-level findings are helpful to link the fundamental declines of cognitive tasks to brain networks in MCI and AD.

The present work provides the first meta-analysis of this growing literature to delineate brain substrates of conditioned fear-generalization and formulate a working neural model. Included studies (K = 6, N = 176) reported whole-brain fMRI results and applied generalization-gradient methodology to identify brain activations that gradually strengthen (positive generalization) or weaken (negative generalization) as presented stimuli increase in CS+ resemblance. Positive generalization was instantiated in cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, striatal-thalamic, and midbrain regions (locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey, ventral tegmental area), while negative generalization was implemented in default-mode network nodes (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus) and amygdala. Findings are integrated within an updated neural account of generalization centering on the hippocampus, its modulation by locus coeruleus and basolateral amygdala, and the excitation of threat- or safety-related loci by the hippocampus.

Neuroimaging studies have reported functional and grey matter abnormalities, but not all the studies have reported consistent findings. Identifying convergent abnormalities across COFPs provides a basis for future hypothesis-driven research aimed at elucidating common CNS mechanisms. Here, we perform three coordinate-based meta-analyses according to PRISMA guidelines to elucidate the central mechanisms of orofacial pain disorders. Specifically, we investigated consistent patterns of: (1) brain function to experimental orofacial pain in healthy subjects, (2) structural and (3) functional brain abnormalities in COFP. We computed our coordinate-based meta-analyses using GingerALE. The experimental pain meta-analysis revealed increased brain activity in bilateral thalami, posterior mid-cingulate cortices, and secondary somatosensory cortices, the right posterior parietal cortex extending to the orofacial region of the right primary somatosensory cortex and the right insula, and decreased activity in the right somatomotor regions. The structural COFP meta-analysis identified consistent higher grey matter volume/concentration in the right ventral thalamus and posterior putamen of COFP patients compared to healthy controls. The functional COFP meta-analysis identified a consistent increase in brain activity in the left medial and posterior thalamus and lesser activity in the left posterior insula in COFP, compared to healthy controls. Overall, these findings provide evidence of brain abnormalities in pain-related regions, namely the thalamus and insula, across different COFP disorders. The convergence of thalamic abnormalities in both structure and function suggest a key role for this region in COFP pathophysiology.

This comparative multimodal meta-analysis assessed shared and disorder-specific neuroanatomy and neurofunction of inhibitory functions. A comparative meta-analysis of 62 voxel-based morphometry and 26 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of inhibitory control was conducted comparing gray matter volume and activation abnormalities between patients with ASD (structural MRI: 911; fMRI: 188) and OCD (structural MRI: 928; fMRI: 247) and control subjects. Multimodal meta-analysis compared groups across voxel-based morphometry and fMRI. Both disorders shared reduced function and structure in the rostral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate. OCD patients had a disorder-specific increase in structure and function of left basal ganglia (BG) and insula relative to control subjects and ASD patients, who had reduced right BG and insula volumes versus OCD patients. In fMRI, ASD patients showed disorder-specific reduced left dorsolateral-prefrontal activation and reduced posterior cingulate deactivation, whereas OCD patients showed temporoparietal underactivation. The multimodal comparative meta-analysis shows shared and disorder-specific abnormalities. Whereas the rostrodorsomedial prefrontal cortex was smaller in structure and function in both disorders, this was concomitant with increased structure and function in BG and insula in OCD patients, but a reduction in ASD patients, presumably reflecting a disorder-specific frontostriatoinsular dysregulation in OCD in the form of poor frontal control over overactive BG, and a frontostriatoinsular maldevelopment in ASD with reduced structure and function in this network. Disorder-differential mechanisms appear to drive overlapping phenotypes of inhibitory control abnormalities in patients with ASD and OCD.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have probed the neural basis of this emotional enhancement effect on encoding processes, while relatively fewer studies have examined retrieval. Neuroimaging meta-analysis methods can summarize the brain regions associated with emotional episodic memory that are consistently activated across multiple studies. A previous ALE (Activation Likelihood Estimation) meta-analysis identified consistent activations associated with successful encoding of episodic emotional memory in the amygdala, hippocampus, and in multiple neocortical regions (Murty et al., 2010). However, since that study, meta-analysis methods have improved, and many new relevant neuroimaging studies have been published. Moreover, although qualitative reviews have summarized brain activations related to the successful retrieval of emotional episodic memory, no corresponding quantitative meta-analyses have yet been reported. Here we conducted neuroimaging meta-analyses of successful emotional memory encoding and rretrieval using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Relevant neuroimaging studies reporting whole-brain fMRI correlates of successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory were selected for analysis. For successful emotional memory encoding, SDM activations were found bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), bilaterally in visual processing regions (middle temporal, gyrus, fusiform gyrus and occipital cortex) and bilaterally in the temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, putamen, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri. In contrast to the prior meta-analysis, SDM activations were not observed in the inferior frontal gyrus or in parietal regions. For successful emotional episodic memory retrieval, SDM activations were observed in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, and left entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex and right middle temporal gyrus), prefrontal cortex (bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right frontal pole) and other regions in the left hemisphere including the temporal pole, insula, putamen, angular gyrus, and parietal opercular cortex. Considerable overlap was observed between the encoding and retrieval meta-analysis maps in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex, right middle temporal gyrus), and other regions including the left orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, left putamen, left pallidum, and left temporal pole. The current findings add to current understanding of the role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions in the successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory, clarify and provide an important summary of the current literature in this area, and have implications for current theories of emotional episodic memory encoding and retrieval.

This study reviewed 61 candidate articles and finally selected 10 qualified voxel-wise whole-brain analysis studies for performing a comprehensive series of meta-analyses employing effect size signed differential mapping approach. Compared with healthy controls, subjects with IGD showed a significant activation in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and the left cingulate gyrus, as well as the left medial temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, the on-line time of IGD subjects was positively correlated with activations in the left MFG and the right cingulated gyrus.

Here we are the first to review and discuss four Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of fMRI studies using subliminal paradigms. We find a maximum of 9 out of 12 studies using subliminal presentation of faces contributing to activation of the amygdala, and also a significantly high number of studies reporting activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate, bilateral insular cortex, hippocampus and primary visual cortex. Subliminal faces are the strongest modality, whereas lexical stimuli are the weakest. Meta-analyses independent of studies using Regions of Interest (ROI) revealed no biasing effect. Core neuronal arousal in the brain, which may be at first independent of conscious processing, potentially involves a network incorporating primary visual areas, somatosensory, implicit memory and conflict monitoring regions. These data could provide candidate brain regions for the study of psychiatric disorders associated with aberrant automatic emotional processing.

However, it remains unclear whether cultural differences in multiple psychological processes correspond to the same or different neural networks. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 35 functional MRI studies to examine cultural differences in brain activity engaged in social and non-social processes. We showed that social cognitive processes are characterized by stronger activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral frontal cortex and temporoparietal junction in East Asians but stronger activity in the anterior cingulate, ventral medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula in Westerners. Social affective processes are associated with stronger activity in the right dorsal lateral frontal cortex in East Asians but greater activity in the left insula and right temporal pole in Westerners. Non-social processes induce stronger activity in the left inferior parietal cortex, left middle occipital and left superior parietal cortex in East Asians but greater activations in the right lingual gyrus, right inferior parietal cortex and precuneus in Westerners. The results suggest that cultural differences in social and non-social processes are mediated by distinct neural networks.

Studies that reported peak activations in standard space contrasting figurative vs. literal language processing at whole brain level in healthy adults were included. The left and right IFG, large parts of the left temporal lobe, the bilateral medial frontal gyri (medFG) and an area around the left amygdala emerged for figurative language processing across studies. Conditions requiring exclusively literal language processing did not activate any selective regions in most of the cases, but if so they activated the cuneus/precuneus, right MFG and the right IPL. No general RH advantage for metaphor processing could be found. On the contrary, significant clusters of activation for metaphor conditions were mostly lateralized to the left hemisphere (LH). Subgroup comparisons between experiments on metaphors, idioms, and irony/sarcasm revealed shared activations in left frontotemporal regions for idiom and metaphor processing. Irony/sarcasm processing was correlated with activations in midline structures such as the medFG, ACC and cuneus/precuneus. To test the graded salience hypothesis (GSH, Giora, 1997), novel metaphors were contrasted against conventional metaphors. In line with the GSH, RH involvement was found for novel metaphors only. Here we show that more analytic, semantic processes are involved in metaphor comprehension, whereas irony/sarcasm comprehension involves theory of mind processes.

Moreover, few studies have addressed the neural networks for negative word processing in bilinguals. To fill this gap, the current study examined the brain networks for processing negative words in the first language (L1) and the second language (L2) with Chinese-English bilinguals. To identify objective indicators associated with negative word processing, we first conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis on contrasts between negative and neutral words (including 32 contrasts from 1589 participants) using the activation likelihood estimation method. Results showed that the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the left amygdala, the left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and the left thalamus were involved in processing negative words. Next, these six clusters were used as regions of interest in effective connectivity analyses using extended unified structural equation modeling to pinpoint the brain networks for bilingual negative word processing. Brain network results revealed two pathways for negative word processing in L1: a dorsal pathway consisting of the left IFG, the left mPFC, and the left PCC, and a ventral pathway involving the left amygdala, the left ITG, and the left thalamus. We further investigated the similarity and difference between brain networks for negative word processing in L1 and L2. The findings revealed similarities in the dorsal pathway, as well as differences primarily in the ventral pathway, indicating both neural assimilation and accommodation across processing negative emotion in two languages of bilinguals.

Meta-regressions were employed to investigate possible moderators. Patients with OCD, compared with healthy control subjects, showed increased activation in the bilateral amygdala, right putamen, orbitofrontal cortex extending into the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and middle temporal and left inferior occipital cortices during emotional processing. Right amygdala hyperactivation was most pronounced in unmedicated patients. Symptom severity was related to increased activation in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and precuneus. Greater comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders was associated with higher activation in the right amygdala, putamen, and insula as well as with lower activation in the left amygdala and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Patients with OCD show increased emotional processing-related activation in limbic, frontal, and temporal regions. Previous mixed evidence regarding the role of the amygdala in OCD has likely been influenced by patient characteristics (such as medication status) and low statistical power.

To test this hypothesis, we scoured academic databases for neuroimaging studies involving learning under uncertainty, and performed a meta-analysis of brain activation maps that compared learning in the face of social versus nonsocial uncertainty. Although most of the brain activations associated with learning error signals were shared between social and nonsocial conditions, we found some evidence for functional segregation of error signals of exclusively social origin during learning in limited regions of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and insula. This suggests that most behavioral adaptations to navigate social environments are reused from frontal and subcortical areas processing generic value representation and learning, but that a specialized circuitry might have evolved in prefrontal regions to deal with social context representation and strategic action.

Despite its widespread application in human and animal studies, the neurobiological basis of fear conditioning remains only partially understood.

As a distinguishing feature of this meta-analysis, original statistical brain maps were obtained from the authors of 13 of these studies. Our primary analyses demonstrate that human fear conditioning is associated with a consistent and robust pattern of neural activation across a hypothesized genuine network of brain regions resembling existing anatomical descriptions of the 'central autonomic-interoceptive network'. This finding is discussed with a particular emphasis on the neural substrates of conscious fear processing. Our associated meta-analysis of functional deactivations-a scarcely addressed dynamic in fMRI fear-conditioning studies-also suggests the existence of a coordinated brain response potentially underlying the 'safety signal' (that is, non-threat) processing. We attempt to provide an integrated summary on these findings with the view that they may inform ongoing studies of fear-conditioning processes both in healthy and clinical populations, as investigated with neuroimaging and other experimental approaches.

ALE assesses the overlap between foci based on modeling them as probability distributions centered at the respective coordinates. In this Human Brain Project/Neuroinformatics research, the authors present a revised ALE algorithm addressing drawbacks associated with former implementations. The first change pertains to the size of the probability distributions, which had to be specified by the used. To provide a more principled solution, the authors analyzed fMRI data of 21 subjects, each normalized into MNI space using nine different approaches. This analysis provided quantitative estimates of between-subject and between-template variability for 16 functionally defined regions, which were then used to explicitly model the spatial uncertainty associated with each reported coordinate. Secondly, instead of testing for an above-chance clustering between foci, the revised algorithm assesses above-chance clustering between experiments. The spatial relationship between foci in a given experiment is now assumed to be fixed and ALE results are assessed against a null-distribution of random spatial association between experiments. Critically, this modification entails a change from fixed- to random-effects inference in ALE analysis allowing generalization of the results to the entire population of studies analyzed. By comparative analysis of real and simulated data, the authors showed that the revised ALE-algorithm overcomes conceptual problems of former meta-analyses and increases the specificity of the ensuing results without loosing the sensitivity of the original approach. It may thus provide a methodologically improved tool for coordinate-based meta-analyses on functional imaging data.

We have proposed that instead of explicit involvement in any particular motor, sensory, or cognitive task, the cerebellum performs a much more fundamental computation involving the active acquisition of sensory data. We carried out an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis to determine whether neuroimaging results obtained during a wide range of auditory tasks support this proposal. Specifically, we analyzed the coordinates of 231 activation foci obtained in 15 different auditory studies selected through an extensive search of the positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature. The studies selected represent a wide variety of purely auditory tasks using highly controlled synthesized acoustic stimuli. The results clearly revealed that in addition to temporal auditory areas of cerebral cortex, specific regions in the cerebellum are activated consistently across studies regardless of the particular auditory task involved. In particular, one area in left lateral crus I area showed the greatest volume and ALE peak value among the extratemporal regions. A subanalysis was carried out that ruled out the specific association of this cerebellar cluster with attentional demand. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum may play a role in purely sensory auditory processing, and are discussed in light of the broader idea of the cerebellum subserving a fundamental sensory function.

A systematic review of task-based fMRI studies of sleep deprivation vs. rested and also ADHD vs. healthy controls (HC) yielded 134 articles. fMRI coordinates were extracted for each contrast (i.e. \"ADHD vs. HC,\" \"TSD vs. Rested\") and normalized to the Talairach-atlas. Separate ALE analyses were performed for ADHD and sleep deprivation. We directly compared these initial estimates to determine shared vs. distinct areas of fMRI neural activation in ADHD and sleep deprivation. Conjunction analyses revealed overlapping hypoactivations between ADHD and sleep loss in executive function regions, notably the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Sleep deprivation, however, was associated with significantly exaggerated hyperactivation in the thalamus. Our study indicates that ADHD and sleep deprivation share a common neural signature: hypoactivation of executive function neuroanatomy. In contrast, sleep loss, but not ADHD, was associated with thalamic hyperactivations, intimating a potential compensatory response in sleep loss not present in ADHD. By elucidating shared and distinct patterns of functional neuroanatomy, these data provide novel targets for future experimental investigations of sleep loss in ADHD.

However, questions still remain about the exact neural substrates implicated in social reward and punishment processing. Here, we conducted four Anisotropic Effect Size Signed Differential Mapping voxel-based meta-analyses of fMRI studies investigating the neural correlates of the anticipation and receipt of social rewards and punishments using the Social Incentive Delay task. We found that the anticipation of both social rewards and social punishment avoidance recruits a wide network of areas including the basal ganglia, the midbrain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the supplementary motor area, the anterior insula, the occipital gyrus and other frontal, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions not captured in previous coordinate-based meta-analysis. We identified decreases in the BOLD signal during the anticipation of both social reward and punishment avoidance in regions of the default-mode network that were missed in individual studies likely due to a lack of power. Receipt of social rewards engaged a robust network of brain regions including the ventromedial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the occipital cortex and the brainstem, but not the basal ganglia. Receipt of social punishments increased the BOLD signal in the orbitofrontal cortex, superior and inferior frontal gyri, lateral occipital cortex and the insula. In contrast to the receipt of social rewards, we also observed a decrease in the BOLD signal in the basal ganglia in response to the receipt of social punishments. Our results provide a better understanding of the brain circuitry involved in the processing of social rewards and punishment. Furthermore, they can inform hypotheses regarding brain areas where disruption in activity may be associated with dysfunctional social incentive processing during disease.

Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on ~7500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional coactivation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling). ADHD-related hypoactivation was found in the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and the left temporal lobe to language semantics; both these regions clustered together on the basis of their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped to both executive function tasks and music-related processes. Our study provides meta-analytic support to the hypothesis that, in addition to well-known deficits in typical executive functions, impairment in processes related to music perception/reproduction and language semantics may be involved in the pathophysiology of adult ADHD.

Using fMRI, the MFC has been associated with diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to comprehensively map specific psychological functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies to identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine which psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2-4 smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite division within MFC, with each zone displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies. Activation of medial frontal cortex in fMRI studies is associated with a wide range of psychological states ranging from cognitive control to pain. However, this high rate of activation makes it challenging to determine how these various processes are topologically organized across medial frontal anatomy. We conducted a meta-analysis across nearly 10,000 studies to comprehensively map psychological states to discrete subregions in medial frontal cortex using relatively unbiased data-driven methods. This approach revealed three distinct zones that differed substantially in function, each of which were further subdivided into 2-4 smaller subregions that showed additional functional variation. Each individual region was recruited by multiple psychological states, suggesting subregions of medial frontal cortex are functionally heterogeneous.

Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis consisting of experimental tasks that investigate rumination by using Signed Differential Mapping of 14 fMRI studies comprising 286 healthy participants. Furthermore, rather than treat the DMN as a unitary network, we examined the contribution of three DMN subsystems to rumination. Results confirm the suspected association between rumination and DMN activation, specifically implicating the DMN core regions and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex subsystem. Based on these findings, we suggest a hypothesis of how DMN regions support rumination and present the implications of this model for treating major depressive disorder characterized by rumination.

A structured literature search was performed and studies with electrode-level data comparing fMRI and ESM for language localization were analyzed. Outcome measures included pooled estimates of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, and specificity. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with a meta-regression framework. Nine studies were included in the analysis having 5-40 patients with mean age 11.3-43.4 years. Verb generation and picture naming were the most common fMRI tasks, while picture naming was the most common ESM task. Sensitivity (0.37-0.95), specificity (0.36-0.97), and DOR (1.9-44.6) for fMRI compared to ESM varied widely across studies with statistically significant heterogeneities. Pooled estimates were: sensitivity 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.54, 0.83), specificity 0.74 (0.58, 0.85), and DOR 7.0 (3.5, 13.8), from a valid meta-analysis (area under the summary receiver-operating-curve 0.78). fMRI was noted to have higher sensitivity in studies using higher maximal ESM currents. fMRI variables could not be included in the meta-regression because of substantial methodological differences among studies. fMRI is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for language localization compared to ESM in well-designed studies. However, because the confidence limits for sensitivity and DOR are close to the line of no effect, and there is high unmeasured heterogeneity, fMRI cannot perhaps be used as the only modality for language localization to inform neurosurgical decisions at present.

The spatial consistency of peak activations associated with maltreatment exposure was tested using activation likelihood estimation, using a threshold of p < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Adults exposed to childhood maltreatment showed significantly increased activation in the left superior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, and decreased activation in the left superior parietal lobule and the left hippocampus. Although hyperresponsivity to socioaffective cues in the amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex in correlation with maltreatment severity is a replicated finding in region of interest studies, null results are reported as well. The findings suggest that childhood maltreatment has sustained effects on brain function into adulthood, and highlight potential mechanisms for conveying vulnerability to development of psychopathology.

We intended to have a meta-analytical study on recent functional neuroimaging studies to find the relationship between cognition in AD patients and normal elderlies. A systematic search was conducted to collect functional neuroimaging studies such as positron emission therapy (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in AD patients and healthy elderlies. The coordinates of regions related to cognition were meta-analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method and Sleuth software. P-value map at the false discovery rate (FDR) of P<0.05 thresholds and the clusters with a minimum size of 200 mm(3) were considered. Data were visualized with MANGO software. Forty-one articles that explored the areas activated during cognition in normal elderly subjects and AD patients were found. According to the findings, left middle frontal gyrus and left precuneus are the most activated areas in cognitional tasks in healthy elderlies and AD patients respectively. In normal elderly subjects and AD patients, comparison of ALE maps and reverse contrast showed that insula and left precuneus were the most activated areas in cognitional aspects respectively. With respect to unification of left precuneus activation in cognitional tasks, it seems that this point can be a hallmark in primary differentiation of AD and healthy individuals.

However, single studies usually provide limited insight into the function of specific brain regions. Hence, to better understand the interaction between key regions involved in emotion generation and regulation, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that examined emotion regulation-modulated connectivity of the amygdala using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. We analyzed fifteen PPI studies using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. Investigating emotion regulation-modulated connectivity independent of regulation strategy and goal revealed convergent connectivity between the amygdala and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), which was primarily driven by PPI studies implementing reappraisal as a regulation strategy. A more focused analysis testing for effective coupling during the down-regulation of emotions by using reappraisal specifically revealed convergent connectivity between the amygdala and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). These prefrontal regions have been implicated in emotion regulatory processes such as working memory (dlPFC), language processes (vlPFC), and the attribution of mental states (dmPFC). Our findings suggest not only a dynamic modulation of connectivity between emotion generative and regulatory systems during the cognitive control of emotions, but also highlight the robustness of task-modulated prefrontal-amygdala coupling, thereby informing neurally-derived models of emotion regulation.

Several studies have proved that abnormal brain activation was responsible for the deficit function of conscious emotion recognition in depression. However, the altered brain activation related to the conscious processing of emotion in depression was incongruent among studies. Therefore, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis to better understand the underlying neurophysiological mechanism of conscious processing of emotion in depression. Electronic databases were searched using the search terms \"depression,\" \"emotion recognition,\" and \"neuroimaging\" from inceptions to April 10th, 2023. We retrieved trials which explored the neuro-responses of depressive patients to explicit emotion recognition tasks. Two investigators independently performed literature selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the common reward network in the MDD brain and to further distinguish the brain activation patterns between positive stimuli and monetary rewards as well as reward anticipation and outcome. A series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were performed across 22 fMRI studies that examined reward-related processing, with a total of 341 MDD patients and 367 healthy controls. We observed several frontostriatal regions that participated in reward processing in MDD. The common reward network in MDD was characterized by decreased subcortical and limbic areas activity and an increased cortical response. In addition, the cerebellum, lingual gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus preferentially responded to positive stimuli in MDD, while the insula, precuneus, cuneus, PFC and inferior parietal lobule selectively responded to monetary rewards. Our results indicated a reduced caudate response during both monetary anticipation and outcome stages as well as increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate during reward anticipation in MDD. The reward-related tasks and mood states of patients included in our analysis were heterogeneous. Our current findings suggest that there exist emotional or motivational pathway dysfunctions in MDD during reward-related processing. Future studies may be strengthened by paying careful attention to the types of reward used as well as the different components of reward processing examined.

Can neuroimaging prove that schizophrenia is a brain disease? A radical hypothesis. Medical Hypotheses in press, corrected proof] that \"on the basis of the available imaging literature there is no consistent evidence to reject the radical and provocative hypothesis that schizophrenia is not a brain disease\". To achieve this goal, all meta-analyses on 'fMRI and schizophrenia' published during the current decade and indexed in Pubmed were summarized, as much as some other useful information, e.g., meta-analyses on genetic risk factors. Our main conclusion is that the literature fully supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a syndrome (not a disease) associated with brain abnormalities, despite the fact that there is no singular and reductionist pathway from the nosographic entity (schizophrenia) to its causes. This irreducibility is due to the fact that the syndrome has more than one dimension (e.g., cognitive, psychotic and negative) and each of them is related to abnormalities in specific neuronal networks. A psychiatric diagnosis is a statistical procedure; these dimensions are not identically represented in each diagnosticated case and this explains the existence of more than one pattern of brain abnormalities related to schizophrenia. For example, chronification is associated with negativism while the first psychotic episode is not; in that sense, the same person living with schizophrenia may reveal different symptoms and fMRI patterns along the course of his life, and this is precisely what defines schizophrenia since the time when it was called Dementia Praecox (first by pick then by Kraepelin). It is notable that 100% of the collected meta-analyses on 'fMRI and schizophrenia' reveal positive findings. Moreover, all meta-analyses that found positive associations between schizophrenia and genetic risk factors have to do with genes (SNPs) especially activated in neuronal tissue of the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that, to the extent these polymorphisms are related to schizophrenia's etiology, they are also related to abnormal brain activity.

However, clinical observations suggest that patients often maintain their expectations regardless of experiences contradicting their expectations. It remains unclear which information processing mechanisms lead to modification or persistence of patients' expectations. Insight in the processing could be provided by Neuroimaging studies investigating prediction error (PE, i.e., neuronal reactions to non-expected stimuli). Two methods are often used to investigate the PE: (1) paradigms, in which participants passively observe PEs (\"passive\" paradigms) and (2) paradigms, which encourage a behavioral adaptation following a PE (\"active\" paradigms). These paradigms are similar to the methods used to induce expectation violations in clinical settings: (1) the confrontation with an expectation violation situation and (2) an enhanced confrontation in which the patient actively challenges his expectation. We used this similarity to gain insight in the different neuronal processing of the two PE paradigms. We performed a meta-analysis contrasting neuronal activity of PE paradigms encouraging a behavioral adaptation following a PE and paradigms enforcing passiveness following a PE. We found more neuronal activity in the striatum, the insula and the fusiform gyrus in studies encouraging behavioral adaptation following a PE. Due to the involvement of reward assessment and avoidance learning associated with the striatum and the insula we propose that the deliberate execution of action alternatives following a PE is associated with the integration of new information into previously existing expectations, therefore leading to an expectation change. While further research is needed to directly assess expectations of participants, this study provides new insights into the information processing mechanisms following an expectation violation.

The general ALE revealed that VAE relies on a bilateral network of areas, and the individual ALE analyses revealed different maximal activation for the artworks' categories as function of their content. Specifically, different content-dependent areas of the ventral visual stream are involved in VAE, but a few additional brain areas are involved as well. Thus, aesthetic-related neural responses to art recruit widely distributed networks in both hemispheres including content-dependent brain areas of the ventral visual stream.

How this information is combined and processed to form conscious perceptions of limb position is still relatively unknown. Several functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to tease out the brain areas responsible for proprioceptive processing in the human brain. Yet there still exists some disagreement in the specific brain regions involved. In order to consolidate the current knowledge in the field, we performed a systematic review of the literature and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of proprioception. We identified 12 studies that used a proprioceptive stimulus of the upper extremity for ALE analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0141 participants). Two types of stimuli (illusion of movement induced through muscle tendon vibration and passive/imposed movements) were found to be most commonly used to probe proprioceptive networks in the brain. ALE analysis of these two stimulus types revealed that both were associated with activation in the left precentral, postcentral, and anterior cingulate gyri. Interestingly, different patterns of activation were also observed between illusions of movement and imposed movement. In the left hemisphere, imposed movements resulted in activations that were more inferior in the post-central gyrus. In the right hemisphere, imposed movements resulted in two clusters of activation in the inferior aspect of the precentral gyrus and the hand area of the post-central gyrus, while illusions of movement resulted in a single cluster of activation in the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that illusions of movement without limb displacement may activate different brain areas compared with actual limb displacement. Careful consideration should be made in future studies when selecting a proprioceptive stimulus to probe these brain networks.

Using just the reported coordinates it is also possible to meta-analyse coactivated regions to reveal a network-like structure of coordinate clusters (network nodes) distributed at the coactivated locations and a measure of the coactivation strength (network edges), which is determined by the presence/absence of reported activation. Here a new coordinate-based method to estimate a network of coactivations is detailed, which utilises the Z score accompanying each reported. Coordinate based meta-analysis of networks (CBMAN) assumes that if the activation pattern reported by independent studies is truly consistent, then the relative magnitude of these Z scores might also be consistent. It is hypothesised that this is detectable as Z score covariance between coactivated regions provided the within study variances are small. Advantages of using the Z scores instead of coordinates to measure coactivation strength are that censoring by the significance thresholds can be considered, and that using a continuous measure rather than a dichotomous one can increase statistical power. CBMAN uses maximum likelihood estimation to fit multivariate normal distributions to the standardised Z scores, and the covariances are considered as edges of a network of coactivated clusters (nodes). Here it is validated by numerical simulation and demonstrated on real data used previously to demonstrate CBMA. Software to perform CBMAN is freely available.

This paper aims to review fMRI and PET studies of altered auditory feedback and assess the strength of the evidence these studies provide for a speech error correction mechanism. Studies included were functional neuroimaging studies of speech production in neurotypical adult humans, using natural speech errors or one of three predefined speech manipulation techniques (frequency altered feedback, delayed auditory feedback, and masked auditory feedback). Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. In a systematic review, we evaluated whether each study (1) used an ecologically valid speech production task, (2) controlled for auditory activation caused by hearing the perturbation, (3) statistically controlled for multiple comparisons, and (4) measured behavioral compensation correlating with perturbation. None of the studies met all four criteria. We then conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of brain coordinates from 16 studies that reported brain responses to manipulated over unmanipulated speech feedback, using the GingerALE toolbox. These foci clustered in bilateral superior temporal gyri, anterior to cortical fields typically linked to error correction. Within the limits of our analysis, we conclude that existing neuroimaging evidence is insufficient to determine whether error monitoring occurs in the posterior superior temporal gyrus regions proposed by models of speech production.

Functional neuroimaging studies have yielded abnormal task-related sensorimotor activation in dystonia, but the results appear to be rather variable across studies. Further, study size was usually small including different types of dystonia. Here we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies in patients with primary dystonia to test for convergence of dystonia-related alterations in task-related activity across studies. Activation likelihood estimates were based on previously reported regional maxima of task-related increases or decreases in dystonia patients compared to healthy controls. The meta-analyses encompassed data from 179 patients with dystonia reported in 18 functional neuroimaging studies using a range of sensorimotor tasks. Patients with dystonia showed bilateral increases in task-related activation in the parietal operculum and ventral postcentral gyrus as well as right middle temporal gyrus. Decreases in task-related activation converged in left supplementary motor area and left postcentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus and dorsal midbrain. Apart from the midbrain cluster, all between-group differences in task-related activity were retrieved in a sub-analysis including only the 14 studies on patients with focal dystonia. For focal dystonia, an additional cluster of increased sensorimotor activation emerged in the caudal cingulate motor zone. The results show that dystonia is consistently associated with abnormal somatosensory processing in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex along with abnormal sensorimotor activation of mesial premotor and right lateral temporal cortex.
