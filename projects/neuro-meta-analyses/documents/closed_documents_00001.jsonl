The identification of objective biomarkers, such as functional and structural brain abnormalities of BD might improve diagnosis and help elucidate its pathophysiology. To identify neurobiological markers of BD, two meta-analyses, one of functional neuroimaging studies related to emotional processing and a second of structural whole-brain neuroimaging studies in BD were conducted in the present study. Conducting a literature search on studies published up to September 2009 we identified 28 studies that were eligible for the meta-analyses: 13 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, related to emotional processing and 15 structural imaging studies using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry. Only studies comparing patients with bipolar disorder to healthy controls were considered. Data were extracted or converted to a single anatomical reference (Talairach space). The activation likelihood estimation technique was used to assess the voxel-wise correspondence of results between studies. In patients with BD, decreased activation and diminution of gray matter were identified in a cortical-cognitive brain network that has been associated with the regulation of emotions. By contrast, patients with BD exhibited increased activation in ventral limbic brain regions that mediate the experience of emotions and generation of emotional responses. The present study provides evidence for functional and anatomical alterations in BD in brain networks associated with the experience and regulation of emotions. These alterations support previously proposed neurobiological models of BD and might represent valid neurobiological markers of the disorder. The specificity of these results to unipolar depression remains to be explored.

We found evidence of a partial dissociation between IBT and ECT. IBT relies on a subset of areas also involved in ECT, however ECT tasks activate SMA, right IFG, left precentral gyrus and INS in a significantly stronger way.

Left posterior/dorsal putamen showed hyperactivation during executive processing tasks, while predominantly right anterior/ventral putamen showed hyperactivation during emotional processing tasks.

By manipulating the integration of multisensory signals and creating the illusory experience of owning external body parts and entire bodies, researchers have investigated the neurofunctional correlates of body ownership. Recent attempts to synthesize the neuroimaging literature of body ownership through meta-analysis have shown partly inconsistent results. A large proportion of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings on body ownership include analyses based on regions of interest (ROIs). This approach can produce inflated findings when results are synthesized in meta-analyses. We conducted a systematic search of the fMRI literature of ownership of body parts and entire bodies. Three activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were conducted, testing the impact of including ROI-based findings. When both whole-brain and ROI-based results were included, frontal and posterior parietal multisensory areas were associated with body ownership. When only ROI-based results were included, larger areas of the frontal and posterior parietal cortices and the middle occipital gyrus were associated with body ownership. A whole-brain meta-analysis, excluding ROI-based results, found no significant convergence of activation across the brain. These findings highlight the difficulty of quantitatively synthesizing a neuroimaging field where a large part of the literature is based on findings from ROI-based analyses. We discuss these findings in the light of current practices within this field of research and highlight current problems of meta-analytic approaches of body ownership. We recommend the sharing of unthresholded data as a means to facilitate future meta-analyses of the neuroimaging literature of body ownership.

This approach is extremely versatile and encompasses previously published results [Goutte et al., 1999] as special cases. A typical application is in data reduction: as the increase in temporal resolution of fMRI experiments routinely yields fMRI sequences containing several hundreds of images, it is sometimes necessary to invoke feature extraction to reduce the dimensionality of the data space. A second interesting application is in the meta-analysis of fMRI experiment, where features are obtained from a possibly large number of single-voxel analyses. In particular this allows the checking of the differences and agreements between different methods of analysis. Both approaches are illustrated on a fMRI data set involving visual stimulation, and we show that the feature space clustering approach yields nontrivial results and, in particular, shows interesting differences between individual voxel analysis performed with traditional methods.

Numerous studies have examined DMN functional connectivity in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a presumed AD precursor, to discover a biomarker of AD risk. Prior reviews were qualitative or limited in scope or approach. We aimed to systematically and quantitatively review DMN resting state fMRI studies comparing MCI and healthy comparison (HC) groups. PubMed was searched for relevant articles. Study characteristics were abstracted and the number of studies showing no group difference or hyper- versus hypo-connnectivity in MCI was tallied. A voxel-wise (ES-SDM) meta-analysis was conducted to identify regional group differences. Qualitatively, our review of 57 MCI versus HC comparisons suggests substantial inconsistency; 9 showed no group difference, 8 showed MCI\u200a>\u200aHC and 22 showed HC\u200a>\u200aMCI across the brain, and 18 showed regionally-mixed directions of effect. The meta-analysis of 31 studies revealed areas of significant hypo- and hyper-connectivity in MCI, including hypoconnectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (z\u200a=\u200a-3.1, p\u200a<\u200a0.0001). Very few individual studies, however, showed patterns resembling the meta-analytic results. Methodological differences did not appear to explain inconsistencies. The pattern of altered resting DMN function or connectivity in MCI is complex and variable across studies. To date, no index of DMN connectivity qualifies as a useful biomarker of MCI or risk for AD. Refinements to MCI diagnosis, including other biological markers, or longitudinal studies of progression to AD, might identify DMN alterations predictive of AD risk.

Downregulation of the amygdala is one of the hallmarks of successful emotion regulation. Top-down inhibition of the amygdala is thought to involve activation of the executive control network. This reciprocal relationship, however, is not exclusive to explicit emotion regulation. It has been noted that any cognitively demanding task that activates executive control network may downregulate the amygdala, including a standard working memory task. Such downregulation is likely established in a load-dependent fashion with more cognitive demand leading to stronger deactivation. Using a coordinate-based meta-analysis, we examined whether a standard working memory task downregulates the amygdala similarly to cognitive reappraisal. We found that a standard 2-back working memory task indeed systematically downregulates the amygdala and that deactivated clusters strongly overlap with those observed during a cognitive reappraisal task. This finding may have consequences for the interpretation of the underlying mechanism of cognitive reappraisal: amygdala downregulation may be related to the cognitively demanding nature of reappraisal and not per se by the act of the reappraisal itself.

However, the time-varying patterns of connectome topology in individuals with ASD and the connection between these patterns and gene expression profiles remain unknown. To investigate case-control differences in dynamic connectome topology, we conducted mega- and meta-analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 939 participants (440 patients with ASD and 499 healthy control subjects, all males) from 18 independent sites, selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Functional data were preprocessed and analyzed using harmonized protocols, and brain module dynamics was assessed using a multilayer network model. We further leveraged postmortem brain-wide gene expression data to identify transcriptomic signatures associated with ASD-related alterations in brain dynamics. Compared with healthy control participants, individuals with ASD exhibited a higher global mean and lower standard deviation of whole-brain module dynamics, indicating an unstable and less regionally differentiated pattern. More specifically, individuals with ASD showed higher module switching, primarily in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and angular gyrus, and lower switching in the visual regions. These alterations in brain dynamics were predictive of social impairments in individuals with ASD and were linked with expression profiles of genes primarily involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter transport and secretion as well as with previously identified autism-related genes. This study is the first to identify consistent alterations in brain network dynamics in ASD and the transcriptomic signatures related to those alterations, furthering insights into the biological basis behind this disorder.

The neurobiology of smoking cue reactivity has been investigated in several fMRI studies. We combined the results of these studies using activation likelihood estimation, a meta-analytic technique for fMRI data. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that smoking cues reliably evoke larger fMRI responses than neutral cues in the extended visual system, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum. Subtraction meta-analyses revealed that parts of the extended visual system and dorsal prefrontal cortex are more reliably responsive to smoking cues in deprived smokers than in non-deprived smokers, and that short-duration cues presented in event-related designs produce larger responses in the extended visual system than long-duration cues presented in blocked designs. The areas that were found to be responsive to smoking cues agree with theories of the neurobiology of cue reactivity, with two exceptions. First, there was a reliable cue reactivity effect in the precuneus, which is not typically considered a brain region important to addiction. Second, we found no significant effect in the nucleus accumbens, an area that plays a critical role in addiction, but this effect may have been due to technical difficulties associated with measuring fMRI data in that region. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the extended visual system should receive more attention in future studies of smoking cue reactivity.

Empirical studies consistently report poorer emotion recognition performance in patients with schizophrenia as well as in individuals at enhanced risk of schizophrenia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies also report consistent patterns of abnormal brain activation in response to emotional stimuli in patients, in particular, decreased amygdala activation. In contrast, brain-level abnormalities in at-risk individuals are more elusive. We address this gap using an image-based meta-analysis of the functional magnetic resonance imaging literature. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating brain responses to negative emotional stimuli and reporting a comparison between at-risk individuals and healthy control subjects were identified. Frequentist and Bayesian voxelwise meta-analyses were performed separately, by implementing a random-effect model with unthresholded group-level T-maps from individual studies as input. In total, 17 studies with a cumulative total of 677 at-risk individuals and 805 healthy control subjects were included. Frequentist analyses did not reveal significant differences between at-risk individuals and healthy control subjects. Similar results were observed with Bayesian analyses, which provided strong evidence for the absence of meaningful brain activation differences across the entire brain. Region of interest analyses specifically focusing on the amygdala confirmed the lack of group differences in this region. These results suggest that brain activation patterns in response to emotional stimuli are unlikely to constitute a reliable endophenotype of schizophrenia. We suggest that future studies instead focus on impaired functional connectivity as an alternative and promising endophenotype.

The aim of our study was to perform a meta-analysis of whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that compared adult healthy relatives of patients with schizophrenia and controls. Twenty-one whole-brain fMRI studies were included (17 using cognitive tasks and four using emotional tasks), published between 2003 and 2013. These studies included 467 healthy relatives of patients with schizophrenia and 768 controls. To conduct the statistical analysis, we used the effect-size signed differential mapping software, a voxel-based meta-analytic approach. In healthy relatives of patients with schizophrenia, we observed a general pattern of overactivation across the 21 fMRI studies in right-sided frontal, parietal and temporal regions compared to controls. This pattern was accompanied by an underactivation in the cingulate gyrus. Our analyses showed a very similar pattern during purely cognitive tasks; during emotional tasks, healthy relatives additionally overactivated the left parahippocampal gyrus. This fMRI pattern of prefrontal overactivation and hypoactivation of the cingulate gyrus may represent a candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia.

Neuroimaging helps physicians diagnose mental illnesses and find novel treatments for them. It can distinguish depression from neurodegenerative diseases or brain tumors, and it can reveal structural defects that cause psychosis. Psychosis has been linked to lesions in the frontal or temporal lobes of the brain, as well as the thalamus and hypothalamus, which can be detected using a brain scan for mental illnesses. Neuroimaging uses quantitative and computational methods to explore the central nervous system. It can detect brain injuries and psychological illnesses. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using neuroimaging to detect psychiatric disorders assessed their efficacy and benefits. Appropriate articles were searched from PubMed, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases using the appropriate keywords as per the PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials and open-label studies were included as per the predefined PICOS criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan software, and statistical parameters like odds ratio and risk difference were calculated. Twelve randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 655 psychiatric patients were included following the criteria from the year 2000 to 2022. We included studies that use different neuroimaging techniques for the detection of organic brain lesions that would help diagnose psychiatric disorders. The primary outcome was detecting brain abnormalities in diverse psychiatric illnesses with neuroimaging versus conventional methods. We found the odds ratio value of 2.29 (95% CI 1.49-3.51). The results were heterogeneous with a Tau2 value of 0.38, chi2 value of 35.48, df value of 11, I2 value of 69%, the z value of 3.78, and p-value less than 0.05.

Recently, studies have begun to explore the association between structural and functional grey matter abnormalities. By conducting a meta-analysis on morphometric and functional imaging studies of grey matter alterations in drug-free patients, the present study aims to examine the degree of overlap between brain regions with anatomic and functional changes in patients with schizophrenia. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant publications. A multimodal analysis was then conducted using Seed-based d Mapping software. Exploratory analyses included jackknife, subgroup and meta-regression analyses. We included 15 structural MRI studies comprising 486 drug-free patients and 485 healthy controls, and 16 functional MRI studies comprising 403 drug-free patients and 428 controls in our meta-analysis. Drug-free patients were examined to reduce pharmacological effects on the imaging data. Multimodal analysis showed considerable overlap between anatomic and functional changes, mainly in frontotemporal regions, bilateral medial posterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, bilateral insula, basal ganglia and left cerebellum. There were also brain regions showing only anatomic changes in the right superior frontal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, right lingual gyrus and functional alternations involving the right angular gyrus. The methodological aspects, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous, and we cannot exclude medication effects. The present study showed overlapping anatomic and functional brain abnormalities mainly in the default mode (DMN) and auditory networks (AN) in drug-free patients with schizophrenia. However, the pattern of changes differed in these networks. Decreased grey matter was associated with decreased activation within the DMN, whereas it was associated with increased activation within the AN. These discrete patterns suggest different pathophysiological changes impacting structural and functional associations within different neural networks in patients with schizophrenia.

However, identifying patterns of large-scale network abnormality in BD has been elusive. Whole-brain seed-based rs-FC and VBM studies comparing individuals with BD and healthy controls (HCs) were retrieved from multiple databases. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify brain networks in which BD was linked to hyper-connectivity or hypo-connectivity with each prior network and the overlap between dysconnectivity and GMV changes. Thirty-six seed-based rs-FC publications (1526 individuals with BD and 1578 HCs) and 70 VBM publications (2715 BD and 3044 HCs) were included in the meta-analysis. Our results showed that BD was characterized by hypo-connectivity within the default network (DN), hyper-connectivity within the affective network (AN), and ventral attention network (VAN) and hypo- and hyper-connectivity within the frontoparietal network (FN). Hyper-connectivity between-network of AN-DN, AN-FN, AN-VAN, AN-thalamus network (TN), VAN-TN, VAN-DN, VAN-FN, and TN-sensorimotor network were found. Hypo-connectivity between-network of FN and DN was observed. Decreased GMV was found in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. Differential weights in the number of included studies and sample size of FC and VBM might have a disproportionate influence on the meta-analytic results.

Growing evidence highlights graded contributions to their semantic processing by the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), where the omni-category response displayed by its ventrolateral sector might reflect the integration of information relayed from other regions. Among these, the superior polar ATL was specifically associated with representing social concepts. However, most previous studies neglected the close relationship between social and emotional semantic features, which might confound interpreting the degree of overlap vs. specificity of social and emotional conceptual processing. We addressed this issue via two activation-likelihood-estimation meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies reporting brain structures associated with processing social or emotional concepts. Alongside a common involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, we found social and emotional concepts to be specifically associated with lateral temporal areas (including the superior polar ATL) and the amygdala, respectively. These results support the specialization of distinct sectors of the fronto-temporo-limbic circuitry for processing social vs. emotional concepts, and the integration of their output in medial prefrontal regions underlying the regulation of social behavior. These results pave the way for further studies addressing the neural bases of conceptual knowledge, its impairment after fronto-temporal brain damage, and the effect of rehabilitative interventions targeting its main functional modules.

All data regarding the amygdala, hippocampus, corpus callosum, brain, and intracranial volumes that fit the inclusion criteria were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis that assessed differences between groups. The meta-analysis found reduced total corpus callosum areas and reduced total cerebral and intracranial volumes in the patients with PTSD. The total hippocampus (left and right hippocampus) and gray matter volumes of the amygdala and frontal lobe were also reduced, but these differences were not significant. The functional studies revealed differences in brain region activation in response to stimuli in the post-traumatic stress symptoms/PTSD group.

Most consistently across 28 experiments vestibular stimuli evoked activity in the right hemispheric parietal opercular area OP 2 implicating it as the core region for vestibular processing. Furthermore, we took our primary results as a seeding point and fed them into a functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state oscillations in 100 healthy subjects. This subsequent calculation confirmed direct connections of the area OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. Thus revealing a joint vestibular network in accordance with a concept from animal literature termed the inner vestibular circle. Moreover, there was also a significant vestibular connectivity overlap with frontal but not parietal cortical centres responsible for the generation of saccadic eye movements, likely to be involved in nystagmus fast phase generation. This was shown in an additional ocular motor meta-analysis. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex.

In recent years, many acupuncture brain imaging studies have found significant changes in brain function following acupuncture treatment of migraine, providing a new perspective to elucidate the mechanism of action of acupuncture. To analyse and summarize the effects of acupuncture on the modulation of specific patterns of brain region activity changes in migraine patients, thus providing a mechanism for treating migraine by acupuncture. Chinese and English articles published up to May 2022 were searched in three English databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane) and four Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure, CNKI; Chinese Biomedical Literature database, CBM; the Chongqing VIP database, VIP; and the Wanfang database, WF). A neuroimaging meta-analysis on ALFF, ReHo was performed on the included studies using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) software. Subgroup analyses were used to compare differences in brain regions between acupuncture and other groups. Meta-regression was used to explore the effect of demographic information and migraine alterations on brain imaging outcomes. Linear models were drawn using MATLAB 2018a, and visual graphs for quality evaluation were produced using R and RStudio software. A total of 7 studies comprising 236 patients in the treatment group and 173 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment helps to improve pain symptoms in patients with migraine. The left angular gyrus is hyperactivation, and the left superior frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus are hypoactivated. The migraine group showed hyperactivation in the corpus callosum compared to healthy controls. Acupuncture can significantly regulate changes in brain regions in migraine patients. However, due to the experimental design of neuroimaging standards are not uniform, the results also have some bias.

Based on a preregistered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42019119553), a large set of databases were searched up to April 9, 2019, with no language or article type restrictions. Study authors were systematically contacted for additional unpublished information/data. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using seed-based connectivity (SBC) or any other method (non-SBC) reporting whole-brain results of group comparisons between participants with ADHD and typically developing controls were eligible. Voxelwise meta-analysis via activation likelihood estimation with cluster-level familywise error (voxel-level: p\u00a0< .001; cluster-level: p\u00a0< .05) was used. Thirty studies (18 SBC and 12 non-SBC), comprising 1,978 participants (1,094 with ADHD; 884 controls) were retained. The meta-analysis focused on SBC studies found no significant spatial convergence of ADHD-related hyperconnectivity or hypoconnectivity across studies. This nonsignificant finding remained after integrating 12 non-SBC studies into the main analysis and in sensitivity analyses limited to studies including only children or only non-medication-na\u00efve patients. The lack of significant spatial convergence may be accounted for by heterogeneity in study participants, experimental procedures, and analytic flexibility as well as in ADHD pathophysiology. Alongside other neuroimaging meta-analyses in other psychiatric conditions, the present results should inform the conduct and publication of future neuroimaging studies of psychiatric disorders.

Along with such externally guided decision-making, there are instances of decision-making in which no correct answer based on external circumstances is available for the subject (internally guided decision-making). Such decisions are usually made in the context of moral decision-making as well as in preference judgment, where the answer depends on the subject's own, i.e., internal, preferences rather than on external, i.e., circumstantial, criteria. The neuronal and psychological mechanisms that allow guidance of decisions based on more internally oriented criteria in the absence of external ones remain unclear. This study was undertaken to compare decision-making of these two kinds empirically and theoretically. First, we reviewed studies of decision-making to clarify experimental-operational differences between externally guided and internally guided decision-making. Second, using multi-level kernel density analysis, a whole-brain-based quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies was performed. Our meta-analysis revealed that the neural network used predominantly for internally guided decision-making differs from that for externally guided decision-making under uncertainty. This result suggests that studying only externally guided decision-making under uncertainty is insufficient to account for decision-making processes in the brain.

Although there are some recent human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that have addressed this idea directly in the memory and spatial processing domains and provided support for it, there has been no broader meta-analysis of the fMRI literature to determine if there is consistent evidence for functional dissociations in anterior and posterior hippocampus across all of the different cognitive domains in which the hippocampus participates. The purpose of this review is to address this gap in our knowledge using three approaches. One approach involved PubMed searches to identify relevant fMRI papers reporting hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, working memory, spatial navigation, simulation/scene construction, transitive inference, and social cognition tasks. The second was to use a large meta-analytic database (neurosynth) to find text terms and coactivation maps associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions identified in the literature search. The third approach was to contrast the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions using a publicly available database that includes a large sample of adults. These three approaches provided converging evidence that not only are cognitive processes differently distributed along the hippocampal axis, but there also are distinct areas coactivated and functionally connected with the anterior and posterior segments. This anterior/posterior distinction involving multiple cognitive domains is consistent with the animal literature and provides strong support from fMRI for the idea of functional dissociations across the long axis of the hippocampus.

Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: young (23.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.63 years) and older (66.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.70 years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula, claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement.

From the theoretical point of view, it has been suggested a generalized local over-connectivity that would characterize ASD. This stance is known as the general local over-connectivity theory. However, there is little empirical evidence supporting such hypothesis, especially with regard to pediatric individuals with ASD (age [Formula: see text] 18\u00a0years old). To explore this issue, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of regional homogeneity studies to identify significant changes of local connectivity. Our analyses revealed local functional under-connectivity patterns in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus (key components of the default mode network) and in the bilateral paracentral lobule (a part of the sensorimotor network). We also performed a functional association analysis of the identified areas, whose dysfunction is clinically consistent with the well-known deficits affecting individuals with ASD. Importantly, we did not find relevant clusters of local hyper-connectivity, which is contrary to the hypothesis that ASD may be characterized by generalized local over-connectivity. If confirmed, our result will provide a valuable insight into the understanding of the complex ASD pathophysiology.

An overlapping anatomical result was obtained from the meta-analysis of extinction recall studies, except when studies directly compared an extinguished threat stimulus to an unextinguished threat stimulus (instead of a safety stimulus). In this latter instance, more consistent activation was observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions, together with other areas including the hippocampus.

Studies were included in the analyses when contrasting tasks that require the processing of mental states with tasks which did not. Only studies that investigated patients with an ICD or DSM diagnosis were included. Quantitative voxel-based meta-analyses were done using Seed-based d Mapping software. Common TOM regions like medial-prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal junction revealed abnormal activation in schizophrenic patients: Under-activation was identified in the medial prefrontal cortex, left orbito-frontal cortex, and in a small section of the left posterior temporo-parietal junction. Remarkably, robust over-activation was identified in a more dorsal, bilateral section of the temporo-parietal junction. Further abnormal activation was identified in medial occipito-parietal cortex, right premotor areas, left cingulate gyrus, and lingual gyrus. The findings of this study suggest that SZ patients simultaneously show over- and under-activation in TOM-related regions. Especially interesting, temporo-parietal junction reveals diverging activation patterns with an under-activating left posterior and an over-activating bilateral dorsal section.

Dysregulations in these circuits may contribute to drug-seeking and drug-consuming behaviour by impeding inhibitory control, habit formation, and reward processing. Despite evidence of network-level changes in SUD, a shared pattern of functional alterations within and between spatially distributed brain networks has not been systematically investigated. The present meta-analytic investigation aims at identifying common alterations in resting-state functional connectivity patterns across different SUD, including stimulant, heroin, alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use. To this aim, seed-based whole-brain connectivity maps for different functional networks were extracted and subjected to multi-level kernel density analysis to identify dysfunctional networks in individuals with SUD compared with healthy controls. In addition, an exploratory analysis examined substance-specific effects as well as the influence of drug use status on the main findings. Our findings indicate a hypoconnectivity pattern for the limbic, salience, and frontoparietal networks in individuals with SUD as compared with healthy controls. The default mode network additionally exhibited a complex pattern of hypo- and hyperconnectivity across the studies. The observed disrupted connectivity between networks in SUD may associate with deficient inhibitory control mechanisms that are thought to contribute to excessive craving and automatic drug-related behaviour as well as failure in substance use cessation. The identified network-based alterations in SUD represent potential treatment targets for neuromodulation, for example, network-based real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback. Such interventions can evaluate the behavioural relevance of the identified neural circuits.

These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, replicating results in animals, or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena. It has remained difficult, however, to synthesize these findings into a systems neuroscience account of how networks across the whole-brain support the enhancing effects of emotion on memory encoding. To this end, the present study employed a meta-analytic approach using activation likelihood estimates to assess the anatomical specificity and reliability of event-related fMRI activations related to successful memory encoding for emotional versus neutral information. The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala, anterior hippocampus, anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the ventral visual stream, left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex. The results within the amygdala and MTL support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects. The consistency of findings in cortical targets, including the visual, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, underscores the importance of generating hypotheses regarding their participation in emotional memory formation.

However, findings were inconsistent in each group and cannot be compared to each other. We first identified neuroimaging experiments that revealed abnormal neural activities during emotional processing in patients with major depressive disorder published from January 1997 to January 2019. Then we conducted voxel-wise meta-analyses on adult and youth patients separately and compared the two age groups using direct meta-comparison. Fifty-four studies comprising 1141 patients and 1242 healthy controls were identified. Both adult and youth patients showed abnormal neural activities in anterior cingulate cortex, insula, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and occipital cortex compared to healthy controls. However, hyperactivities in the superior and middle frontal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were only observed in adult patients, while hyperactivity in the striatum was only found in youth patients compared to controls. In addition, compared with youths, adult patients exhibited significantly greater abnormal activities in insula, middle frontal gyrus, and hippocampus, and significantly lower abnormal activities in middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and striatum. The common alterations confirmed the negative processing bias in major depressive disorder. Both adult and youth patients were suggested to have disturbed emotional perception, appraisal, and reactivity. However, adult patients might be more subject to the impaired appraisal and reactivity processes, while youth patients were more subject to the impaired perception process. These findings help us understand the progressive pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.

These can contribute to aberrant language and social communication skills in ASD. The study of the neural basis of speech perception in ASD can serve as a potential neurobiological marker of ASD early on, but mixed results across studies renders it difficult to find a reliable neural characterization of speech processing in ASD. To this aim, the present study examined the functional neural basis of speech perception in ASD versus typical development (TD) using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 18 qualifying studies. The present study included separate analyses for TD and ASD, which allowed us to examine patterns of within-group brain activation as well as both common and distinct patterns of brain activation across the ASD and TD groups. Overall, ASD and TD showed mostly common brain activation of speech processing in bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the results revealed trends for some distinct activation in the TD group showing additional activation in higher-order brain areas including left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and right IFG. These results provide a more reliable neural characterization of speech processing in ASD relative to previous single neuroimaging studies and motivate future work to investigate how these brain signatures relate to behavioral measures of speech processing in ASD.

The DMN is divided into three subsystems: a midline Core, a dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) subsystem, and a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem. We examined resting-state functional connectivity within and between DMN subsystems in MDD and its association with rumination. First, we conducted a meta-analysis on a large multi-site dataset of 618 MDD and 683 controls to quantify the differences in DMN subsystem functional connectivity between MDD and controls. Second, we tested the association of DMN subsystem functional connectivity and rumination in a sample of 115 unmedicated participants with symptoms of anxiety/depression and 48 controls.

Voxel-wise meta-analyses of abnormal task-evoked regional activity were conducted for adults with substance dependence (SD) and behavioral addiction during response inhibition tasks to solve previous inconsistencies. Twenty-three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies including 479 substance users, 38 individuals with behavioral addiction and 494 HCs were identified. Compared with HCs, all addictions showed hypo-activities in regions within FPN (inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) and VAN (inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole and insula), and hyper-activities in the cerebellum during response inhibition. SD subgroup showed almost the same activity patterns, with an additional hypoactivation of the precentral gyrus, compared with HCs. Stronger activation of the cerebellum was associated with longer addiction duration for adults with SD. We could not conduct meta-analytic investigations into the behavioral addiction subgroup due to the small number of datasets. This meta-analysis revealed altered activation of FPN, VAN and the cerebellum in adults with addiction during response inhibition tasks using non-addiction-related stimuli.

However, divergent results from these studies revealed both hypoactivation and hyperactivation of neural resources after injury. We hypothesized that at least part of this variance can be explained by distinct demands between WM tasks. Notably, in this literature some WM tasks use discrete periods of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, whereas others place continuous demands on WM. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine the differences in neural recruitment after mTBI to determine if divergent findings can be explained as a function of task demand and cognitive load. A comprehensive literature review revealed 14 studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity of individuals with mTBI during working memory tasks. Three of the fourteen studies included reported hypoactivity, five reported hyperactivity, and the remaining six reported both hypoactivity and hyperactivity. Studies were grouped according to task type and submitted to GingerALE maximum likelihood meta-analyses to determine the most consistent brain activation patterns. The primary findings from this meta-analysis suggest that the discrepancy in activation patterns is at least partially attributable to the classification of WM task, with hyperactivation being observed in continuous tasks and hypoactivation being observed during discrete tasks. We anticipate that differential task load expressed in continuous and discrete WM tasks contributes to these differences. Implications for the interpretation of fMRI signals in clinical samples are discussed.

The results of those investigations, however, vary considerably; moreover, previous meta-analyses also yielded inconsistent findings. To readdress aberrant brain activation in UD as evidenced by neuroimaging experiments on cognitive and/or emotional processing. Neuroimaging experiments published from January 1, 1997, to October 1, 2015, were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using different combinations of the terms fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), neural, major depression, depression, major depressive disorder, unipolar depression, dysthymia, emotion, emotional, affective, cognitive, task, memory, working memory, inhibition, control, n-back, and Stroop. Neuroimaging experiments (using fMRI or PET) reporting whole-brain results of group comparisons between adults with UD and healthy control individuals as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space and using an emotional or/and cognitive challenging task were selected. Coordinates reported to show significant activation differences between UD and healthy controls during emotional or cognitive processing were extracted. By using the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm, different meta-analyses were calculated. Meta-analyses tested for brain regions consistently found to show aberrant brain activation in UD compared with controls. Analyses were calculated across all emotional processing experiments, all cognitive processing experiments, positive emotion processing, negative emotion processing, experiments using emotional face stimuli, experiments with a sex discrimination task, and memory processing. All meta-analyses were calculated across experiments independent of reporting an increase or decrease of activity in major depressive disorder. For meta-analyses with a minimum of 17 experiments available, separate analyses were performed for increases and decreases. In total, 57 studies with 99 individual neuroimaging experiments comprising in total 1058 patients were included; 34 of them tested cognitive and 65 emotional processing. Overall analyses across cognitive processing experiments (P\u2009>\u2009.29) and across emotional processing experiments (P\u2009>\u2009.47) revealed no significant results. Similarly, no convergence was found in analyses investigating positive (all P\u2009>\u2009.15), negative (all P\u2009>\u2009.76), or memory (all P\u2009>\u2009.48) processes. Analyses that restricted inclusion of confounds (eg, medication, comorbidity, age) did not change the results. Inconsistencies exist across individual experiments investigating aberrant brain activity in UD and replication problems across previous neuroimaging meta-analyses. For individual experiments, these inconsistencies may relate to use of uncorrected inference procedures, differences in experimental design and contrasts, or heterogeneous clinical populations; meta-analytically, differences may be attributable to varying inclusion and exclusion criteria or rather liberal statistical inference approaches.

Whether or not adaptive and pathological anxiety share mechanisms remains unknown, but if they do, induced (adaptive) anxiety could be used as an intermediate translational model of pathological anxiety to improve drug development pipelines. The authors therefore compared meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies of induced and pathological anxiety. A systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted in June 2019 for whole-brain functional MRI articles. Eligible articles contrasted either anxious patients to control subjects or an unpredictable-threat condition to a safe condition in healthy participants. Five anxiety disorders were included: posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobia. A total of 3,433 records were identified, 181 articles met selection criteria, and the largest subset of task type was emotional (N=138). Seed-based d-mapping software was used for all analyses. Induced anxiety (N=693 participants) and pathological anxiety (N=2,554 patients and 2,348 control subjects) both showed increased activation in the left and right insula (coordinates, 44, 14, -14 and -38, 20, -8; k=2,102 and k=1,305, respectively) and cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (-12, -8, 68; k=2,217). When the analyses were split by disorder, specific phobia appeared the most, and generalized anxiety disorder the least, similar to induced anxiety. This meta-analysis indicates a consistent pattern of activation across induced and pathological anxiety, supporting the proposition that some neurobiological mechanisms overlap and that the former may be used as a model for the latter. Induced anxiety might nevertheless be a better model for some anxiety disorders than others.

We performed a systematic, quantitative, coordinate-based whole-brain activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comprising 292 MCI and 102 AD patients contrasted to 409 age-matched control subjects. We included episodic encoding and/or retrieval phases, investigated the effects of group, verbal or image stimuli and correlated mean Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores with the modelled activation estimates. MCI patients presented increased right hippocampal activation during memory encoding, decreased activation in the left hippocampus and fusiform gyrus during retrieval tasks, as well as attenuated activation in the right anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus during verbal retrieval. In AD patients, however, stronger activation within the precuneus during encoding tasks was accompanied by attenuated right hippocampal activation during retrieval tasks. Low cognitive performance (MMSE scores) was associated with stronger activation of the precuneus and reduced activation of the right (para)hippocampus and anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. This meta-analysis provides evidence for a specific and probably disease stage-dependent brain activation pattern related to the pathognomonic AD characteristic of episodic memory loss.

It is widely believed that they act mainly through 5HT2A receptors but their effects on neural activation of distinct brain systems are not fully understood. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of brain imaging studies to investigate the effects of substances within this class (e.g., LSD, Psilocybin, DMT, Ayahuasca) in the brain from a molecular and functional point of view. We investigated the question whether the changes in activation patterns and connectivity map into regions with larger 5HT1A/5HT2A receptor binding, as expected from indolaemine hallucinogens (in spite of the often reported emphasis only on 5HT2AR). We did indeed find that regions with changed connectivity and/or activation patterns match regions with high density of 5HT2A receptors, namely visual BA19, visual fusiform regions in BA37, dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and regions involved in theory of mind such as the surpramarginal gyrus, and temporal cortex (rich in 5HT1A receptors). However, we also found relevant patterns in other brain regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, many of the above-mentioned regions also have a significant density of both 5HT1A/5HT2A receptors, and available PET studies on the effects of psychedelics on receptor occupancy are still quite scarce, precluding a metanalytic approach. Finally, we found a robust neuromodulatory effect in the right amygdala. In sum, the available evidence points towards strong neuromodulatory effects of tryptamine psychedelics in key brain regions involved in mental imagery, theory of mind and affective regulation, pointing to potential therapeutic applications of this class of substances.

However, the mechanisms that support non-literal inferences remain debated. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, we evaluate the contribution of linguistic, social-cognitive, and executive mechanisms to non-literal interpretation. We identified 74 fMRI experiments (n\u00a0=\u00a01,430 participants) from 2001 to 2021 that contrasted non-literal language comprehension with a literal control condition, spanning ten phenomena (e.g., metaphor, irony, indirect speech). Applying the activation likelihood estimation approach to the 825 activation peaks yielded six left-lateralized clusters. We then evaluated the locations of both the individual-study peaks and the clusters against probabilistic functional atlases (cf. anatomical locations, as is typically done) for three candidate brain networks-the language-selective network (Fedorenko, Behr, & Kanwisher, 2011), which supports language processing, the Theory of Mind (ToM) network (Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003), which supports social inferences, and the domain-general Multiple-Demand (MD) network (Duncan, 2010), which supports executive control. These atlases were created by overlaying individual activation maps of participants who performed robust and extensively validated 'localizer' tasks that selectively target each network in question (n\u00a0=\u00a0806 for language; n\u00a0=\u00a0198 for ToM; n\u00a0=\u00a0691 for MD). We found that both the individual-study peaks and the ALE clusters fell primarily within the language network and the ToM network. These results suggest that non-literal processing is supported by both i) mechanisms that process literal linguistic meaning, and ii) mechanisms that support general social inference. They thus undermine a strong divide between literal and non-literal aspects of language and challenge the claim that non-literal processing requires additional executive resources.

With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research on relatively small samples, meta-analytic techniques are becoming increasingly important. Here, we aim to clarify the support in fMRI literature for three leading neurobiological models of MDD: limbic-cortical, cortico-striatal and the default mode network. Searches of PubMed and Web of Knowledge, and manual searches, were undertaken in early 2011. Data from 34 case-control comparisons (n=1165) and 6 treatment studies (n=105) were analysed separately with two meta-analytic methods for imaging data: Activation Likelihood Estimation and Gaussian-Process Regression. There was broad support for limbic-cortical and cortico-striatal models in the case-control data. Evidence for the role of the default mode network was weaker. Treatment-sensitive regions were primarily in lateral frontal areas. In any meta-analysis, the increase in the statistical power of the inference comes with the risk of aggregating heterogeneous study pools. While we believe that this wide range of paradigms allows identification of key regions of dysfunction in MDD (regardless of task), we attempted to minimise such risks by employing GPR, which models such heterogeneity. The focus of treatment effects in frontal areas indicates that dysregulation here may represent a biomarker of treatment response. Since the dysregulation in many subcortical regions in the case-control comparisons appeared insensitive to treatment, we propose that these act as trait vulnerability markers, or perhaps treatment insensitivity. Our findings allow these models of MDD to be applied to fMRI literature with some confidence.

In recent years, several neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of guilt, but no meta-analyses have yet identified the most robust activation patterns. A systematic review of literature found 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies with whole-brain analyses meeting the inclusion criteria, for a total of 325 participants and 135 foci of activation. A meta-analysis was then conducted using activation likelihood estimation. Additionally, Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling (MACM) analysis was conducted to investigate the functional connectivity of significant clusters. The analysis revealed 12 significant clusters of brain activation (voxel-based FDR-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05) located in the prefrontal, temporal and parietal regions, mainly in the left hemisphere. Only the left dorsal cingulate cluster survived stringent FWE correction (voxel-based p\u2009<\u20090.05). Secondary analyses (voxel-based FDR-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05) on the 7 studies contrasting guilt with another emotional condition showed an association with clusters in the left precuneus, the anterior cingulate, the left medial frontal gyrus, the right superior frontal gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus. MACM demonstrated that regions associated with guilt are highly interconnected. Our analysis identified a distributed neural network of left-lateralized regions associated with guilt. While voxel-based FDR-corrected results should be considered exploratory, the dorsal cingulate was robustly associated with guilt. We speculate that this network integrates cognitive and emotional processes involved in the experience of guilt, including self-representation, theory of mind, conflict monitoring and moral values. Limitations of our meta-analyses comprise the small sample size and the heterogeneity of included studies, and concerns about naturalistic validity.

This approach has been predominantly applied to studies that focus on whether activation of a brain region is associated with a given psychological process. In a recent paper, we used CBMA to examine a distinct set of studies-that is, those focusing on whether connectivity between brain regions is modulated by a given psychological process (Smith et al. [2016]: Hum Brain Mapp 37:2904-2917). Specifically, we reviewed 284 studies examining brain connectivity with psychophysiological interactions (PPI). Our meta-analytic results indicated that PPI yields connectivity patterns that are consistent across studies and that can be specific for a given psychological process and seed region. After publication of our findings, we learned that the analysis software we used to conduct our CBMAs (GingerALE v2.3.3) contained an implementation error that led to results that were more liberal than intended. Here, we comment on the impact of this implementation error on the results of our paper, new recommendations for sample sizes in CBMAs, and the importance of communication between software users and developers. We show that our key claims are supported in a reanalysis and that our results are robust to new guidelines on sample sizes. Hum Brain Mapp 38:588-591, 2017. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this study was to systematically identify and anatomically localize the evidence for those activation differences across all eligible studies. Fifteen functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) manuscripts, containing 16 samples of 289 unaffected relatives of patients with schizophrenia, and 358 healthy controls were identified that met our inclusion criteria: (1) used a working memory task; and (2) reported standard space coordinates. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) identified convergence across studies. Compared to healthy controls, patients' unaffected relatives showed decreases in neural activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA9), as well as right inferior frontal gyrus (BA44). Increased activation was seen in relatives in the right frontopolar (BA10), left inferior parietal lobe (BA40), and thalamus bilaterally. These results suggest that the familial risk of schizophrenia is expressed in changes in neural activation in the unaffected relatives in the cortical-subcortical working memory network that includes, but is not restricted to the middle prefrontal cortex.

However, inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the central modulatory effects of acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain. The main objective of our investigation has been to obtain comprehensive evidence of acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain diseases. The PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Database, China Biology Medicine disc Database, Clinical Trial Registration Platform, and Wanfang Database were searched for neuroimaging studies on musculoskeletal pain diseases published from inception up to November 2021. Then, the relevant literature was screened to extract the coordinates that meet the criteria. Finally, the coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation algorithm. A total of 15 neuroimaging studies with 183 foci of activation were included in this study. The ALE meta-analysis revealed activated clusters in multiple cortical and sub-cortical brain structures in response to acupuncture across studies, including the thalamus, insula, caudate, claustrum, and lentiform nucleus. The studies showed that acupuncture could modulate different brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, caudate, claustrum, and lentiform nucleus. The findings offer several insights into the potential mechanisms of acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain and provide a possible explanation for the observed clinical benefit of this therapy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=227850, identifier: CRD42021227850.

In adolescents, only working memory could be separable from common EF, whereas in adults, the three EF subcomponents could be separable from common EF.

In contrast, switching showed only domain generality with no activation specialized for either verbal or nonverbal task materials.

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula. This review provides a critical comparison of findings across individual studies and suggests that separate brain regions are involved in different aspects of emotion.

Likewise, smoking cues can trigger craving and relapse in smokers. Brain imaging studies report that structures involved in appetitive behaviors and reward, notably the insula, striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex, tend to be activated by both visual food and smoking cues. Here, by carrying out a meta-analysis of human neuro-imaging studies, we investigate the neural network activated by: 1) food versus neutral cues (14 studies, 142 foci) 2) smoking versus neutral cues (15 studies, 176 foci) 3) smoking versus neutral cues when correlated with craving scores (7 studies, 108 foci). PubMed was used to identify cue-reactivity imaging studies that compared brain response to visual food or smoking cues to neutral cues. Fourteen articles were identified for the food meta-analysis and fifteen articles were identified for the smoking meta-analysis. Six articles were identified for the smoking cue correlated with craving analysis. Meta-analyses were carried out using activation likelihood estimation. Food cues were associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left amygdala, bilateral insula, bilateral orbital frontal cortex, and striatum. Smoking cues were associated with increased BOLD signal in the same areas, with the exception of the insula. However, the smoking meta-analysis of brain maps correlating cue-reactivity with subjective craving did identify the insula, suggesting that insula activation is only found when craving levels are high. The brain areas identified here are involved in learning, memory and motivation, and their cue-induced activity is an index of the incentive salience of the cues. Using meta-analytic techniques to combine a series of studies, we found that food and smoking cues activate comparable brain networks. There is significant overlap in brain regions responding to conditioned cues associated with natural and drug rewards.

Old/new (hit > CR) effects associated most consistently with (1) components of the default-mode network, including the left angular gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and bilateral posterior cingulate regions, which may support the mental re-experiencing of an old event, or ecphory; (2) components of the cognitive-control network, involving the left dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and bilateral intraparietal sulcus regions, which may mediate memory and non-memory control functions; and (3) the caudate nucleus, a key part of the brain's reward system that may support the satisfaction tied to target-detection. Direct comparisons of old/new effects between item versus source retrieval and \"remember\" versus \"know\" retrieval yielded three main sets of findings. First, default-mode network regions showed greater old/new effects in conditions associated with richer ecphoric processing. Second, cognitive-control network regions showed greater old/new effects in conditions associated with a greater demand for strategic-retrieval processing. Third, the caudate nucleus showed greater old/new effects in conditions tied to greater confidence in target-detection. New/old (CR > hit) effects most strongly associated with the bilateral medial temporal lobe, possibly reflecting greater encoding-related activity for new than for old items, and the right posterior middle temporal regions, possibly reflecting repetition-related neural priming for old items. In conclusion, neural activity distinguishing old from new events comprises an ensemble of multiple memory-specific activities, including encoding, retrieval, and priming, as well as multiple types of more general cognitive activities, including default-mode, cognitive-control, and reward processing.

We report findings that suggest: (i) several organizational principles of the ventral stream, including a gradient of pattern granulation and an increasing abstraction of neural representations as one proceeds anteriorly; (ii) how methodological choices affect decoding strength. The data also show that studies with stronger decoding performance tend to be reported in higher-impact journals, by authors with a higher h-index.

A wealth of neuroimaging data suggest that weight gain might be related to aberrant brain function, particularly in prefrontal cortical regions modulating mesolimbic addictive responses to food. Nevertheless, food addiction is currently a model hotly debated. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, examining the most common functional differences between normal-weight and obese participants in response to food stimuli. We conducted a search using several journal databases and adhered to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses' (PRISMA) method. To this aim, 10 studies were found with a total of 126 obese participants, 129 healthy controls, equaling 184 foci (146 increased, 38 decreased activation) using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) technique. Out of the 10 studies, 7 investigated neural responses to food versus non-food images. In response to food images, obese in comparison to healthy weight subjects had increased activation in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex, and reduced activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left insular cortex. Prefrontal cortex areas linked to cognitive evaluation processes, such as evaluation of rewarding stimuli, as well as explicit memory regions, appear most consistently activated in response to images of food in those who are obese. Conversely, a reduced activation in brain regions associated with cognitive control and interoceptive awareness of sensations in the body might indicate a weakened control system, combined with hypo-sensitivity to satiety and discomfort signals after eating in those who are prone to overeat.

The major results were as follows. First, the Hit\u00a0>\u00a0Miss contrast mainly involved regions in the default mode network (DMN)/medial temporal lobe (MTL), likely reflecting a greater amount of retrieved information during the Hit than Miss trials. Second, the Intact\u00a0>\u00a0Rearranged contrast mainly involved regions in the DMN/MTL, supporting the view that rejecting recombination foils is based on familiarity with the component parts in the absence of recollection. Third, the Memory\u00a0>\u00a0Perception contrast primarily involved regions in the frontoparietal control network, likely reflecting the greater demands on controlled processing during Memory than Perception conditions. Fourth, the subcortical clusters included the amygdala, caudate nucleus/putamen, and mediodorsal thalamus regions, suggesting that these regions are components of the neural circuits supporting associative recollection. Finally, comparisons with previous meta-analyses suggested that associative recollection involves the DMN regions more strongly than source recollection but less strongly than subjective recollection.

An fMRI based quantitative meta-analysis.\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\nWhilst recent neuroimaging studies have identified a series of different brain regions as being involved in empathy, it remains unclear concerning the activation consistence of these brain regions and their specific functional roles. Using MKDA, a whole-brain based quantitative meta-analysis of recent fMRI studies of empathy was performed. This analysis identified the dACC-aMCC-SMA and bilateral anterior insula as being consistently activated in empathy. Hypothesizing that what are here termed affective-perceptual and cognitive-evaluative forms of empathy might be characterized by different activity patterns, the neural activations in these forms of empathy were compared. The dorsal aMCC was demonstrated to be recruited more frequently in the cognitive-evaluative form of empathy, whilst the right anterior insula was found to be involved in the affective-perceptual form of empathy only.

However, the inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the exact neuropathology related to MDD. The current meta-analysis used state-of-the-art conjunction analysis techniques to systematically review and summarize all available neuroimaging studies using rs-fMRI with amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and/or fractional ALFF (fALFF) on MDD patients and further explored the effect of antidepressants on the intrinsic activity of the brain. The anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was applied to investigate changes in ALFF/fALFF in depression. We performed a subgroup analysis and group comparison on medicated and drug na\u00efve patients to detect drug effect on MDD patients and conjunction analysis to identify congruent results between the two methods. Meta-regression was used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics. Adult MDD patients showed a robust increase in intrinsic activity in the resting state in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in both ALFF (P<0.001) and fALFF (P<0.01) studies. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the increased activity in the ACC was prominent in medicated patients only and not seen in drug-na\u00efve MDD patients, while medication-na\u00efve patients showed a specific decreased activity in the cerebellum (P<0.01). Group comparison showed that the intrinsic ACC activity is elevated in medicated MDD patients compared with drug na\u00efve MDD patients. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the increased ACC activation was positively correlated with illness duration (P<0.001). Our findings suggest that increased activity of the ACC is more likely to be associated with antidepressant treatment, while decreased intrinsic activity of the cerebellum might be a specific biomarker for current MDD.

As these mental activities provide the proximate mechanisms for social behaviours, it becomes essential to understand the neural activity underlying differences between own-race and other-race visual categorization. Yet intrinsic limitations of individual neuroimaging studies, owing to reduced sample size, inclusion of multiple races, and interactions between races in the participants and in the displayed visual stimuli, dampens generalizability of results. In the present meta-analytic study, we applied multimodal techniques to partly overcome these hurdles, and we investigated the entire functional neuroimaging literature on race categorization, therefore including more than 2000 Black, White and Asian participants. Our data-driven approach shows that own- and other-race visual categorization involves partly segregated neural networks, with distinct connectivity and functional profiles, and defined hierarchical organization. Categorization of own-race mainly engages areas related to cognitive components of empathy and mentalizing, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus. These areas are functionally co-activated with cortical structures involved in auto-biographical memories and social knowledge. Conversely, other-race categorization recruits areas implicated in, and functionally connected with, visuo-attentive processing, like the fusiform gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule, and areas engaged in affective functions, like the amygdala. These results contribute to a better definition of the neural networks involved in the visual parcelling of social categories based on race, and help to situate these processes within a common neural space.

We sought to determine if there are brain areas that consistently show either hyper- or hypo-activation in people treated with chemotherapy for non-CNS cancer (Chemo+). Using activation likelihood estimation on brain coordinates from 14 fMRI studies yielding 25 contrasts from 375 Chemo+ and 429 chemotherapy-naive controls while they performed cognitive tasks, the meta-analysis yielded two significant clusters which are part of the frontoparietal attention network, both showing lower activation in Chemo+. One cluster peaked in the left superior parietal cortex, extending into precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and angular gyrus. The other peaked in the right superior prefrontal areas, extending into inferior prefrontal cortex. We propose that these observed lower activations reflect a dysfunction in mobilizing and/or sustaining attention due to depletion of cognitive resources. This could explain higher level of mental fatigue reported by Chemo+ and why cancer survivors report problems in a wide variety of cognitive domains.

Numerous studies have reported the role of the insula in evaluating these dimensions of taste; however, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, in the current study, we performed meta-analyses of published data to identify locations consistently activated across studies and evaluate whether different regions of the human brain could be responsible for processing different dimensions of taste. Meta-analyses were performed on 39 experiments, with 846 total healthy subjects (without psychiatric/neurological disorders) in 34 studies reporting whole-brain results. The aim was to establish the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of taste-mediated regional activation across the whole brain. Apart from one meta-analysis for all studies in general, three analyses were performed to reveal the clusters of activation that were attributable to processing the affective value (data from 323 foci), intensity (data from 43 foci) and quality (data from 45 foci) of taste. The ALE revealed eight clusters of activation outside the insula for processing affective value, covering the middle and posterior cingulate, pre-/post-central gyrus, caudate and thalamus. The affective value had four clusters of activation (two in each hemisphere) in the insula. The intensity and quality activated only the insula, each with one cluster on the right. The concurrence between studies was moderate; at best, 53% of the experiments contributed to the significant clusters attributable to the affective value, 60% to intensity and 50% to quality. The affective value was processed bilaterally in the anterior to middle insula, whereas intensity was processed in the right antero-middle insula, and quality was processed in the right middle insula. The right middle dorsal insula was responsible for processing both the affective value and quality of taste. The exploratory analysis on taste quality did not have a significant result if the studies using liquid food stimuli were excluded. Results from the meta-analyses on studies involving the oral delivery of liquid tastants or liquid food stimuli confirmed that the insula is involved in processing all three dimensions of taste. More experimental studies are required to investigate whether brain activations differ between liquid tastants and food. The coordinates of activated brain areas and brain maps are provided to serve as references for future taste/food studies.

Surprisingly, few functional imaging studies exploring human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal function exist, and results are to some degree inconsistent. We utilized activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis tool, to analyze functional imaging data (fMRI/PET) following intranasal trigeminal stimulation with carbon dioxide (CO(2)), a stimulus known to exclusively activate the trigeminal system. Meta-analysis tools are able to identify activations common across studies, thereby enabling activation mapping with higher certainty. Activation foci of nine studies utilizing trigeminal stimulation were included in the meta-analysis. We found significant ALE scores, thus indicating consistent activation across studies, in the brainstem, ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, precentral gyrus, as well as in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices-a network known for the processing of intranasal nociceptive stimuli. Significant ALE values were also observed in the piriform cortex, insula, and the orbitofrontal cortex, areas known to process chemosensory stimuli, and in association cortices. Additionally, the trigeminal ALE statistics were directly compared with ALE statistics originating from olfactory stimulation, demonstrating considerable overlap in activation. In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis map the human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal stimulation with high statistical certainty and demonstrate that the cortical areas recruited during the processing of intranasal CO(2) stimuli include those outside traditional trigeminal areas. Moreover, through illustrations of the considerable overlap between brain areas that process trigeminal and olfactory information; these results demonstrate the interconnectivity of flavor processing.

Activation of amygdala can be associated with modulation of behavioral response to subjectively significant stimuli. A more ventral part of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can be associated with self-referential reasoning about ingroup members while a more dorsal part of ACC is involved in the regulation of emotions toward outgroup members. Right insula can be engaged in the modulation of outgroup avoidance behavior.

However, the primary literature is composed of small-to-medium-sized studies, using diverse activation paradigms on variously characterized patient groups, which can be difficult to synthesize into a coherent account. This review aimed to synthesize current evidence from fMRI studies in midlife adults with BD and to investigate whether there is support for the theoretical models of the disorder. We used voxel-based quantitative meta-analytic methods to combine primary data on anatomical coordinates of activation from 65 fMRI studies comparing normal volunteers (n = 1,074) and patients with BD (n = 1,040). Compared to normal volunteers, patients with BD underactivated the inferior frontal cortex (IFG) and putamen and overactivated limbic areas, including medial temporal structures (parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and amygdala) and basal ganglia. Dividing studies into those using emotional and cognitive paradigms demonstrated that the IFG abnormalities were manifest during both cognitive and emotional processing, while increased limbic activation was mainly related to emotional processing. In further separate comparisons between healthy volunteers and patient subgroups in each clinical state, the IFG was underactive in manic but not in euthymic and depressed states. Limbic structures were not overactive in association with mood states, with the exception of increased amygdala activation in euthymic states when including region-of-interest studies. In summary, our results showed abnormal frontal-limbic activation in BD. There was attenuated activation of the IFG or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which was consistent across emotional and cognitive tasks and particularly related to the state of mania, and enhanced limbic activation, which was elicited by emotional and not cognitive tasks, and not clearly related to mood states.

Next, we generated functional preference profiles by using multivariate classification to identify the psychological states that best predicted activity within each cluster. We observed large functional differences between networks, suggesting brain networks support distinct modes of processing. Within each network, however, we observed relatively low functional specificity, suggesting discrete psychological states are not strongly localized to individual regions; instead, our results are consistent with the view that individual LFC regions work as part of distributed networks to give rise to flexible behavior.

It is worth noting that explicit and implicit fear processing produces different behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. The present study capitalizes on the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method of meta-analysis to identify: (a) the \"core\" network of fear processing in healthy individuals; (b) common and specific neural activations associated with explicit and implicit processing of fear. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 92 fMRI and PET studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall analysis show that the core fear network comprises the amygdala, pulvinar, and fronto-occipital regions. Both implicit and explicit fear processing activated amygdala, declive, fusiform gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that these two types of fear processing share a common neural substrate. Explicit fear processing elicited more activations at the pulvinar and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting visual attention/orientation and contextual association play important roles during explicit fear processing. In contrast, implicit fear processing elicited more activations at the cerebellum-amygdala-cortical pathway, indicating an 'alarm' system underlying implicit fear processing.

In this method, a localization probability distribution was modeled for each activation focus obtained from 11 PET studies of reading single words aloud, and the union of these distributions was taken to yield an activation likelihood estimate map for the brain. Significance was assessed via permutation analysis of randomly generated sets of foci. Regions of significant concordance were identified in bilateral motor and superior temporal cortices, pre-SMA, left fusiform gyrus, and the cerebellum. These meta-analytic results were validated by comparison with new fMRI data on aloud word reading in normal adult subjects. Excellent correspondence between the two statistical maps was observed, with fMRI maxima lying close to all meta-analysis peaks and statistical values at the peaks identified by the two techniques correlating strongly. This close correspondence between PET meta-analysis and fMRI results also demonstrates the validity of using fMRI for the study of language tasks involving overt speech responses. Advantages of this automated meta-analysis technique include quantification of the level of concordance at all brain locations and the provision for use of a threshold for statistical significance of concordance.

A number of neuropsychological and experimental studies have investigated this effect, yet results in the field remain mixed, as there is a lack of consensus regarding the neural correlates thought to support memory-guided attention. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify a common set of brain structures involved in memory-guided attention. Statistical analyses were computed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that presented participants with a task that required them to detect a target or a change embedded in repeated and novel complex visual displays. After a systematic search, 10 fMRI studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. The results yielded four significant clusters. Activity in right inferior parietal (Brodmann area [BA] 9) and right superior parietal (BA 7) lobes suggests involvement of a fronto-parietal attention network, while activity in left mid-cingulate cortex (BA 23) and right middle frontal gyrus (BA 10) suggests involvement of a fronto-parietal control network. These findings are consistent with the notion that fronto-parietal circuits are important for interfacing retrieved memories with attentional systems to guide search.

However, no studies to date have systemically reviewed fMRI studies of GD to analyze the brain areas activated by gambling-related cues and examine whether these areas were differentially activated between cases and healthy controls (HC). This study reviewed 62 candidate articles and ultimately selected 13 qualified voxel-wise whole brain analysis studies to perform a comprehensive series of meta-analyses using the effect size-signed differential mapping approach. Compared with HC, GD patients showed significant activation in right lentiform nucleus and left middle occipital gyrus. The increased activities in the lentiform nucleus compared to HC were also found in both GD subgroups, regardless of excluding or not excluding any kind of substance use disorder. In addition, the South Oaks Gambling Screen scores were associated with hyperactivity in right lentiform nucleus and bilateral parahippocampus, but negatively related to right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest dysfunction within the frontostriatal cortical pathway in GD, which could contribute to our understanding of the categories and definition of GD and provide evidence for the reclassification of GD as a behavioral addiction in the DSM-5.

The analysis was also extended to structures related to affective empathy (insula, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex) and to two more emotional processing areas (orbitofrontal cortex and fusiform gyrus). Hypoactivation was more frequently observed in regions of the mirror neuron system from people with high psychopathic traits, as well as in the emotional processing structures, and those associated with affective empathy, except for the insula, where it presented higher activity.

Compared to controls, patients with MCI displayed convergent reduced regional GMV and altered intrinsic activity, mainly in the default mode network and salience network. Decreased GMV alone in ventral medial prefrontal cortex and altered intrinsic function alone in bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, right lingual gyrus, and cerebellum were identified, respectively.

To promote more effective research, we propose a taxonomy of distancing within the broader context of emotion regulation strategies; review the effects of this tactic; and offer a preliminary neurocognitive model describing key cognitive processes and their neural bases. Our model emphasizes three components-self-projection, affective self-reflection, and cognitive control. Additionally, we present results from a supporting meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of distancing.

Semantic dementia patients show a progressive and a specific semantic impairment, following bilateral atrophy of the ATLs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy participants, however, do not consistently show ATL activation during semantic tasks. Consequently, several influential theories of semantic memory do not ascribe a central role to the ATLs. We conducted a meta-analysis of 164 functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing to investigate factors that might contribute to the inconsistency in previous results. Four factors influenced the likelihood of finding ATL activation: (1) the use of PET versus fMRI, reflecting the fact that fMRI but not PET is sensitive to distortion artifacts caused by large variations in magnetic susceptibility in the area of the ATL; (2) a field of view (FOV) of more than 15 cm, thereby ensuring whole-brain coverage; (3) the use of a high baseline task to prevent subtraction of otherwise uncontrolled semantic activation; (4) the inclusion of the ATL as an ROI. The type of stimuli or task did not influence the likelihood of ATL activation, consistent with the view that this region underpins an amodal semantic system. Spoken words, written words, and picture stimuli produced overlapping ATL peaks. On average, these were more inferior for picture-based tasks. We suggest that the specific pattern of ATL activation may be influenced by stimulus type due to variations across this region in the degree of connectivity with modality-specific areas in posterior temporal cortex.

However, due to the differences in study design, these previous findings are inconsistent, and the underlying neuropathological characteristics of FD remain unclear. Eight databases were systematically searched for literature from inception to October 2022 with the keywords \"Functional dyspepsia\" and \"Neuroimaging.\" Thereafter, the anisotropic effect size signed the differential mapping (AES-SDM) approach that was applied to meta-analyze the aberrant brain activity pattern of FD patients. A total of 11 articles with 260 FD patients and 202 healthy controls (HCs) were included. The AES-SDM meta-analysis demonstrated that FD patients manifested increased activity in the bilateral insula, left anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral thalamus, right precentral gyrus, left supplementary motor area, right putamen, and left rectus gyrus and decreased functional activity in the right cerebellum compared to the HCs. Sensitivity analysis showed that all these above regions were highly reproducible, and no significant publication bias was detected. The current study demonstrated that FD patients had significantly abnormal activity patterns in several brain regions involved in visceral sensation perception, pain modulation, and emotion regulation, which provided an integrated insight into the neuropathological characteristics of FD.

Given that emotion dysregulation is central to bipolar disorder, this study hypothesizes that emotional circuitry regions are altered along with anomalies in the attentional systems during cognitive deployment in bipolar disorder. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of attentional activities using GingerALE software was completed for adult and pediatric bipolar disorder populations in all published studies till December 2017. The meta-analysis of all fMRI studies included a total of ten pediatric studies (comprised of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and typically developing (TD) groups) and nine adult patient studies (comprised of adult bipolar disorder (ABD) and healthy control (HC) groups). While engaged in attentional tasks, increased activation was seen in inferior frontal gyrus with decreased activation in limbic regions in subjects with PBD, relative to TD. Differential patterns of underactivity were also noted in the dorsal attentional system i.e., frontostriatal circuit (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, right lentiform nucleus and right globus pallidus) in PBD patients relative to the TD. However, we did not see any significant differences between the adult groups i.e., ABD vs. HC. In PBD, deploying attentional system potentially improves the fronto-limbic affective circuitry function, despite impaired dorsal attentional system i.e., fronto-striatal circuitry. In contrast, these neural correlates underlying attentional engagement appeared to be not significant in adult BD. We examined the PBD vs. TD and the ABD vs. HC separately instead of four-way contrast (dual meta-analytic study). Also, attentional tasks were not unidimensional and tend to capture selective and sustained attention along with response inhibition, thereby recruiting multiple brain circuits.

We hypothesized that older adults would show a greater likelihood of activation in right cortical motor areas (i.e., ipsilateral to the side of movement) compared to young adults. ALE maps were examined for conjunction and between-group differences. Older adults showed overlapping likelihoods of activation with young adults in left primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral insula, left thalamus, and right anterior cerebellum. Their ALE map differed from that of the young adults in right SM1 (extending into dorsal premotor cortex), right supramarginal gyrus, medial premotor cortex, and right posterior cerebellum. The finding that older adults uniquely use ipsilateral regions for right-hand finger movements and show age-dependent modulations in regions recruited by both age groups provides a foundation by which to understand age-related motor decline and motor disorders.

The aim of the present review is to provide a review across wide range of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to critically identify the cortical networks associated with passionate love, and to compare and contrast it with other types of love (such as maternal love and unconditional love for persons with intellectual disabilities). Retrospective review of pertinent neuroimaging literature. Review of published literature on fMRI studies of love illustrating brain regions associated with different forms of love. Although all fMRI studies of love point to the subcortical dopaminergic reward-related brain systems (involving dopamine and oxytocin receptors) for motivating individuals in pair-bonding, the present meta-analysis newly demonstrated that different types of love involve distinct cerebral networks, including those for higher cognitive functions such as social cognition and bodily self-representation. These metaresults provide the first stages of a global neuroanatomical model of cortical networks involved in emotions related to different aspects of love. Developing this model in future studies should be helpful for advancing clinical approaches helpful in sexual medicine and couple therapy.

The RPE signal has been hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations). Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE, locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first valence network (negative\u2009>\u2009positive) involved areas regulating alertness and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence network (positive\u2009>\u2009negative) encompassed regions of the human reward circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially distinct functional roles.

Numerous imaging studies have demonstrated brain changes in schizophrenia, particularly aberrant intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of ongoing brain activity, measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and aberrant gray matter volume (GMV) of distributed brain regions, measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging. It is unclear, however, which iFC changes are specific to schizophrenia compared with those of other disorders and whether such specific iFC changes converge with GMV changes. To address this question of specific substantial dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, we performed a transdiagnostic multimodal meta-analysis of resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Multiple databases were searched up to June 2017 for whole-brain seed-based iFC studies and voxel-based morphometry studies in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, addiction, and anxiety. Coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed to detect 1) schizophrenia-specific hyperconnectivity or hypoconnectivity of intrinsic brain networks (compared with hyperconnectivity or hypoconnectivity of each other disorder both separately and combined across comparisons) and 2) the overlap between dysconnectivity and GMV changes (via multimodal conjunction analysis). For iFC meta-analysis, 173 publications comprising 4962 patients and 4575 control subjects were included, and for GMV meta-analysis, 127 publications comprising 6311 patients and 6745 control subjects were included. Disorder-specific iFC dysconnectivity in schizophrenia (consistent across comparisons with other disorders) was found for limbic, frontoparietal executive, default mode, and salience networks. Disorder-specific dysconnectivity and GMV reductions converged in insula, lateral postcentral cortex, striatum, and thalamus. Results demonstrated specific substantial dysconnectivity in schizophrenia in insula, lateral postcentral cortex, striatum, and thalamus. Data suggest that these regions are characteristic targets of schizophrenia.

The AM network is a distributed brain network comprised largely by prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortical brain regions, which together facilitate AM. Autobiographical memories with high arousal and negatively valenced emotional states are thought to be retrieved more readily and re-experienced more vividly. This is critical in the case of trauma-related AMs, which are related to altered phenomenological experiences as well as aberrations to the underlying neural systems in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Critically, these alterations to the AM network have not been explored recently and have never been analyzed with consideration to the different processes of AM, them being retrieval and re-experiencing. We conducted a series of effect-size signed differential mapping meta-analyses across twenty-eight studies investigating the neural correlates of trauma-related AMs in participants with PTSD as compared with controls. Studies included either trauma-related scripts or trauma-related materials (i.e., sounds, images, pictures) implemented to evoke the recollection of a trauma-related memory. The meta-analyses revealed that control and PTSD participants displayed greater common brain activation of prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortices, respectively. Whereby the prefrontal medial cortices are suggested to facilitate retrieval monitoring, the posteromedial cortices are thought to enable the visual imagery processes of AM. Taken together, reduced common activation of prefrontal cortices may be interpreted as a bias toward greater re-experiencing, where the more salient elements of the traumatic memory are relived as opposed to retrieved in a controlled manner in PTSD.

These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, replicating results in animals, or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena. It has remained difficult, however, to synthesize these findings into a systems neuroscience account of how networks across the whole-brain support the enhancing effects of emotion on memory encoding. To this end, the present study employed a meta-analytic approach using activation likelihood estimates to assess the anatomical specificity and reliability of event-related fMRI activations related to successful memory encoding for emotional versus neutral information. The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala, anterior hippocampus, anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the ventral visual stream, left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex. The results within the amygdala and MTL support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects. The consistency of findings in cortical targets, including the visual, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, underscores the importance of generating hypotheses regarding their participation in emotional memory formation. In particular, we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing, semantic elaboration, and attention, which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material. These findings may motivate future research on emotional modulation of widespread neural systems and the implications of this modulation for cognition.

Moreover, regions that have been previously implicated in value integration in other cost domains, such as the vmPFC and ventral striatum, were consistently involved in signaling net value. The opposite response patterns of the pre-SMA and vmPFC imply that they are differentially involved in the representation of effort costs and value integration. These findings provide conclusive evidence that the vmPFC is a central node for net value computation and reveal potential brain targets to treat motivation-related disorders.

However, high levels of aggression can lead to the violation of social and legal norms. Understanding brain function in individuals with high levels of aggression as they process anger- and aggression-eliciting stimuli is critical for refining explanatory models of aggression and thereby improving interventions. Three neurobiological models of reactive aggression - the limbic hyperactivity, prefrontal hypoactivity, and dysregulated limbic-prefrontal connectivity models - have been proposed. However, these models are based on neuroimaging studies involving mainly non-aggressive individuals, leaving it unclear which model best describes brain function in those with a history of aggression. We conducted a systematic literature search (PubMed and Psycinfo) and Multilevel Kernel Density meta-analysis (MKDA) of nine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (eight included in the between-group analysis [i.e., aggression vs. control groups], five in the within-group analysis). Studies examined brain responses to tasks putatively eliciting anger and aggression in individuals with a history of aggression alone and relative to controls. Individuals with a history of aggression exhibited greater activity in the superior temporal gyrus and in regions comprising the cognitive control and default mode networks (right posterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus) during reactive aggression relative to baseline conditions. Compared to controls, individuals with a history of aggression exhibited increased activity in limbic regions (left hippocampus, left amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus) and temporal regions (superior, middle, inferior temporal gyrus), and reduced activity in occipital regions (left occipital cortex, left calcarine cortex). These findings lend support to the limbic hyperactivity model in individuals with a history of aggression, and further indicate altered temporal and occipital activity in anger- and aggression-eliciting conditions involving face and speech processing.

We aimed to determine, via meta-analysis, agreement between the two tests and identify predictors of disagreement. We performed a systematic search for studies comparing WT and fMRI for memory lateralization with individual-patient data. If results were provided as laterality indexes instead of hemispheric lateralization, the cutoff point for memory lateralization was set to the usual \u00b12 for WT and \u00b10.20 for fMRI. We also evaluated results at our Epilepsy Center. Seven published series plus our own were included, comprising 124 patients. Wada test was performed by recognizing objects in half of the studies, and scenes, drawings, and words in the rest. All used scenes or pictures encoding for fMRI. Wada test-fMRI agreement across the studies ranged from 21.1 to 100%, averaging 46.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.6-56.0%). When cases with bilateral memory in either test were excluded, agreement reached 78.7% (95% CI: 67.6-89.8%), and concordance with contralateral TLE foci 86.4% for the WT and 83.0% for fMRI. Higher agreement was associated with using multiple items during WT (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and higher disagreement with presence of a lesion on MRI (p\u202f=\u202f0.024). Binary logistic regression confirmed use of multiple items on WT as the strongest predictor of agreement (odds ratio [OR]: 6.95, 95% CI: 1.84-26.22; p\u202f=\u202f0.004) and a bilateral result on the WT or fMRI of disagreement (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.89 and OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.45; p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

However, convergent quantitative evidence on the neural network explaining how aggression arises is still lacking. To address this gap, peak activations extracted from extant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were synthesized through coordinate-based meta-analyses. A systematic search in the PubMed database was conducted and 26 fMRI studies met the inclusion criteria. Three separate activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were performed on (1) individual differences in trait aggression (TA) studies, (2) individual differences in TA studies examining executive functioning, and (3) elicited aggression (EA) studies across fMRI behavioral paradigms. Ensuing clusters from ALE meta-analyses were further treated as seeds for follow-up investigations on consensus connectivity networks (CCN) delineated from meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to further characterize their physiological functions. Finally, we obtained a data-driven functional characterization of the ensuing clusters and their networks. This approach offers a boarder view of the ensuing clusters using a boarder network perspective. In TA, aberrant brain activations were found only in the right precuneus. Follow-up analyses revealed that the precuneus seed was within the frontal-parietal network (FPN) associated with action inhibition, visuospatial processing and higher-level cognition. With further restricting to only experiments examining executive functioning, convergent evidence was found in the right rolandic operculum (RO), midcingulate cortex (MCC), precentral gyrus (PrG) and precuneus. Follow-up analyses suggested that RO, MCC and PrG may belong to a common cognitive control network, while the MCC seems to be the hub of this network. In EA, we only revealed a convergent region in the left postcentral gyrus. Follow-up CCN analyses and functional characterizations suggested that this region may also belong to the same cognitive control network found in the TA sub-analysis. Our results suggested that escalated aggression arises from abnormal precuneus activities within the FPN, disrupting the recruitment of other large-scale networks such as adaptive cognitive control network. Consequently, failure to recruit such a network results in an inability to generate adaptive responses, increasing the likelihood of acting aggressively.

Studies on VS-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with VS activation during reward processing. Against the background that ADHD may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. We discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the \"unrelated model\".

However, in addition to evaluate the presence and severity of IPS impairment, it is of interest to determine the localization and integration of brain regions responsible for the functions assessed by the SDMT. To review the studies that adapted the SDMT to the magnetic resonance environment and obtain the brain areas associated with the performance of the task in healthy subjects with a meta-analysis. A systematic review was performed using ten studies published between 1990 and 2017, and selected from four databases. All studies included participants of both genders and age between 18 and 50 years, used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and SDMT adaptation and reported brain regions associated with the task. Six of them also reported the region coordinates in a standard space, so they were included in a meta-analysis. Activation Likelihood Estimation algorithm, with significance for p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons, was used to identify areas that are robustly related to the performance of the SDMT. The areas predominantly reported in the studies of our meta-analysis were regions of the frontoparietal attentional network and occipital cortex, as well as cuneus, precuneus, and cerebellum. Individually all regions that survived the statistical threshold are consistent with what is expected after reviewing prospective studies. The present study allowed the identification of brain areas activated during the performance of the SDMT in healthy subjects, and therefore it will help understanding the differences in brain activation by this task in clinical populations. Moreover, it may guide future studies of therapeutic strategies and interventions in those populations.

In this study, we used two different meta-analytic algorithms, Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) & Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to quantitatively assess the neural correlates of IF and to evaluate the degree of compatibility between the proposed neurobiological models and the existing brain imaging data. We found that IF involves the interaction of two networks, the main \"core regions\" consisting of a primarily right-lateralized frontal-parietal circuit that is activated irrespective of the paradigm used and sample characteristics and a second less constrained \"supportive network\" that involves frontal-hippocampal interactions when IF takes place. Additionally, our results support the validity of the inhibitory or thought suppression hypothesis. The presence of a neural signature of IF that is stable regardless of experimental paradigms is a promising finding that may open new venues for the development of effective clinical interventions.

To improve the characterization of emotion processing and investigate how attention allocation impacts this processing, we conducted a meta-analysis on task activation foci using GingerALE software. Eighty human neuroimaging studies of emotion including 2761 participants identified through Web of Science and ProQuest databases were analyzed collectively and then divided into two categories based on the focus of attention during the task: explicit or implicit emotion processing. The results examining the explicit emotion tasks identified clusters within the posterior cerebellar hemispheres (bilateral lobule VI/Crus I/II), the vermis, and left lobule V/VI that were likely to be activated across studies, while implicit tasks activated clusters including bilateral lobules VI/Crus I/II, right Crus II/lobule VIII, anterior lobule VI, and lobules I-IV/V. A direct comparison between these categories revealed five overlapping clusters in right lobules VI/Crus I/Crus II and left lobules V/VI/Crus I of the cerebellum common to both the explicit and implicit task contrasts. There were also three clusters activated significantly more for explicit emotion tasks compared to implicit tasks (right lobule VI, left lobule VI/vermis), and one cluster activated more for implicit than explicit tasks (left lobule VI). These findings support previous studies indicating affective processing activates both the lateral hemispheric lobules and the vermis of the cerebellum. The common and distinct activation of posterior cerebellar regions by tasks with explicit and implicit attention demonstrates the supportive role of this structure in recognizing, appraising, and reacting to emotional stimuli.

Whether studies consistently identify similar brain loci engaged in these movements remains unknown. We investigated the consistency with which specific brain loci were reported to be activated during teeth-occluding movements, using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Twenty fMRI studies that used fMRI to investigate brain activation during a chewing or clenching task in healthy participants were included. Data from the selected studies were pooled, and ALE methods were used to estimate the likelihood of finding a locus associated with the movements. We found that (i) The bilateral primary motor cortex/supplementary motor area/thalamus, the right primary somatosensory cortex (S1)/secondary somatosensory cortex and the posterior cerebellum (lobule VI) have been identified as reliable loci that show consistently activation when teeth occlude. (ii) The right S1 showed a significant likelihood of activation associated with both chewing and clenching, while the left S1 showed a greater likelihood of activation in chewing than in clenching. (iii) Both younger and older participants showed a significant likelihood of activation in the cerebellum. No significant cluster was identified in the contrast analysis. The fMRI studies reliably identified the sensorimotor cortex, the thalamus and the cerebellum as brain loci associated with chewing and clenching and illustrated a differential activation pattern between chewing and clenching. These findings support the use of fMRI as a potential tool for assessing brain activation patterns related to oral sensorimotor functions in humans.

One possibility for this inconsistency is that reasoning is such an intricate cognitive process, involving attention, memory, executive functions, symbolic processing, and fluid intelligence, whereby various brain regions are inevitably implicated in orchestrating the process. Therefore, researchers have used meta-analyses for a better understanding of neural mechanisms of reasoning. However, previous meta-analysis techniques include weaknesses such as an inadequate representation of the cortical surface's highly folded geometry. Accordingly, we developed a new meta-analysis method called Bayesian meta-analysis of the cortical surface (BMACS). BMACS offers a fast, accurate, and accessible inference of the spatial patterns of cognitive processes from peak brain activations across studies by applying spatial point processes to the cortical surface. Using BMACS, we found that the common pattern of activations from inductive and deductive reasoning was colocalized with the multiple-demand system, indicating that reasoning is a high-level convergence of complex cognitive processes. We hope surface-based meta-analysis will be facilitated by BMACS, bringing more profound knowledge of various cognitive processes.

We divided the existing experimental paradigms into 3 categories: game-related cue-reactivity, executive control, and risk-reward-related decision-making tasks. We divided all studies into three subgroups according to their paradigms. In cue-reactivity tasks, patients with IGD exhibited significant hyperactivation in the bilateral precuneus and bilateral cingulate and significant hypoactivation in the insula, but there were no differences in the striatum. In executive control tasks, patients with IGD displayed significant hyperactivation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, bilateral cingulate, and insula and hypoactivation in the left inferior frontal gyrus. In risky decision-making paradigms, IGD patients exhibited significant hyperactivation in the left striatum, right inferior frontal gyrus, and insula and hypoactivation in the left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Our study aimed to discover the similarities among all studies and to explore the uniqueness of the different paradigms. This study further confirmed the critical role of reward circuitry and executive control circuitry in IGD but not under all conditions.

Although previous studies suggested that the basalo-cortical projection system influences various cognitive functions, particularly via its cholinergic component, these studies only focused on certain parts of the BFcs or nearby structures, leaving aside a more systematic picture of the functional connectivity of BFcs subcompartments. Moreover, these studies lacked the high-spatial resolution and the probability maps needed to identify specific subcompartments. Recent advances in the ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided potentially unprecedented spatial resolution of functional MRI images to study the subdivision of the BFcs. In this study, the BF space containing corticopetal cells was divided into 3 functionally distinct subdivisions based on functional connection to cortical regions derived from fMRI. The overall functional connection of each BFcs subdivision was examined with a test-retest study. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to study the related functional topics of each BF subdivision. Our results demonstrate distinct functional connectivity patterns of these subdivisions along the rostrocaudal axis of the BF. All three compartments have shown consistent segregation and overlap at specific target regions including the hippocampus, insula, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus, suggesting functional integration and separation in BFcs.

Main meta-analysis indicated that patients with chronic schizophrenia demonstrated attenuated activations in limbic emotional system along with compensatory over-activation in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during threatening faces processing. Sub-task analyses revealed under-activations in right amygdala and left fusiform gyrus in both implicit and explicit tasks. The remaining clusters were found to be differently involved in different types of tasks. Moreover, meta-regression analyses showed brain abnormalities in schizophrenia were partly modulated by age, gender, medication and severity of symptoms. Our results highlighted breakdowns in limbic-MPFC circuit in schizophrenia, suggesting general inability to coordinate and contextualize salient threat stimuli. These findings provide potential targets for neurotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia.

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether exposure to EA relates to distortions in responses to different facial emotions at three levels: 1) event-related potentials of the P100 and N170, 2) amygdala functional magnetic resonance imaging responses, and 3) accuracy rate or reaction time in behavioral data. The systematic literature search (PubMed and Web of Science) up to April 2020 resulted in 29 behavioral studies (n = 8555), 32 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n\u00a0= 2771), and 3 electroencephalography studies (n\u00a0= 197) for random-effect meta-analyses. EA was related to heightened bilateral amygdala reactivity to sad faces (but not other facial emotions). Exposure to EA was related to faster reaction time but a normal accuracy rate in response to angry and sad faces. In response to fearful and happy faces, EA was related to a lower accuracy rate only in individuals with recent EA exposure. This effect was more pronounced in individuals with exposure to EA before (vs. after) the age of 3 years. These findings were independent of psychiatric diagnoses. Because of the low number of eligible electroencephalography studies, no conclusions could be reached regarding the effect of EA on the event-related potentials. EA relates to alterations in behavioral and neurophysiological processing of facial emotions. Our study stresses the importance of assessing age at exposure and time since EA because these factors mediate some EA-related perturbations.

Eighteen diagnostic studies with 1205 patients evaluated the diagnostic accuracy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for intraprostatic cancer lesions.

A smaller area in the posterior ventral vmPFC is specifically involved in regulation of negative emotion. Whereas bilateral amygdala was involved during emotional exposure, only the left amygdala showed convergent activities during active regulation of negative emotions. Whole-brain analysis showed convergent activity in left ventral striatum for passive exposure to positive emotions and downregulation of negative emotions, and in the posterior cingulate cortex and ventral precuneus for passive exposure to negative emotions. These findings highlight contrasting, valence-specific subregional vmPFC as well as other regional responses during passive exposure to emotions.

The meta-analysis considered both subsequent memory (SM; remembered>forgotten) and subsequent forgetting (SF; forgotten>remembered) effects, restricting the data used to that concerning visual information encoding in healthy young adults. The meta-analysis of SM effects indicated that they most consistently associated with five neural regions: left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), bilateral fusiform cortex, bilateral hippocampal formation, bilateral premotor cortex (PMC), and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Direct comparisons of the SM effects between the studies using verbal versus pictorial material and item-memory versus associative-memory tasks yielded three main sets of findings. First, the left IFC exhibited greater SM effects during verbal material than pictorial material encoding, whereas the fusiform cortex exhibited greater SM effects during pictorial material rather than verbal material encoding. Second, bilateral hippocampal regions showed greater SM effects during pictorial material encoding compared to verbal material encoding. Furthermore, the left hippocampal region showed greater SM effects during pictorial-associative versus pictorial-item encoding. Third, bilateral PMC and PPC regions, which may support attention during encoding, exhibited greater SM effects during item encoding than during associative encoding. The meta-analysis of SF effects indicated they associated mostly with default-mode network regions, including the anterior and posterior midline cortex, the bilateral temporoparietal junction, and the bilateral superior frontal cortex. Recurrent activity oscillations between the task-positive and task-negative/default-mode networks may account for trial-to-trial variability in participants' encoding performances, which is a fundamental source of both SM and SF effects. Taken together, these findings clarify the neural activity that supports successful encoding, as well as the neural activity that leads to encoding failure.

The current study performed a voxel-wise quantitative meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation to investigate commonalities within the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature studying false memory.

Concordance maps identified significant overlap across studies for each analysis. Several regions were identified in the general false retrieval analysis as well as multiple sub-analyses, indicating their ubiquitous, yet critical role in false retrieval (medial superior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left inferior parietal cortex). Additionally, several regions showed baseline- and paradigm-specific effects (hit/perceptual relatedness: inferior and middle occipital gyrus; CRs: bilateral inferior parietal cortex, precuneus, left caudate).

Recent debate on the underlying neural substrates of visual working memory has focused on the delay period of relevant tasks. Persistent neural activity throughout the delay period has been recognized as a correlate of working memory, yet regions demonstrating sustained hemodynamic responses show inconsistency across individual studies. To develop a more precise understanding of delay-period activations during visual working memory, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis on 30 fMRI experiments involving 515 healthy adults with a mean age of 25.65 years. The main analysis revealed a widespread frontoparietal network associated with delay-period activity, as well as activation in the right inferior temporal cortex. These findings were replicated using different meta-analytical algorithms and were shown to be robust against between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. Further meta-analyses on different subgroups of experiments with specific task demands and stimulus types revealed similar delay-period networks, with activations distributed across the frontal and parietal cortices. The roles of prefrontal regions, posterior parietal regions, and inferior temporal areas are reviewed and discussed in the context of content-specific storage. We conclude that cognitive operations that occur during the unfilled delay period in visual working memory tasks can be flexibly expressed across a frontoparietal-temporal network depending on experimental parameters.

However, to date there is no review and meta-analysis of this work. We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in HIV-infected individuals using a well validated tool recently developed for use in fMRI, 'GingerALE'. Twenty-one studies (468 HIV+, 270 HIV- controls) were qualitatively reviewed, of which six (105 HIV+, 102 controls) utilized fMRI paradigms engaging the fronto-striatal-parietal network, making a quantitative analysis possible. Our meta-analysis revealed consistent functional differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus and caudate nucleus between infected participants and controls across these studies.

Although disrupted reward processing in mesolimbic dopamine circuitry is suggested to underlie pathological incentive processing in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), the differential neural processes subserving these motivational tendencies for risk situations or gain/loss choices in decision-making have not been identified. To examine the common or distinct neural mechanisms in the evaluation of risk versus outcomes for AUD, we conducted two separate coordinate-based meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies by using Seed-Based d Mapping software to evaluate 13 studies investigating gain and loss processing and 10 studies investigating risky decision-making. During gain and loss processing, relative to healthy controls, AUD patients showed reduced activation in the mesocortical-limbic circuit, including the orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum, insula, hippocampus, cerebellum, cuneus cortex and superior temporal gyrus, but hyperactivation in the inferior temporal gyrus and paracentral lobule (extending to the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and precuneus). During decision-making under risk, AUD patients exhibited hypoactivity of the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, including the posterior cingulate cortex (extending to the MCC), middle frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, OFC and anterior cingulate cortex. Our results extend existing neurological evidence by showing that a reduced response in the mesocortical-limbic circuit is found in gain versus loss processing, with decreased responsivity in cortical regions in risk decision-making. Our results implicate dissociable neural circuit responses for gain-loss processing and risk decision-making, which contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying nondrug incentive and risk processing in individuals with AUD.

CBMAs were also performed for each direction and combining both directions of group contrasts. Out of the initial 1929 studies, only eight involving 555 participants (189 patients with TRD, 156 with TSD, and 210 HC) were included. In all-effects CBMA, precentral/superior frontal gyrus showed a significant difference between TRD and HC. Functional and structural imaging meta-analyses did not yield statistically significant results. A marginally significant cluster of altered intrinsic activity was found between TRD and HC in the cerebellum/pons.

Previous neuroimaging studies have used different attention paradigms and reported both increased and reduced brain activation after sleep deprivation. However, due to large variability in sleep deprivation protocols, task paradigms, experimental designs, characteristics of subject populations, and imaging techniques, there is no consensus regarding the effects of sleep loss on the attending brain. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify brain activations that are commonly altered by acute total sleep deprivation across different attention tasks. Coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of performance on attention tasks during experimental sleep deprivation. The current version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach was used for meta-analysis. The authors searched published articles and identified 11 sleep deprivation neuroimaging studies using different attention tasks with a total of 185 participants, equaling 81 foci for ALE analysis. The meta-analysis revealed significantly reduced brain activation in multiple regions following sleep deprivation compared to rested wakefulness, including bilateral intraparietal sulcus, bilateral insula, right prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, and right parahippocampal gyrus. Increased activation was found only in bilateral thalamus after sleep deprivation compared to rested wakefulness. Acute total sleep deprivation decreases brain activation in the fronto-parietal attention network (prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus) and in the salience network (insula and medial frontal cortex). Increased thalamic activation after sleep deprivation may reflect a complex interaction between the de-arousing effects of sleep loss and the arousing effects of task performance on thalamic activity.

Since its inception, it has become one of the leading explanations for how humans are able to operate on a cognitive level. The current study probed the neural networks underlying one of the most commonly used tasks, delayed match-to-sample (DMTS), to study WM. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis of 42 functional neuroimaging studies (626 participants) was conducted to demonstrate neural network engagement during DMTS. Results demonstrated strong convergence in brain regions commonly associated with the working memory construct (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex). However, neural activation in two regions frequently attributed to WM were absent from this meta-analysis: the anterior cingulate and the rostral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that these regions may be more sensitive to task or stimuli characteristics. In a post-hoc analysis, we deconstructed the DMTS meta-analysis to examine nonverbal versus verbal stimuli, and found notable neurofunctional differences such that DMTS using nonverbal stimuli consistently engaged the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 6/46) and precuneus (BA 7) more so than verbal stimuli based DMTS. These results provide a foundation for future models of functional connectivity that may elucidate subtle differences in working memory attributable to pathological processes.

To evaluate these predictions, a meta-analysis of prior neuroimaging studies and a within-subjects fMRI experiment contrasting unpracticed to practiced performance in a paired-associate task were conducted. The principal effect of practice was found to be a reduction in the extent and magnitude of activity in a cortical network spanning bilateral dorsal prefrontal, left ventral prefrontal, medial frontal (anterior cingulate), left insular, bilateral parietal, and occipito-temporal (fusiform) areas.

In persons with motor altered processing (MAP), there appeared to be a suppression of activity in key pain regions such as the insula, thalamus, and postcentral gyrus. As such, activation within the motor system may play a critical role in dampening pain symptoms in persons with SAP, and in suppressing activity in key pain regions of the brain in persons with MAP.

We implemented seven eligibility criteria to vet articles for full-text review. Twenty-nine studies remained for full-text review after our systematic review process was completed. Studies were subjected to several levels of analysis. First, pre-and post- test post-traumatic growth inventory (PTGI) scores were collected from all studies and analyzed through a forest plot using Hedges' g. Next, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates and t-scores were collected and analyzed using an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) to measure brain function. T-scores and Hedges' g values were then analyzed using Pearson correlations to determine if there were any relationships between brain function and post-traumatic growth for each modality. Lastly, all studies were subjected to a bubble plot and Egger's test to assess risk of publication bias across the review sample.

Recently, several structural and functional neuroimaging studies have been conducted in patients with insomnia disorder, but these studies have yielded diverse findings. Here, we aimed to identify consistent patterns of abnormal brain alterations in insomnia disorder by performing a quantitative coordinate-based meta-analysis. Following the preferred reporting for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement, we searched PubMed database and used reference tracking and finally retrieved 19 eligible studies (six task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, eight resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, three voxel-based morphometry, and two positron emission tomography). We extracted peak coordinates from these studies and tested for convergence using the activation likelihood estimation method. Using this method, we found no significant convergent evidence for combination of structural atrophy and functional disturbances across previous studies (p\u00a0=\u00a00.914). Inconsistencies across these studies might be related to heterogonous clinical populations, the explorative nature of these studies in combination with small sample sizes, different experimental designs, and various preprocessing and statistical approaches. Future neuroimaging studies on insomnia disorder should include larger well-characterized samples, as well as standard imaging and analysis protocols.

Second, an emergent and mounting set of data has suggested an anterior-posterior neurofunctional gradient. However, no study has examined these theories, and their potential interaction, using objective, robust methodological approaches. Here, we employed an established meta-analytic technique and use ultra-high field, high-resolution functional and structural neuroimaging to examine hippocampal lateralization with consideration for a long-axis differentiation. Data revealed strong support for an evolutionarily preserved hemispheric specialization. Specifically, we found intra- and interhemispheric differences with regard to anterior and posterior functional and structural connectivity, between the right and left hippocampi. For task-independent functional connectivity, we found the right anterior hippocampus to have functional connectivity with a large, distributed network, whereas the left anterior hippocampus demonstrated primarily fronto-limbic connectivity. These patterns were reversed for the posterior segmentations. Not surprisingly, for task-dependent connectivity, we found interhemispheric differences within key ipsilateral structures (i.e., parahippocampal gyrus) for both anterior and posterior segmentations. Furthermore, we identified pivotal neural hubs that share connectivity across behavioral domains, and are supported by structural connectivity (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex). Thus, our data provide evidence for a hemisphere-specific, anterior-posterior specialization of the hippocampal formation.

They also showed greater activation in right frontal and parietal regions, particularly those held to be involved in domain-general controlled processing, and principally when they performed more poorly than the young.

This quantitative meta-analysis re-examines the activation associated with episodic memory in AD and MCI as compared to cognitively normal populations to assess these commonly cited activation differences. A whole-brain activation likelihood estimation based meta-analysis was conducted on fMRI studies that examined episodic memory in HOA (n = 200), MCI (n = 131), and AD populations (n = 89; total n = 409). Diffuse activation was exhibited in the HOA sample, while activation was more limited in the clinical populations. Additionally, the HOA sample showed more activation in the right hippocampus compared to the AD sample. The MCI studies showed greater activation in the cerebellum compared to the HOA sample, potentially indicating a compensatory mechanism for verbal encoding. MTL hypoactivation in the AD sample is consistent with previous studies, but more evidence of MCI hyperactivation is needed before considering MTL activation as an early biomarker for the AD disease process.

Warm glow theory suggests that cooperative behavior is driven by positive emotions, whereas inequity aversion theory proposes that cooperative behavior is necessary to avoid negative feelings. However, the precise characteristics underlying the enforcement (fairness or reciprocity) and violation (unfairness or betrayal) of cooperation remain elusive. Moreover, whether the neural mechanism of cooperation as a partner or a spectator is the same remains unclear. To resolve the above issues, we summarized the findings of human cooperation neuroimaging studies through a meta-analysis. Based on our results, cooperation enforcement activates reward-related brain areas, such as the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, only during other-cooperation. In contrast, cooperation violation is associated with the negative emotion-related insula in both self- and other-noncooperation. Thus, people expect others to cooperate rather than themselves; however, people are disgusted when cooperation is violated by themselves or others. Taken together, cooperative behavior might be mainly driven by a process designed to avoid negative emotion, which supports the inequity aversion theory but not the warm glow theory, thereby improving our understanding of cooperation theory.

Results revealed that, compared with individuals without depression, individuals with depression showed higher activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) for positive emotional stimuli and higher activation in the MFG, inferior frontal gyrus, and insula for negative emotional stimuli. Moreover, we identified that the MFG was consistently activated in individuals with depression regardless of the type of emotional stimuli. However, we did not find distinct patterns of brain activity between positive and negative emotional stimuli in individuals with depression. Our results demonstrated that both positive and negative emotional stimuli processing shares the same cognitive control-related brain regions in individuals with depression.

Spontaneous neural activity, measured at rest using various neuroimaging techniques (e.g., regional homogeneity [ReHo], amplitude of low frequency fluctuations [ALFF]), can provide insight about baseline neurobiological factors influencing sensory, cognitive, or behavioral processes associated with PTSD. The present study used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct the largest-to-date quantitative meta-analysis of spontaneous neural activity in PTSD, including 457 PTSD cases, 292 trauma-exposed controls (TECs), and 293 non-traumatized controls (NTCs) across 22 published studies. Five regions-of-interest (ROIs) were identified where activity differed between PTSD cases and controls: one when compared to all controls (left globus pallidus), two when compared to TECs (left inferior parietal lobule [IPL] and right lingual gyrus), and two when compared to NTCs (left amygdala and right caudate head). To corroborate these results, a second analysis was conducted using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on an independent sample of 205 previously-deployed US military veterans. In this analysis, converging evidence from ReHo and ALFF showed that spontaneous neural activity in the left IPL alone was positively correlated with PTSD symptom severity. This result is consistent with theoretical accounts that link left IPL activity with PTSD-relevant processes such as processing of emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) and the extent that attention is captured by salient autobiographical memories. By modeling the neurobiological correlates of PTSD, we can increase our understanding of this debilitating disorder and guide the development of future clinical innovations.

Results revealed in those with active drug addiction hypoactivation of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), compared with healthy controls. Weakening of the dACC and MFG activations was particularly pronounced in nicotine users, respectively. Impaired task performance was also associated with diminished MFG activation. In contrast, abstinent users did not exhibit any significant differences compared with healthy controls. Those with behavioral addictions were characterized by higher midcingulate cortical activation. Thus, the neural disengagement during response inhibition in active drug addiction was limited to a small number of prefrontal cortical regions and dependent on population characteristics.

Although automatic imitation forms a key part of daily social interactions, we do not copy other people indiscriminately. Instead, we control imitative tendencies by prioritising some actions and inhibiting others. To date, neuroimaging studies investigating the control of automatic imitation have produced inconsistent findings. Some studies suggest that imitation control relies on a domain-specific neural circuit related to social cognition (the theory-of-mind network). In contrast, other studies show engagement of a domain-general neural circuit that is engaged during a diverse range of cognitive control tasks (the multiple demand network). Given the inconsistency of prior findings, in the current paper we avoided problems associated with interpreting individual studies by performing a meta-analysis. To do so, we used a multi-level kernel density analysis to quantitatively identify consistent patterns of activation across functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the control of imitation. Our results show clear and consistent evidence across studies that the control of automatic imitation is guided by brain regions in the multiple demand network including dorsolateral frontoparietal cortex. In contrast, there was only limited evidence that regions in the theory of mind network were engaged. Indeed, medial prefrontal cortex showed no consistent engagement and right temporoparietal junction engagement may reflect spatial rather than imitative control. As such, the current meta-analysis reinforces the role of domain-general control mechanisms and provides limited evidence in support of the role of domain-specific processes in regulating imitative tendencies. Consequently, neurocognitive models of imitation need updating to place more emphasis on domain-general control mechanisms, as well as to consider more complex organisational structures of control, which may involve contributions from multiple cognitive systems.

However, it has remained unclear which EF-related brain regions are affected consistently, because the results of pertinent neuroimaging studies and earlier meta-analyses vary considerably. We, therefore, conducted new rigorous meta-analyses of published age differences in EF-related brain activity. Out of a larger set of regions associated with EFs, only left inferior frontal junction and left anterior cuneus/precuneus were found to show consistent age differences. To further characterize these two age-sensitive regions, we performed seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) analyses using fMRI data from a large adult sample with a wide age range. We also assessed associations of the two regions' whole-brain RS-FC patterns with age and EF performance. Although our results largely point toward a domain-general role of left inferior frontal junction in EFs, the pattern of individual study contributions to the meta-analytic results suggests process-specific modulations by age. Our analyses further indicate that the left anterior cuneus/precuneus is recruited differently by older (compared with younger) adults during EF tasks, potentially reflecting inefficiencies in switching the attentional focus. Overall, our findings question earlier meta-analytic results and suggest a larger heterogeneity of age-related differences in brain activity associated with EFs. Hence, they encourage future research that pays greater attention to replicability, investigates age-related differences in deactivation, and focuses on more narrowly defined EF subprocesses, combining multiple behavioral assessments with multimodal imaging.

By conducting a meta\u00ad-analysis on morphometric and functional imaging studies of grey matter alterations in drug-free patients, the present study aims to examine the degree of overlap between brain regions with anatomic and functional changes in patients with schizophrenia. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant publications. A multimodal analysis was then conducted using Seed-based d Mapping software. Exploratory analyses included jackknife, subgroup and meta-regression analyses. We included 15 structural MRI studies comprising 486 drug-free patients and 485 healthy controls, and 16 functional MRI studies comprising 403 drug-free patients and 428 controls in our meta-analysis. Drug-free patients were examined to reduce pharmacological effects on the imaging data. Multimodal analysis showed considerable overlap between anatomic and functional changes, mainly in frontotemporal regions, bilateral medial posterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, bilateral insula, basal ganglia and left cerebellum. There were also brain regions showing only anatomic changes in the right superior frontal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, right lingual gyrus and functional alternations involving the right angular \u00adgyrus. The methodological aspects, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous, and we cannot exclude medication effects. The present study showed overlapping anatomic and functional brain abnormalities mainly in the default mode (DMN) and auditory networks (AN) in drug-free patients with schizophrenia. However, the pattern of changes differed in these networks. Decreased grey matter was associated with decreased activation within the DMN, whereas it was associated with increased activation within the AN. These discrete patterns suggest different pathophysiological changes impacting structural and functional associations within different neural networks in patients with schizophrenia.

Factors contributing to resilience and recovery are notable because although most people will experience a traumatic event during their lifetimes, only 6% to 10% are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationship between an individual and their social environment is determined both by the quality of the social environment itself, and by the individual's perception and understanding of information conveyed by the other people around them. However, little research has considered the contribution of these internal social cognitive processes to PTSD risk or resilience. The current review draws on the existing literature on social cognitive functioning in trauma exposure and PTSD, identifying key questions and themes for future research. We utilized a meta-analytic approach to assess the evidence for alterations in social cognition in PTSD, finding a consistent large deficit in social cognitive performance in PTSD groups relative to trauma-exposed and healthy controls. We then reviewed the literature on the interaction of genes and the social environment, supporting the hypothesis that social cognitive deficits are a preexisting risk factor for PTSD. Finally, we reviewed relevant neuroimaging findings, which suggest that alterations in social cognition affect the perception of threat cues in PTSD. Overall, research on social cognition and PTSD is still emerging, but existing findings suggest this is an important and understudied area for the understanding of PTSD.

While their respective neural correlates have been widely studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), few direct comparisons between these processes have been conducted. We conducted a meta-analysis of fMRI studies of reappraisal and fear extinction, with the aim of examining both commonalities and differences in their neural correlates. We also conducted independent analyses that focused on specific reappraisal strategies (reinterpretation, distancing). Overall, we observed that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the bilateral anterior insular cortex (AIC) were similarly consistently engaged by reappraisal and extinction. Extinction was more consistently linked to activation of sensory and emotion processing regions, whereas reappraisal was more consistently associated with activation of a dorsal fronto-parietal network. Interestingly, the amygdala was preferentially deactivated by distancing. These results suggest that the dACC and the AIC are involved in domain-general regulatory networks. Differences between extinction and reappraisal could be explained by their relative processing demands on visual perceptual versus higher cognitive neural systems.

We identified common and distinct patterns of neural engagement for BD and MDD within the facial affect processing network. Both disorders were associated with increased engagement of limbic regions. Diagnosis-specific differences were observed in cortical, thalamic and striatal regions. Decreased ventrolateral prefrontal cortical engagement was associated with BD while relative hypoactivation of the sensorimotor cortices was seen in MDD. Increased responsiveness in the thalamus and basal ganglia were associated with BD. These findings were modulated by stimulus valence.

Magnetic resonance imaging studies published up to July 2013 investigating structural or functional brain correlates of suicidal behavior were identified through computerized and manual literature searches. Activation foci from 12 studies encompassing 475 individuals, i.e., 213 suicide attempters and 262 psychiatric controls were subjected to meta-analytical study using anatomic or activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Activation likelihood estimation revealed structural deficits and functional changes in association with a history of suicidal behavior. Structural findings included reduced volumes of the rectal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and caudate nucleus. Functional differences between study groups included an increased reactivity of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. A history of suicidal behavior appears to be associated with (probably interrelated) structural deficits and functional overactivation in brain areas, which contribute to a decision-making network. The findings suggest that a vulnerability to suicidal behavior can be defined in terms of a reduced motivational control over the intentional behavioral reaction to salient negative stimuli.

Therefore, other variables (such as doses taken per occasion) might be more important determinants. Positive associations between time of abstinence and SERT density might indicate that these alterations are reversible to some extent.

These negative affective experiences are accompanied by physiological arousal, as if the individual were facing an external stressor. Perseverative cognition is a transdiagnostic symptom, yet studies of neural mechanisms are largely restricted to specific clinical populations (e.g. patients with major depression). The present study applied activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to 43 functional neuroimaging studies of perseverative cognition to elucidate the neurobiological substrates across individuals with and without psychopathological conditions. Task-related and resting state functional connectivity studies were examined in separate meta-analyses. Across task-based studies, perseverative cognition engaged medial frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, insula, and posterior cingulate cortex. Resting state functional connectivity studies similarly implicated posterior cingulate cortex together with thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), yet the involvement of ACC distinguished between perseverative cognition in healthy controls (HC) and clinical groups. Perseverative cognition is accompanied by the engagement of prefrontal, insula and cingulate regions, whose interaction may support the characteristic conjunction of self-referential and affective processing with (aberrant) cognitive control and embodied (autonomic) arousal. Within this context, ACC engagement appears critical for the pathological expression of rumination and worry.

Conclusions from single experiments are usually constrained by small sample sizes and high variability across studies. Here, we used coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses to provide a quantitative synthesis of the current literature on motor-related neural activity after stroke. Of over 1000 PubMed search results through January 2011, 36 studies reported standardized whole-brain group coordinates. Meta-analyses were performed on 54 experimental contrasts for movements of the paretic upper limb (472 patients, 452 activation foci) and on 20 experiments comparing activation between patients and healthy controls (177 patients, 113 activation foci). We computed voxelwise correlations between activation likelihood and motor impairment, time post-stroke, and task difficulty across samples. Patients showed higher activation likelihood in contralesional primary motor cortex (M1), bilateral ventral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) relative to healthy subjects. Activity in contralesional areas was more likely found for active than for passive tasks. Better motor performance was associated with greater activation likelihood in ipsilesional M1, pre-SMA, contralesional premotor cortex and cerebellum. Over time post-stroke, activation likelihood in bilateral premotor areas and medial M1 hand knob decreased. This meta-analysis shows that increased activation in contralesional M1 and bilateral premotor areas is a highly consistent finding after stroke despite high inter-study variance resulting from different fMRI tasks and motor impairment levels. However, a good functional outcome relies on the recruitment of the original functional network rather than on contralesional activity.

Music might be a sensitive probe for social cognition abilities, but underlying neurobiological substrates are unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies in FTD patients and functional MRI studies for music perception and social cognition tasks in cognitively normal controls to identify robust patterns of atrophy (FTD) or activation (music perception or social cognition). Conjunction analyses were performed to identify overlapping brain regions. In total 303 articles were included: 53 for FTD (n\u00a0=\u00a01153 patients, 42.5% female; 1337 controls, 53.8% female), 28 for music perception (n\u00a0=\u00a0540, 51.8% female) and 222 for social cognition in controls (n\u00a0=\u00a05664, 50.2% female). We observed considerable overlap in atrophy patterns associated with FTD, and functional activation associated with music perception and social cognition, mostly encompassing the ventral language network. We further observed overlap across all three modalities in mesolimbic, basal forebrain and striatal regions. The results of our meta-analysis suggest that music perception and social cognition share neurobiological circuits that are affected in FTD. This supports the idea that music might be a sensitive probe for social cognition abilities with implications for diagnosis and monitoring.

Studies have found increased/decreased entropy of brain signals in psychiatric patients. There is no consistent conclusion regarding the relationship between the entropy of brain signals and mental illness. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to identify consistent abnormalities in the brain signal entropy in patients with different mental illnesses. We conducted a systematic search to collect resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies in patients with psychiatric disorders. This work identified 9 eligible rs-fMRI studies, which included a total of 14 experiments, 67 activation foci, and 1383 subjects. We tested the convergence across their findings by using the activation likelihood estimation method. P-value maps were corrected by using cluster-level family-wise error p\u2009<\u20090.05 and permuting 2000 times. Results showed that patients with different psychiatric disorders shared commonly increased entropy of brain signals in the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, and the right fusiform gyrus, cuneus, precuneus. No shared alterations were found in the subcortical regions and cerebellum in the patient group. Our findings suggested that the increased entropy of brain signals in the cortex, not subcortical regions and cerebellum, might have associations with the pathophysiology across mental illnesses. This meta-analysis study provided the first comprehensive understanding of the abnormality in brain signal complexity across patients with different psychiatric disorders.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal alterations of VS activity during reward processing in patients with chronic psychosis and first episode of psychosis, as well as individuals at high risk for psychosis, but findings are inconclusive, conflicting, and difficult to subject to meta-analysis without introducing bias because several studies reported that findings were not statistically significant but did not report statistics. To assess the differences between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and healthy controls in VS activation during reward processing. Web of Knowledge database (incorporating Web of Science and MEDLINE) until July 2015, including references of eligible articles and reviews. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing VS activity during monetary reward processing between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders or clinical or genetic high-risk state for psychosis and healthy controls. Statistics and thresholds related to the main outcome measures and potential moderators were independently retrieved by 2 investigators. Effect sizes were analyzed using MetaNSUE, a random-effects method that enables the unbiased inclusion of nonstatistically significant unreported effects. Effect size of the group differences in VS activity, and correlation between VS activity and negative and positive symptom scores in patients. The meta-analysis included 23 studies (917 patients) for reward anticipation, 9 studies (358 patients) for reward feedback, and 8 studies (314 patients) for reward prediction error. We found significant bilateral VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation (23 studies, n\u2009=\u2009917) in patients compared with healthy controls (left/right Cohen d, -0.50/-0.70; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Left VS abnormality was more severe in patients with high scores of negative symptoms during reward anticipation (r\u2009=\u2009-0.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients also showed hypoactivation during reward feedback (left/right d, -0.57/-0.56; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Simulations showed that exclusion of studies with nonstatistically significant unreported effects was associated with a strong bias (d bias\u2009=\u20090.22), whereas estimations using MetaNSUE were unbiased even when statistics were seldom reported (d bias\u2009<\u20090.001). This meta-analysis provides evidence that patients with psychosis demonstrate VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation. The assessment of VS prediction errors seems to be promising, but more studies are needed to draw valid conclusions.

To this end, our neuroimaging meta-analysis included 20 studies and investigated the influence of physical exercise on cognition-related functional brain activation. The overall meta-analysis encompassing all experiments revealed physical exercise-induced changes in the left parietal lobe during cognitive processing. Subgroup analysis further revealed that in the younger-age group (< 35\u00a0years old) physical exercise induced more widespread changes in the right hemisphere, whereas in the older-age group (\u2265\u200935\u00a0years old) exercise-induced changes were restricted to the left parietal lobe. Subgroup analysis for intervention duration showed that shorter exercise interventions induced changes in regions connected with frontoparietal and default mode networks, whereas regions exhibiting effects of longer interventions connected with frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Our findings suggest that physical exercise interventions lead to changes in functional activation patterns primarily located in precuneus and associated with frontoparietal, dorsal attention and default mode networks.
