Those sanctions are based on different motivation aspects, depending on the context. Altruistic punishment occurs if punishment aims to re\u2010establish the social norms even at cost for the punisher. Retaliatory punishment is driven by anger or spite and aims to harm the other. While neuroimaging research highlighted the neural networks supporting decision\u2010making in both types of punishment in isolation, it remains unclear whether they rely on the same or distinct neural systems. We ran an activation likelihood estimation meta\u2010analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 24 altruistic and 19 retaliatory punishment studies to investigate the neural correlates of decision\u2010making underlying social punishment and whether altruistic and retaliatory punishments share similar brain networks.

When detecting social norms violations such as unfairness and inequity, individuals often react punitively toward social norm violators. The umbrella term for this behavior is social punishment (Zinchenko,\u00a0 ). In contrast to punishment by a neutral third person, punishment directly inflicted by the victim toward the perpetrator is labeled \u201csecond\u2010party punishment\u201d (SPP, Fehr & Fischbacher,\u00a0 ). Importantly, SPP occurs without any benefit for the punisher other than re\u2010establishing the social norm, which depicts the primary motivation. If it entails a certain cost for the punisher, it is conceptualized as \u201caltruistic punishment\u201d (Du & Chang,\u00a0 ), wherein altruistic refers to the sacrifice of a personal gain to punish unfairness and to reinforce the social norm (Fehr & G\u00e4chter,\u00a0 ). \n\nHowever, SPP may originate not only from a prosocial but also from a spiteful motivation (Bra\u00f1as\u2010Garza, Esp\u00edn, Exadaktylos, & Herrmann,\u00a0 ; Emmerling et al.,  ; Jensen,\u00a0 ; Yamagishi et al.,\u00a0 ). Interestingly, the latter broadly matches retaliatory aggression. A retaliatory or reactive response is an aggressive response to provocation which is often driven by anger (Blair,\u00a0 ). Individuals tend to retaliate provocations and retaliation is even reciprocally increasing with higher provocations (Kr\u00e4mer, Jansma, Tempelmann, & M\u00fcnte,\u00a0 ). We conceptualize this form of SPP originating from a spiteful motivation as \u201cretaliatory SPP.\u201d Importantly, provocation is a crucial component of SPP, as both altruistic and retaliatory forms of SPP are direct responses to provocation. Thus, when considering SPP and the cognitive processes underlying SPP, provocation must be taken into account, as any decision leading to SPP starts with experiencing and processing provocation. Consequently, it is hard to separate the pure act of punishment from provocation. As the present study focuses on decision\u2010making in SPP, and not on the punishment execution per se, this may also partly include decisions that are not representing a punishment (but its rejection). Whether they result in a punishment or not, the cognitive processes that follow a provocation deal with the decision about applying or not applying a punishment considering the gain and the costs of the potential punishment. Indeed, previous studies on altruistic SPP have shown a strong correlation between unfair offers (provocation) and rejected offers (punishment), meaning that unfair offers tend to be rejected (Camerer,\u00a0 ). The same strong correlation between provocation and punishment applies to retaliatory SPP. There is a well\u2010replicated positive association between provocation and retaliation, meaning that provocation reliably elicits retaliation (Konzok et al.,  ; Kr\u00e4mer et al.,\u00a0 ; Weidler et al.,\u00a0 ). Nevertheless, the strict distinction between scenarios in which a punishment would result in an altruistic decision and scenarios in which a punishment would be a retaliatory decision is artificial to a certain extent; in real\u2010world situations there can be different types and entities of cost for the punishment and more complex evaluations to be made that can result in an overlap of the two concepts. In this manuscript, we refer to the main focus of different laboratory scenarios (outlined further below) determining the motivation to punish an opponent. \n\nWhether the motivational differences between altruistic and retaliatory SPP are reflected in distinct neurocognitive processes is currently unknown. Understanding the mechanisms involved in altruistic and retaliatory SPP is crucial for identifying the neural mechanisms that differentiate a more socially accepted and adaptive behavior (altruistic SPP) from retaliatory SPP, that is, especially in extreme forms, socially undesirable. Moreover, the latter is associated with violent behaviors and is often a transdiagnostic marker found across psychiatric disorders (Nelson & Trainor,\u00a0 ). \n\nDifferent paradigms have been established to either, investigate altruistic SPP, or retaliatory SPP. To investigate altruistic SPP many studies used the Ultimatum Game (UG). The UG typically involves two players, one in the role of the proposer and one on the responder's role, who have to decide how to split a sum of money among each other (for a comprehensive account, see G\u00fcth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze,\u00a0 ). While the proposer freely decides how to split the money, the responder can only accept or reject the proposer's offer. Rejecting an offer means that neither the responder nor the proposer receives money. Since the responder is giving up on the money for the purpose of punishing norm violation (i.e., unfairness), rejecting an unfair offer represents altruistic SPP. Different aspects of altruistic SPP have been studied by modified versions of the UG including behavioral and neural measures (Civai, Crescentini, Rustichini, & Rumiati,\u00a0 ; G\u00fcro\u011flu, van den Bos, Rombouts, & Crone,\u00a0 ; Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen,\u00a0 ; Wei, Zhao, & Zheng,\u00a0 ). \n\nMost established tasks to study retaliatory SPP are the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP; Taylor,\u00a0 ) and the Points Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP; Cherek, Schnapp, Moeller, & Dougherty,  ; Skibsted et al.,\u00a0 ). In the TAP, participants compete for a reward with an ostensible opponent in a reaction time task. At the beginning of each trial, every player chooses a punishment level for the opponent that will become effective after the competition. The player who loses the competition will be punished as previously chosen by the other player. Different TAP versions employed various punishment modalities, including electric shocks (Taylor,\u00a0 ), money subtraction (Repple et al.,\u00a0 ; Wagels et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Weidler et al.,\u00a0 ; Weidler, Habel, et al.,\u00a0 ), noise blasts (Bushman,  ; Kr\u00e4mer et al.,\u00a0 ), or heat stimuli (Weidler, Habel, et al.,  ). Importantly, the decision about the punishment for the opponent does not relate to the earnings of the participant and neither does the participant have to sacrifice own earnings. In the PSAP, participants can choose to earn or steal points from the opponent and are repeatedly provoked by having their points stolen by the opponent. Unlike in the TAP, participants in the PSAP can escape the punishment by choosing to shield their points, instead of earning more or stealing the other's points. The number of stolen points is an indirect measure of retaliatory punishment but does neither come with a reward nor cost for the punishing participant. \n\nBoth the UG and the aggression paradigms involve a provocative behavior (e.g., receiving an unfair offer, punishment) by another person (proposer or opponent) and a response to such provocation (e.g., rejection of the unfair offer, retaliation, etc.). As such, both paradigms capture behaviors linked to SPP and the intent to signal disagreement with the opponent's behavior by punishing him/her. The costs for this punishment, however, are different in the UG compared with aggression tasks. Certainly, aggression tasks contain losses for the player in the form of provocation (as point losses in the PSAP, for instance). Administering the punishment to the opponent, however, brings no direct cost to the punisher. Thus, the costs and the retaliatory behavior are not directly related and there is no need to overcome self\u2010interest to carry out the punishment in aggression tasks successfully. In contrast, altruistic punishment in the UG requires overcoming self\u2010interest as for each rejected offer, the responder renounces a potential gain in order to punish the proposer. Consequently, we assume that the different underlying motivation differentiates altruistic SPP from aggression paradigms. To be specific, in the UG, participants have to pay for being able to punish. This corresponds to a decision for a superordinate goal, while the goal in aggression tasks is directly the punishment selection itself. From a conceptual perspective, this might be the key point that distinguishes decision\u2010making processes involved in altruistic from retaliatory SPP but it is unclear if this conceptual difference has a neural basis. \n\nNeuronal networks play an important role in models that describe decision\u2010making in SPP. Previous research on altruistic SPP tentatively supports the norm violation model, according to which rejecting unfair offers corresponds to a rejection of norm violations (Civai et al.,\u00a0 ; Corradi\u2010Dell'Acqua, Civai, Rumiati, & Fink,\u00a0 ; Gabay, Radua, Kempton, & Mehta,\u00a0 ). Specifically, Feng, Luo, and Krueger\u00a0( ) suggest that altruistic SPP is supported by two separable but interacting neuronal networks involved in fairness\u2010related norm enforcement (Buckholtz & Marois,\u00a0 ; Lieberman,\u00a0 ; Sanfey & Chang,\u00a0 ) as well as in decision\u2010making, as first proposed by Kahneman\u00a0( ): one that is reflexive and intuitive (System 1) and one that is deliberate (System 2). System 1 comprises the anterior insula and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and represents intuitive, automatic, and rapid responses to social norm violations. These responses collide with economic self\u2010interest and the ensuing conflict is encoded in the dorsal ACC (dACC), which then signals the need to resolve it to the second system (for a detailed review on dACC function, see Heilbronner & Hayden,\u00a0 ). The dACC is also referred to as anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), as defined by Vogt\u00a0( ) based on cytoarchitectonic information and structural and functional connectivity (see also Vogt,\u00a0 ). To prevent confusion, we will refer to this region as dACC/aMCC throughout this manuscript. Besides the dACC/aMCC, system 2 includes the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the rostral ACC (rACC), and the right dlPFC and is involved in resolving the conflict. Selecting economic self\u2010interest and accepting unfair offers or over\u2010riding economic self\u2010interest and rejecting unfair offers are possible conflict resolution outcomes. Altruistic SPP can be observed if economic self\u2010interest is overridden and unfair offers are rejected, via activation of System 1, for evaluation of the norm violation, of the dACC/aMCC, to encode and signal the conflict with self\u2010interest and of the right dlPFC, to suppress self\u2010interest in order to punish. \n\nThis network model is partially supported by the meta\u2010analytical findings of Zinchenko\u00a0( ). The authors reported convergent bilateral activation in the anterior insula and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG, corresponding broadly to the dlPFC), areas related to salience and central\u2010executive networks. However, instead of dACC/aMCC activation, the authors found convergent activation of the right interior frontal gyrus (rIFG, corresponding to the ventrolateral PFC). This may highlight the involvement of emotional empathy required to understand others' intentions. Additionally, a meta\u2010analysis by Gabay et al.\u00a0( ) on the UG proposes a potential role of reward in punishing violations of social norms. Rejecting an unfair offer as a mean of punishment allows the participant to overcome the negative emotions elicited by inequality experience, which may be inherently satisfactory and rewarding. \n\nMeta\u2010analytic findings on aggression paradigms suggest that activation of the left postcentral gyrus reflects action execution (Wong et al.,\u00a0 ). Others allocate a network including the anterior insula/IFG and the ACC to aggressive actions (Puiu et al.,\u00a0 ). These areas are part of the salience network involved in information decoding and preparation for action execution. In particular, the anterior insula/IFG detects salient information and forwards it to the ACC, which then integrates it in preparation for appropriate responses. Lastly, a recent meta\u2010analysis focusing on the role of the cerebellum in anger and threat processing and active aggression expression in healthy and clinical populations has shown involvement of the posterior cerebellum in anger and involvement of the anterior cerebellum in aggression (Klaus & Schutter,\u00a0 ). The posterior cerebellum is functionally associated with the somatomotor, the frontoparietal, and the default mode network (ACC, dlPFC, and vmPFC) and with the insula, the brainstem, and the angular gyrus. The anterior cerebellum is functionally coupled with somatomotor, somatosensory (spanning the postcentral gyrus), frontoparietal, limbic, and ventral attention network and with the posterior cingulate, that is part of the default mode network (Buckner, Krienen, Castellanos, Diaz, & Yeo,\u00a0 ; Klaus & Schutter,\u00a0 ). Given the extent of the functional connections of the cerebellum, its activation in anger processing and aggression expression may represent functional modulation of other areas involved in retaliatory SPP, such as the anterior insula/IFG, ACC, and postcentral gyrus reported in other meta\u2010analyses (Puiu et al.,\u00a0 ; Wong et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTo our knowledge, no meta\u2010analysis to date has compared the decision processes in altruistic and retaliatory SPP to elucidate their shared and different neural mechanisms. Neural patterns associated to these concepts may support our understanding of the similarity or differences of the respective motivational processes involved in decision\u2010making. Thus, meta\u2010analytically determining the functional divergence and convergence of both constructs is the primary interest and first aim of this review. Both types of punishment may differ in the neural substrates involved in overcoming self\u2010interest, which would be more pronounced in altruistic compared with retaliatory SPP. Specifically, we expect: (a) overlapping activation in the anterior insula/IFG and the dACC/aMCC, reflecting detection, decoding, and integration of the information related to the norm\u2010violation/provocative behavior; and (b) activation in the right dlPFC specific to altruistic SPP, reflecting overcoming self\u2010interest. Our second aim is to identify the networks generally involved in SPP, as these networks may support emotional processing and decision making in SPP. Our third aim is to update previous meta\u2010analytic findings on altruistic SPP assessed with the UG paradigm and on retaliatory SPP. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nStudies were only included if, in the case of altruistic SPP, they involved SPP taking place in social interaction and the punishment occurred in response to unfair monetary splits. Retaliatory SPP studies were only included if they involved deliberate provocation, which resulted in retaliatory SPP. We excluded studies based on the following criteria: participants under 18\u2009years old, irrelevant tasks, literature reviews, no reported fMRI data, only resting\u2010state fMRI data, single case studies, and no relevant contrasts/between\u2010group contrasts. Only studies reporting whole\u2010brain results for healthy adults were included. We selected our studies from two literature searches conducted in January 2021 on PubMed, one search for altruistic and one for retaliatory SPP. Study selection was conducted by two raters. In case of disagreement, a third rater was consulted for consensus. \n\nFor the altruistic SPP meta\u2010analysis, we conducted a standard search using the term \u201cultimatum game\u201d in combination with \u201cfMRI,\u201d which yielded   n  \u00a0=\u00a079 studies [entire search string: (ultimatum game) AND (fMRI)]. We found seven additional studies in review articles. After abstract screening and checking for duplicates 11 articles were excluded resulting in 75 articles for full\u2010text review. After scanning for exclusion criteria, 24 studies with 30 experiments remained (22 unfair > fair and 8 reject > accept) including 692 subjects and 275 foci. We additionally contacted authors of the included manuscript to request data on the reject > accept contrast when not available in the published manuscripts. One author could provide the requested data, resulting in a total of 24 studies with 31 experiments (22 unfair > fair and 9 reject > accept) including 692 subjects and 278 foci (Figure\u00a0 ). All studies included for altruistic punishment used either the ultimatum game or modified versions thereof. More details on the selection process, including number of studies excluded and reasons for the exclusion are available in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nPRISMA flowcharts for the search and eligibility of the articles for the altruistic SPP analysis (on the left) and the retaliatory SPP analysis (on the right). The search was conducted in January 2021 \n  \nFor the retaliatory SPP meta\u2010analysis, we conducted a standard search using the terms \u201cTaylor aggression paradigm,\u201d \u201ccompetitive reaction time,\u201d \u201cretaliation,\u201d and \u201cprovocation\u201d in combination with \u201cfMRI\u201d [entire search string: (Taylor aggression paradigm) AND (fMRI); (competitive reaction time) AND (fMRI); (retaliation) AND (fMRI); (provocation) AND (fMRI)]. These searches yielded a total of   n  \u00a0=\u00a0683 studies. We found four additional studies in review articles. One additional study, not published yet, was kindly provided by authors of our team. The high number of studies was first screened based on article titles and abstract that clearly pointed to unrelated topics (e.g., provocation of disease symptoms instead of social provocation). After removing duplicates and not topic related articles, 83 studies were screened in a full\u2010text review. This yielded 19 studies with 25 experiments (9 feedback phase, 12 decision phase, and 4 in which the two phases were not separated) on 659 subjects, and 250 foci that entered analysis (Figure\u00a0 ). Most studies included for retaliatory SPP used the Taylor aggression paradigm (79%) with the remaining four using the social network aggression task, the fight\u2010or\u2010escape task, the Pain Stimulation Task and the PSAP. More details on the selection process, including number of studies excluded and reasons for the exclusion are available in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\nFollowing M\u00fcller et al.\u00a0( ) recommendations, only experiments reporting results in a standard stereotactic reference space (MNI, Talairach) were included in our study and converted into the same space. All studies we planned to include reported coordinates in standard stereotactic reference space, so no study was excluded for this reason. Talairach coordinates were converted into MNI coordinates using the icbm2tal transformation developed by Lancaster et al.\u00a0( ) and then used for the meta\u2010analysis. In total, data from 1,351 subjects (692 for altruistic punishment and 659 for retaliatory punishment) were included in the analyses. The sample in altruistic SPP studies consisted of approximately 40% males and 60% females and had a mean age of 28\u2009years. The sample in retaliatory SPP studies consisted of approximately 50% males and 50% females and had a mean age of 23\u2009years. An overview of the studies included in this meta\u2010analysis is outlined in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nSummarized information of studies and experiments included in the meta\u2010analysis \n    \n\n###  ALE   meta\u2010analysis \n  \nWe used the GingerALE software, V3.0.2 ( , RRID:SCR_014921) to conduct coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analyses using the revised activation\u2010likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm (Turkeltaub et al.,\u00a0 ) of Eickhoff et al. ( ). This method uses foci from different studies to calculate a probabilistic map of activations that is compared against an expected null spatial distribution at the voxel\u2010level. The ALE algorithm first creates 3D images for each group of pooled foci computed using the input foci, a mask defining the outer limit of MNI space, and a Gaussian distribution with a Full\u2010Width Half\u2010Maximum (FWHM) calculated from the experiments' sample size. The ensuing images are modeled activation (MA) maps containing voxel\u2010wise ALE scores. These maps are then combined to create the ALE image that represents the functional overlap between sets of foci at each voxel. This overlap has to occur above chance level in order to represent true between\u2010experiment convergence. Last, the convergence of foci is tested by comparing the ALE scores against the null\u2010hypothesis of random spatial brain activations (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Turkeltaub et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWe ran five separate meta\u2010analyses: (a) one global analysis for SPP across all subjects and experiments combining altruistic and retaliatory SPP, (b) one global analysis on altruistic SPP alone combining reject > accept and unfair > fair contrasts, (c) one global analysis for retaliatory SPP alone combining retaliation > no retaliation and high provocation > low provocation contrasts, (d) one conjunction analysis to determine the functional convergence between altruistic and retaliatory SPP, and (e) one contrast analysis to determine differences in the convergence between altruistic and retaliatory SPP. Significance has been assessed using a cluster\u2010level family\u2010wise error (cFWE) correction set at   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with an uncorrected cluster\u2010forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and 5,000 permutations. The cluster extent threshold was determined automatically by the software. \n\nDue to the strong positive relationship between provocation and punishment (Camerer,\u00a0 ; Konzok et al.,\u00a0 ; Kr\u00e4mer et al.,\u00a0 ; Weidler, Habel, et al.,\u00a0 ), we combined the unfair > fair and the reject > accept experiments in the altruistic SPP analysis and the feedback phase and the decision phase experiments, as well as experiments not separating between the two phases, in the retaliatory SPP analysis. Consequently, while the analyses on altruistic SPP and retaliatory SPP do not capture brain activation related exclusively to the punishment execution, they are able to determine which brain regions are activated throughout the whole decision\u2010making process that might lead to punishment. With the same rationale, we ran the global analysis on SPP combining all contrasts. In particular, the altruistic SPP experiments (unfair > fair and reject > accept) were combined in one single experiment per study (altruistic SPP experiment) resulting in 24 altruistic SPP experiments. The same applies to retaliatory SPP (feedback phase, decision phase, feedback, and decision phase combined) resulting in 19 experiments. Therefore, the global analysis on SPP included 43 experiments. \n\nWe also attempted to separate between the feedback and the decision in both types of SPP in explorative analyses. As such, we investigated convergence in activation related to (6) the unfair > fair contrast and (7) the reject> accept contrast, which correspond, respectively, to the feedback phase and the decision phase in altruistic SPP. Similarly, we analyzed the (8) the feedback phase and (9) the decision phase contrasts in retaliatory SPP. Lastly, because the TAP is the most used paradigm to investigate retaliatory SPP, we ran a subanalysis on (10) retaliatory SPP including only the subset of studies using the TAP. Since the number of experiments included in these subanalyses (with the except of the unfair > fair analysis and the TAP analysis) does not meet the minimum requirements for performing an ALE meta\u2010analysis (see M\u00fcller et al.,\u00a0 ), these results should be interpreted with caution. The results for the subanalyses are available in Appendix\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Second\u2010party punishment \n  \nThe global meta\u2010analysis for SPP across all 1,351 subjects and 43 experiments revealed four clusters of consistent activity comprising (a) the left anterior insula/IFG, (b) the bilateral dACC/MCC and left SFG, (c) the right anterior insula/IFG, and (d) the right MFG/SFG (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nResults for the meta\u2010analysis on SPP \n      \nResults for the meta\u2010analysis on SPP. aI, anterior insula; aMCC, anterior midcingulate cortex; dACC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; L, left; MCC, midcingulate cortex; MFG, medial frontal gyrus; R, right; SFG, superior frontal gyrus \n  \n\n### Altruistic   SPP  \n  \nThe meta\u2010analysis for altruistic SPP (692 subjects, 30 experiments) revealed four clusters of consistent activity comprising (a) the bilateral dACC/aMCC and left SFG, (b) the left anterior insula/IFG, (c) the right anterior insula/IFG, and (d) the right MFG (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nResults for the meta\u2010analysis on altruistic SPP \n    \n\n### Retaliatory   SPP  \n  \nThe meta\u2010analysis for retaliatory SPP (659 subjects, 23 experiments) revealed one cluster of consistent activity strongly right lateralized in the posterior MCC (pMCC; Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nResults for the meta\u2010analysis on retaliatory SPP \n    \n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nThe conjunction analysis revealed no cluster of convergent activity between altruistic and retaliatory SPP. \n\n\n### Contrast analysis \n  \nAltruistic SPP in contrast to retaliatory SPP revealed more substantial convergence of activation in four clusters, including (a) the bilateral dACC/aMCC and SFG/MFG, (b) the right anterior insula/IFG, (c) the putamen and left anterior insula, and (d) the right MFG (Table\u00a0 ; Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nResults for the contrast analysis between altruistic SPP and retaliatory SPP \n      \nResults for the contrast analysis.

Further, we aimed to shed light on the network supporting SPP decision\u2010making and update previous findings on altruistic and retaliatory SPP. The conjunction analysis did not show significant convergent activation related to the two concepts. The global analysis, however, showed that SPP reliably recruited activation in the bilateral insula/IFG, the bilateral MCC/dACC, and the bilateral MFG/SFG. This network largely corresponds to regions activated by altruistic SPP but extends to the right pMCC as activated in retaliatory SPP. This is comparable with what reported by Puiu et al.\u00a0( ), who included retaliatory SPP tasks together with altruistic SPP and third\u2010party punishment tasks. \n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we did not find overlapping activation in the anterior insula/IFG and dACC/aMCC for altruistic and retaliatory SPP. Instead, the contrast analysis revealed that altruistic, compared with retaliatory SPP, showed more convergent activation in the cortical and subcortical regions involved in SPP. Retaliatory SPP tasks, on the other hand, revealed only one cluster located in a posterior portion of the right MCC showing more convergent activation compared with altruistic SPP tasks. Our findings support the assumption of specific and divergent neural networks which may underlie different motivations in SPP. Decision\u2010making in altruistic SPP, driven by the large conflict between the social norm of fairness and self\u2010interest, might require more cognitive resources to resolve the conflict between the two different motives and decide whether to execute the punishment (Sanfey et al.,\u00a0 ). In particular, the activation of the right dlPFC in altruistic and not in retaliatory SPP supports our hypothesis that this area activates specifically during altruistic SPP. We speculate that this may indicate overcoming self\u2010interest. In contrast, retaliatory SPP originates from a spiteful motivation, which is less cognitively demanding as there is less conflict to resolve, related to the punishment level to administer, but not concerning self\u2010interest. \n\nOur findings on altruistic SPP revealed a network that overlaps with previous meta\u2010analytic findings (Feng et al.,\u00a0 ; Gabay et al.,\u00a0 ; Zinchenko,\u00a0 ), in particular with regions mentioned in the two\u2010system model for punishing norm violations (Feng et al.,\u00a0 ). We found convergent activation in the anterior insula/IFG, which according to the two\u2010systems model, belongs to System 1 and is assumed to represent intuitive responses. Furthermore, we also found dACC/aMCC and MFG/SFG (bilateral dlPFC) activation, belonging to System 2, which is thought to manage conflict. The separate subanalyses on the feedback (unfair > fair) and the decision phase (reject > accept) showed that the whole network identified in the main analysis is active at the feedback phase level before the decision. This likely shows that the decision\u2010making process underlying altruistic SPP starts already with the provocation. However, this speculative assumption has yet to be investigated. The decision phase showed activation only in the left aI/IFG/putamen. Yet, the decision phase analysis was based on a limited number of experiments (nine), which might explain the lack of convergent activation in the other regions of the altruistic SPP network. \n\nCrucially, dACC/aMCC involvement was reported in previous meta\u2010analyses (Feng et al.,\u00a0 ; Gabay et al.,\u00a0 ), but not by Zinchenko\u00a0( ). This might be due to the heterogeneity of the studies that were included in the meta\u2010analysis and did not always involve resolving a cognitive conflict (UG, third\u2010party punishment game, criminal scenarios evaluation, and social rejection tasks). Our findings, however, support the involvement of the dACC/aMCC specifically in altruistic SPP. The dACC/aMCC is involved in regulating cognitive control by providing continuous updated account of cognitive demand based on changes in the situational complexity (Sheth et al.,\u00a0 ). This function allows the dACC/aMCC to guide reward\u2010based decision making, to predict task difficulty, and to monitor conflict. While not excluding other functions of the dACC/aMCC, a cognitive demanding conflict underlying the motivation in the altruistic SPP decision\u2010making would be in line with this convergent activation pattern in this region. We speculate in line with the two neuronal network model, that dACC/aMCC recruitment may be needed to monitor the conflict between unfair offers and self\u2010interest and to guide decision\u2010making in punishing unfairness. \n\nIn addition, we found recruitment of the putamen specifically in altruistic SPP compared with retaliatory SPP, which is in line with findings by Gabay et al.\u00a0( ). Given that the putamen is often involved in reward processing (Arsalidou, Vijayarajah, & Sharaev,\u00a0 ), the authors hypothesized that activation in this region might show a potential role of reward in altruistic SPP. As inherently rewarding, the possibility to punish experienced inequality likely supports this decision more than self\u2010interest. In other words, the motivation to re\u2010establish the social norm by punishing unfairness should be rewarding enough to overcome self\u2010interest. For a successful conflict resolution, the decision process requires cognitive resources to evaluate the best between the two possible outcomes. However, the potential role of reward in altruistic SPP needs to be investigated in future studies involving rewards\u2010specific tasks manipulations. \n\nRetaliatory SPP yielded convergent activation in a more posterior portion of the MCC compared with that found in altruistic SPP. The pMCC is involved in multisensory orientation of the body in space in response to sensory stimuli such as pain, and more generally in the processing of motor and pain information (Vogt,\u00a0 ; Yu et al.,\u00a0 ). A Neurosynth search ( , RRID:SCR_006798) of the peak coordinate for retaliatory SPP indicates that this area associated with motor control and pain processing. While the meta\u2010analysis cannot disentangle specific functions during the punishment decision process, it is conceivable that the pMCC might be recruited in retaliatory SPP tasks to process the provocation stimuli and prepare a fast motor response without much rumination or cognitive demanding evaluation of the social context. In absence of a direct cost for the participant, the decision to punish would not require solving a conflict between the provocation and self\u2010interest and the punishment can be administered more directly, after solving only the conflict related to choosing a high or low punishment. If this role of the pMCC in retaliatory SPP were true, its activation might be mostly related to the feedback phase, where participants evaluate the provocation and prepare a response. Indeed, the subanalysis on the feedback phase indicates an activation of the pMCC in this phase. However, these results are based on a low number of experiments (nine), which is not considered reliable for drawing any robust conclusion. Future studies should aim at separating the feedback phase and the decision phase to pinpoint which regions support the response preparation and those recruited during the actual punishment selection. \n\nThe differential recruitment of the aMCC/dACC and pMCC in altruistic and retaliatory SPP might thus reflect differential motivation involved in the decision\u2010making processes underlying the two types of SPP, with a cognitive demanding conflict resolution motivation in altruistic SPP and spiteful motivation in retaliatory SPP. However, despite investigation of the cingulate subdivisions using different methodologies including electrical stimulation and high resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Caruana et al.,\u00a0 ; Dou et al.,\u00a0 ), the nomenclature of the different cingulate subdivisions remains heterogeneous and thus precludes a clear understanding each subdivision's specific role. The pMCC was the only finding in the retaliatory SPP analysis. This might be due to the heterogeneity of the studies included which can lead to a lot of variability in regions activated across experiments. We only included 19 studies on retaliatory SPP in our meta\u2010analysis reporting results of different tasks (e.g., TAP, PSAP), contrasts, and different punishment modalities (e.g., money subtraction, noise blasts). More research is needed to reliably characterize the neural architecture of retaliatory SPP, for instance by mechanistically parsing out provocation from decision phases and by distinguishing among different punishment modalities and types of tasks. Our analyses showed activation of other areas during the feedback phase that did not emerge in the main analysis such as the aI/IFG, also active in altruistic SPP, as well as the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the precentral gyrus (PreCG). However, no region emerged from the analysis on the decision phase, probably reflecting interindividual differences in the decision to punish. It is important to bear in mind the limited number of experiments included in these analyses, which thus limits the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, it is likely that a more extended network than just the pMCC is consistently involved in retaliatory SPP. For instance, previous meta\u2010analytic findings on aggression (Wong et al.,\u00a0 ) found convergent activation in the left postcentral gyrus. The postcentral gyrus is part of the somatosensory network (Kropf, Syan, Minuzzi, & Frey,\u00a0 ) and reflects action execution (Wong et al.,\u00a0 ). However, in their meta\u2010analysis they only included 13 studies as opposed to the 19 studies included in the present work. The lack of convergent activation in this area in our meta\u2010analysis might indicate that this region is differently recruited during retaliatory SPP tasks, depending on heterogeneous decision\u2010making processes, which might be modulated by other brain areas as for example, the cerebellum as suggested by Klaus and Schutter\u00a0( ). The results from the subanalysis including only the TAP studies (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ) further suggests that tasks heterogeneity in retaliatory SPP may be responsible for convergent activation in the pMCC only. Indeed, the TAP studies did not show activation in the pMCC but in the bilateral STG and in the left precentral gyrus, which could reflect task\u2010specific patterns. The STG has been associated with looming threat (Blair et al.,\u00a0 ), while the precentral gyrus is considered a motor mirror region (Gatti et al.,\u00a0 ; Leslie, Johnson\u2010Frey, & Grafton,\u00a0 ). \n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, the ALE algorithm is currently not accounting for variables differing between studies that might influence the results, such as scanning or data\u2010analysis parameters. The algorithm does, however, account for between\u2010studies variability by estimating the degree of spatial uncertainty in each experiment (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). Second, we included both feedback phase and decision phase contrasts. This results in the inclusion of decision\u2010making processes in response to provocations that not always end up in a punishment and may thus to a certain degree potentially include decisions to avoid punishing the opponent. The number of studies and experiments available in the literature restricts the possibility to separately analyze with sufficient power the experiments, precluding reliable and robust separate computations of unfair > fair and reject > accept in altruistic SPP and feedback phase and decision phase in retaliatory punishment. Future studies should make a distinction between the two phases and the decision\u2010processes that lead to punishment and those that do not. Lastly, the categorization of the paradigms into altruistic and retaliatory scenarios may be artificial to a certain degree, as the differences in the decision process are very subtle and may in certain situations even overlap, for instance in scenarios in which the rejection of a gain (altruistic) goes along with a high punishment for the other (retaliation). Additionally, the decision\u2010making processes underlying retaliatory or altruistic motivations may include several cognitive processes beyond the presented situation, for example, evaluation of the situation and strategic thinking about long\u2010term outcomes. There are some differences between the two types of paradigms that might explain different brain activation beyond the altruistic and retaliatory motivations. For instance, retaliatory paradigms involve an interactive competition, in which the game outcome determines whether participants win money and administer the punishment or lose and receive the punishment. The UG, instead, is a strategic bargaining paradigm with a fixed role for the participant, that can only accept or reject the offer. The participant can never propose an offer and has a fixed cost of the punishment (gaining no money). Thus, for a more detailed understanding and replication of the differences suggested by this meta\u2010analysis, experimental designs that directly differentiate between differently motivated decisions and the parallel assessment of the reason the participant relied on, would be optimal. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nOur findings show that SPP activates the anterior insula/IFG (detection and decoding of the norm violation), the MCC/dACC (integration of the salient information and selection of the appropriate response) and the dlPFC. The latter is likely primarily recruited in situations where a conflict needs to be resolved with suppression of self\u2010interest to implement the punishment (altruistic SPP). On the contrary, the pMCC is probably involved when a harming punishment comes at no direct cost for the participant (retaliatory SPP). With reduced conflict, the punishment may be channeled more directly. Our meta\u2010analysis integrates the previous findings on decision\u2010making in altruistic and retaliatory SPP. It also highlights that, despite of highly similar behavioral outcomes, different cognitive and emotional processes may underlie altruistic and retaliatory SPP. Our findings largely overlap with the norm violation model in the context of altruistic SPP and highlight the importance of clarifying the structural and functional subdivisions of the cingulate cortex, which seems to play a crucial role in differentiating the motivation supporting either altruistic or retaliatory SPP. These findings may drive future clinical studies aiming to understand which neural mechanisms are affected in pathological aggression and different SPP behaviors. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS \n  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION \n  \n Sara Boccadoro:   Designed the study, performed the database search, performed data analysis, interpretation, and wrote the manuscript.

However, neural activity peaks labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d in human neuroimaging studies investigating spatial orientation often lie significantly outside of the retrosplenial cortex proper. This has led to a large and anatomically heterogenous region being ascribed numerous roles in spatial orientation and navigation. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) investigations of spatial orientation and navigation and have identified a ventral-dorsal functional specialization within the posterior cingulate for   spatial encoding   vs.   spatial recall  . Generally, ventral portions of the posterior cingulate cortex were more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , i.e., passive viewing of scenes or active navigation without a demand to respond, perform a spatial computation, or localize oneself in the environment. Conversely, dorsal portions of the posterior cingulate cortex were more likely to be activated by cognitive demands to recall spatial information or to produce judgments of distance or direction to non-visible locations or landmarks. The greatly varying resting-state functional connectivity profiles of the ventral (centroids at MNI \u221222, \u221260, 6 and 20, \u221256, 6) and dorsal (centroid at MNI 4, \u221260, 28) posterior cingulate regions identified in the meta-analysis supported the conclusion that these regions, which would commonly be labeled as \u201cretrosplenial cortex,\u201d should be more appropriately referred to as distinct subregions of the posterior cingulate cortex. We suggest that future studies investigating the role of the retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortex in spatial tasks carefully localize activity in the context of these identifiable subregions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver a century ago, Korbinian Brodmann published an exhaustive cytological parcellation of the human cerebral cortex (Brodmann,  ); as a testament to his work, this parcellation is still commonly used across all neurological disciplines. Of particular interest in Brodmann\u2019s parcellation is the retrosplenial cortex (Brodmann\u2019s areas 26, 29, and 30), a small, enigmatic region in the human brain that Brodmann was only able to identify after delineating this region in lower animals, in which it is relatively larger and more easily identifiable (Brodmann,  , 124). In humans, the retrosplenial cortex occupies the small portion of the cingulate cortex that is immediately posterior to the most posterior region of the corpus callosum (i.e., the splenium). While at the time Brodmann was unsure of the significance of the retrosplenial cortex (and neighboring posterior cingulate areas 23 and 31; Brodmann,  , 123), more recently, this tiny region has been ascribed important functions involving emotion processing (Maddock,  ) and episodic memory (Spreng et al.,  ), with substantial literature reporting its critical role in spatial orientation and navigation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito,  ; Maguire,  ; Vann et al.,  ; Epstein et al.,  ). \n\nDespite a precise localization of the retrosplenial cortex in the human brain, the vast majority of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the role of this region in spatial cognition do not report results in the retrosplenial cortex proper. This is partially due to the fact that the retrosplenial cortex, as delineated by Vogt et al. ( ; Figure  ) is effectively too small to be studied with common fMRI voxel sizes (e.g., 3 mm isotropic) used for whole-brain imaging, resulting in many fMRI peaks labeled as \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d lying in the posterior cingulate cortex (Vogt et al.,  ). Therefore, while the anatomically-defined region retrosplenial cortex is quite small, the manner in which the label \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d is used spans a very large region of the posterior medial cortex with variable cytology (Maguire,  ; Vogt et al.,  ,  ) and functional connectivity (Bzdok et al.,  ). This includes the functionally-defined, scene-sensitive \u201cretrosplenial complex\u201d (Epstein,  ). \n  \nBrodmann\u2019s original depiction of the retrosplenial cortex   (A)  , which was intentionally overrepresented (Brodmann,  ). More modern illustrations based off the work by Morris et al. ( ) and Vogt et al. ( ) in panels   (B,C)  , respectively, depict a substantially humbler region. Brodmann\u2019s figures, originally published in 1910, are in the public domain. \n  \nAlthough the mislocalization of the retrosplenial cortex is somewhat egregious, it is not without precedence. Brodmann himself, in fact, intentionally overrepresented the size of the retrosplenial cortex in his original figures (Figure  ), and he noted this inaccuracy 16 pages after the figures (as it appears in the English translation by Gary). This large representation of the retrosplenial cortex also appeared in the Talairach atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), with the posterior border of the retrosplenial cortex reaching as far as the junction of the parietal-occipital fissure and the calcarine sulcus. This is in stark contrast to more modern cytological studies, which frequently confirm Brodmann\u2019s original localization (but not depiction) of the retrosplenial cortex as largely contained within the callosal sulcus and without the generous representation on the gyral surface (Figure  ; Morris et al.,  ; Vogt et al.,  ; Fatterpekar et al.,  ). \n\nWhile it is possible that a slight misrepresentation of an anatomically-defined region provides a more accurate representation of a functionally-defined region involved in spatial orientation and navigation, the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label has been used in human spatial cognition research far too liberally, including many areas of the posterior medial cortex far beyond the anatomical border of the retrosplenial cortex proper (Nasr et al.,  ; Marchette et al.,  ; Silson et al.,  ). Considering the wide variety of spatial orientation and navigation tasks producing activity in this large area of the human brain, it is likely it could be more accurately described as a collection of relatively distinct subregions, performing slightly different functions within the spatial cognition domain. Consistent with this assumption, we have recently identified a differential engagement of the ventral and dorsal portions of the posterior cingulate cortex while individuals performed a spatial memory task (Burles et al.,  ); we had identified that ventral regions were more involved in updating a mental representation of the environment, and more dorsal regions were involved in recalling the positions of unseen objects from that mental representation. These findings provided initial evidence of a simple encoding-recall specialization along the ventral-dorsal axis of the posterior cingulate and \u201cretrosplenial cortex.\u201d Here, we performed a meta-analysis of relevant fMRI studies to provide further evidence of a ventral-dorsal functional specialization of the posterior cingulate and neighboring cortex supporting the processes of encoding and recalling spatial information. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nTo identify relevant neuroimaging studies, we performed a literature search in PubMed identifying fMRI studies with human subjects investigating spatial orientation and mentioning retrosplenial or nearby regions in the posterior medial cortex. We ran the following conjunctive search: \n  \nretrosplenial OR (posterior cingulate) OR precuneus OR (medial parietal cortex) OR (posterior parietal cortex) OR ((parieto-occipital OR parietooccipital) and (sulcus OR fissure)) OR ((Brodmann Area OR BA) and (23 OR 26 OR 29 OR 30 OR 31)) \n\nAND \n  \n((spatial OR topographical OR place OR path OR scene) and (navigation OR memory OR recognition OR learning OR integration OR construction OR imagination OR orientation)) OR path integration OR dead reckoning OR cognitive map OR mental representation OR spatial configuration OR perspective taking \n\nAND \n  \nfMRI OR functional magnetic resonance imaging OR functional neuroimaging OR BOLD OR blood oxygen level dependent \n  \nThis conjunctive search produced 297 articles, which were subsequently filtered to only include the 61 research articles with healthy, adult subjects performing a spatial task while fMRI data were collected, with coordinates reported in the manuscript or supplementary materials. The references in five relevant review articles included in search results were mined, resulting in an additional 23 articles meeting these criteria included from 497 references. Finally, an additional seven articles known to the authors through personal communications with other researchers were included. The total sample of articles passing filtering was comprised of 91 articles. This search strategy was not intended to be exhaustive, but rather generate a sample that is adequately representative of the state of the cognitive neuroscience literature investigating human spatial orientation and navigation. \n\nFor each of these 91 articles, we attempted to classify BOLD contrasts as either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall  . Contrasts classified as   spatial encoding   were principally characterized by relatively more bottom-up or stimulus-driven BOLD activity. These included cases where participants were viewing or imagining visual stimuli, such as landmarks or scenes, or performing active navigation in a novel environment, without an explicit demand to perform a spatial computation or localize unseen landmarks in the environment. For instance, a functional localizer, contrasting BOLD activity while participants viewed scenes over BOLD activity while participants viewed faces or objects (Johnson et al.,  ; Sung et al.,  ) was classified as   spatial encoding  . These contrasts are commonly used to identify scene-sensitive retrosplenial and/or parahippocampal cortex and represent an easily classifiable contrast as the detected BOLD activity relates specifically to encoding scenes and has no demand to recall any spatial or navigational information. This category also included contrasts such as the one performed by Aguirre et al. ( ), subtracting BOLD activity while participants followed an endless, looping corridor from the activity evoked while participants were freely exploring a maze, and presumably encoding the locations of landmarks for a future navigation task. \n\nConversely, the BOLD contrasts identified as   spatial recall   were generally complementary to the   spatial encoding   category, in a manner similar to a classic encoding\u2014recall dichotomy. For example, in the aforementioned study by Aguirre et al. ( ), free exploration in a maze over a control condition was classified as   spatial encoding  ; a complementary contrast of a spatial navigation task (i.e., participants locating a target landmark using the shortest route possible) over a control task, would be classified as   spatial recall  . However, this category also included contrasts weighted more heavily towards spatial representations or judgments in addition to recall   per se  . For instance, Rosenbaum et al. ( ) asked participants to perform proximity judgments between familiar landmarks in downtown Toronto. In this study, landmarks were presented to participants via text, resulting in participants relying strongly on their capacity to recall complex, well-learned, spatial information, and use it to perform a spatial computation, i.e., the proximity judgment. \n\nFrom the 91 articles passed on to classification, we classified 38 contrasts as   spatial encoding  , and 76 contrasts as   spatial recall   (Supplementary Table S1). We did not classify multiple non-orthogonal contrasts from a single study, and instead selected the contrast most representative of either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall  , leaving non-orthogonal contrasts unclassified. We then passed all coordinates from classified contrasts to a Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA; Wager et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) \n  \nWe first converted all peak coordinates reported in Talairach space to MNI space (Lancaster et al.,  ), and imported them into NeuroElf  to perform an MKDA. The coordinates were then smoothed using a 12-mm Gaussian kernel and combined to form a single map for each classified contrast, ensuring that contrasts reporting more coordinates (from utilizing more liberal statistical thresholds, for instance) were not overrepresented. These maps were weighted by the square root of the sample size reported in the study. We then compared the z-transformed proportion of voxels differentially and commonly involved in   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall  . To detect differential engagement, we compared the contrast of   spatial encoding vs. spatial recall   against an empirical null distribution generated from label permutation. To detect common engagement, we performed a conjunction from independent activations of   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   each compared against a spatial scrambling null distribution. In all cases 5000 simulation iterations were performed within an 8385 voxel retrosplenial and posterior cingulate mask, with a 2 mm resolution. The resulting statistical map was thresholded at   p   < 0.001. \n\n\n### Subregion Functional Connectivity Characterization \n  \nTo characterize the differences between subregions identified in the MKDA, we contrasted the resting-state functional connectivity profile of regions more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding   contrasts vs.   spatial recall   contrasts and vice-versa. We utilized preprocessed resting state functional connectivity data from 38 unrelated, young adult participants of the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al.,  ; Glasser et al.,  ). We performed additional preprocessing on our resting state data using the CONN toolbox (v17.f ), modeling head motion with 24 parameters, and regressing out signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (Behzadi et al.,  ), and temporally bandpass filtering between 0.008 Hz and 0.09 Hz. We generated seed regions of equivalent spatial extent from the thresholded results of the MKDA, eroding large clusters of equivalent values by smoothing and re-thresholding. Then, we calculated the difference in functional connectivity displayed by these two subregions by calculating the difference in seed-to-ROI temporal correlation coefficients for 131 ROIs included in CONN\u2019s default atlas, using a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.001. For the connectivity analyses, Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient values were used for comparison, and the reverse transform was applied to return connectivity coefficients to   r   values for ease of interpretation. This research study was approved by the local research ethics board (CHREB-22848). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Retrosplenial Cortex \n  \nFrom all 91 articles passing initial filtering, we identified 143 coordinates from 32 articles with a label including \u201cretrosplenial cortex.\u201d Figure   depicts a histogram of coordinate locations projected into the sagittal plane. Approximately 10% of reported coordinates lie within the callosal sulcus, i.e., the retrosplenial cortex as defined by Vogt et al. ( ). \n  \nPanel   (A)   depicts the frequency at which a coordinate label included \u201cRetrosplenial Cortex\u201d appeared within 2 mm of any given MNI Y, Z position, projected onto an MNI standard brain at   x   = 8 mm. Panel   (B)   depicts the volume of interest generated to encompass the brain tissue commonly referred to as \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d in the spatial cognition literature. \n  \n\n### Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis \n  \nWe performed an MKDA to identify regions within the retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate (Figure  ) that are preferentially involved in   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall  . Contrasts classified as   spatial encoding   were generally characterized by stimulus-driven activity in which participants viewed scenes or explored virtual environments, with no explicit demand to localize themselves or unseen landmarks. Contrasts classified as   spatial recall   included those with demands to recall the location of, or route to, landmarks in familiar environments, as well as contrasts that track environmental properties or knowledge (e.g., parametric contrasts with navigational performance or goal proximity). As shown in Figure  , the MKDA with a threshold of   p   < 0.001 revealed that   spatial encoding   was more likely to activate ventrolateral portions of the posterior cingulate (MNI centroids at \u221222, \u221260, 6; 333 voxels, and 20, \u221256, 6; 70 voxels), whereas   spatial recall   was more likely to activate dorsomedial portions of the posterior cingulate (MNI centroid 4, \u221260, 28; 847 voxels). These findings closely parallel the results reported in our previous study (Burles et al.,  ). A conjunction analysis did not detect any voxels engaged in both   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   (peak   t   = 3.719,   p   = 0.002062 at MNI \u221214, \u221260, 14). \n  \nMultilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) results depicting regions more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding   (red/yellow) and   spatial recall   (blue/green). Panels   (A\u2013C)   are displayed at MNI 8, \u221253, 5, color range bounds represent uncorrected thresholds of   p   < 0.01 at   t   = 2.69 and   p   < 0.001 at   t   = 3.50 in an 8385-voxel region of interest (Figure  ). Panel   (D)   displays a volumetric depiction of the significant clusters at   p   < 0.001. \n  \n\n### Subregion Functional Connectivity Characterization \n  \nFrom the results of the MKDA, we selected the ventro-lateral clusters totaling 403-voxels more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , and a dorso-medial cluster of 408 voxels more likely to be activated by   spatial recall   as seeds for a resting state functional connectivity analysis. Contrasting the functional connectivity profiles of these regions revealed significant differences across the brain, detailed in Supplementary Table S2. Across the 132 brain regions tested, the ventro-lateral and dorso-medial posterior cingulate seeds displayed significantly (  p   < 0.001) different connectivity patterns with 69 regions (i.e., 52% of tested regions). The ventro-lateral   spatial encoding   seed displayed significantly more positive functional connectivity with numerous occipital, lateral parietal, and ventral temporal regions. The dorso-medial   spatial recall   seed, on the other hand, was more positively functionally connected to the posterior cingulate, as well as the frontal pole and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (see Figure  ). \n  \nPanel   (A)   depicts the difference in functional connectivity between the ventro-lateral posterior cingulate seeds more associated with   spatial encoding  , and the dorso-medial posterior cingulate seed more associated with   spatial recall  . Highlighted regions display significantly different functional connectivity profiles at   p   < 0.001.   N   = 38. Panel   (B)   displays grouped histograms of the differences in functional connectivity; red highlighting for more positive functional connectivity with the   spatial encoding   seeds, and blue for more positive functional connectivity with the   spatial recall   seed. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the spatial cognition literature, the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label is used quite liberally for brain regions lying posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Even by Brodmann\u2019s original, overdrawn depiction, a substantial number of MRI peaks labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d drawn from the spatial orientation literature lie unequivocally outside of this anatomical region. It is likely that some of the \u201cleaking\u201d of the retrosplenial cortex into the posterior cingulate is not simply due to the rather large representation of the retrosplenial cortex in Brodmann\u2019s work, or the Talairach atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), but also due to the long history of spatial orientation research in rodents. Rodents lack a clear homologous region to the human posterior cingulate (i.e., BA 23 and 31), and instead boast an expansive retrosplenial cortex (Vogt and Peters,  ). The human retrosplenial cortex label is applied in a manner that is potentially justifiable as functionally homologous to the rodent retrosplenial cortex, if not anatomically homologous. \n\nWhile this could be shrugged off as a simple case of difference in nomenclature, we would argue that the lack of specificity in the use of the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label actively impedes generating a clear and precise understanding of how this region supports the cognitive processes involved in spatial orientation and navigation in humans. In the present study, we provided evidence that the large region that is commonly labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d displays a relevant subregion specialization. We classified 114 contrasts from 91 articles as either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall   and identified that within the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d (more appropriately labeled as the posterior cingulate), ventral portions were more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , and dorsal portions more likely to be activated by   spatial recall  . \n\nThese findings are supported by a wide variety of previous research that have identified differences in cytology, as well as differences in functional and structural connectivity within this area (Vogt et al.,  ; Hagmann et al.,  ; Zhang and Li,  ; Bzdok et al.,  ; Silson et al.,  ; Burles et al.,  ), supporting the interpretation that the identified regions are involved in somewhat different cognitive processes. Indeed, we detected markedly different resting state functional connectivity profiles between the ventro-lateral,   spatial encoding  , cluster and the dorso-medial,   spatial recall  , cluster. The   spatial encoding   seeds were centered upon lateral portions of the anterior bank of the common trunk of the parietal-occipital fissure and calcarine sulcus, immediately ventral to where they join. This region displayed more positive functional connectivity coefficients with many ventral-stream, \u201cspatial context\u201d regions, such as the fusiform and lingual gyri (Milner and Goodale,  ), solidifying its characterization a relatively more involved in bottom-up or lower level perceptual processing and passive updating. In contrast, the   spatial recall   seed was centered 2 cm dorsal to the   spatial encoding   seeds, and displayed relatively greater resting state functional connectivity with regions commonly implicated in spatial manipulation, as well as spatial and episodic memory, such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus and frontal pole (Maddock et al.,  ; Okuda et al.,  ; Ridderinkhof et al.,  ; Wagner et al.,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Addis et al.,  ). \n\nWhile the ventral\u2014dorsal distinction between these subregions was distinct, the   spatial encoding   clusters occupied a relatively more lateral position, deeply tucked within the parietal-occipital fissure. This localization is consistent with previous work by Silson et al. ( ), who localized the scene-sensitive region of the medial parietal cortex as within the parietal-occipital fissure, immediately dorsal to the junction with the calcarine sulcus. This region was characterized by a strong contralateral visual field bias, a property shared with other scene-sensitive cortex (i.e., the occipital and parahippocampal place areas). However, Silson et al. ( ) also described a region immediately anterior and medial to the functionally-localized scene-selective cortex, and noted this region was relatively less scene-sensitive and displayed relatively lower functional connectivity with the posterior parahippocampal place area and occipital place area, but relatively greater functional connectivity with the precuneus, superior frontal, and orbitofrontal cortex. The authors suggest that these regions may constitute partially different scene-processing networks, as proposed by Baldassano et al. ( ). In this paradigm, more lateral scene-sensitive would be relatively more involved in processing visual features, whereas more medial and anterior cortex, approaching or including the retrosplenial cortex proper, appear to be more strongly integrated with the hippocampus and potentially involved in navigation or more general episodic memory processes. Notably, the present meta-analysis did not appear to be sensitive to this region, but this may explain why the   spatial encoding   clusters were sequestered to the lateral portions of the parieto-occipital fissure, as more medial and anterior regions may be involved in processes that are poorly characterized by the   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   paradigm we adopted. \n\nIn conclusion, we believe that the identification of detectable subregions within the posterior cingulate warrants a more precise and nuanced manner in which we discuss and report the results of neuroimaging findings in this region. While the number and location of the particular clusters identified in this meta-analysis likely do not represent   the   relevant subregions of this brain area, we do feel that some simple considerations can be taken into account to reduce the ambiguity of the retrosplenial cortex\u2019s position and role in cognition. First, we would suggest reserving the label \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d for peaks which reside within the callosal sulcus, or at least are closer to the callosal sulcus than the parietal-occipital fissure, especially at MNI z positions above +10 mm. Further, for the peaks in the posterior cingulate but in the vicinity of the retrosplenial cortex proper, it may be valuable to begin making the distinction between more ventral and dorsal regions; using the point at which the calcarine sulcus joins with the parietal-occipital fissure as an easily-identifiable landmark for differentiation, or at least reference, as our findings would indicate that regions ventral and significantly dorsal to this point may not be functionally homogenous. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nFB and GI conceived and designed the study.

Studies were grouped by food-cue modality as: i) tastes (8 studies); ii) odors (8 studies); and, iii) images (11 studies). Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was used to identify statistically reliable regional responses within each stimulation paradigm. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nBrain response distributions were distinctly different for the three stimulation modalities, corresponding to known differences in location of the respective primary and associative cortices. Visual stimulation induced the most robust and extensive responses. The left anterior insula was the only brain region reliably responding to all three stimulus categories. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThese findings suggest visual food-cue paradigm as promising candidate for imaging studies addressing the neural substrate of therapeutic interventions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObesity affects one-third of American adults and 17% of American children according to data from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES, 2009\u20132010). Obesity increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, arthritis, chronic renal failure and certain types of cancer ( ). The underlying cause of obesity, in the vast majority of afflicted persons, is inadequate regulation of food intake. Functional neuroimaging can identify brain structures involved in food craving, food perception and food intake. \n\nExperimental strategies most commonly used for functional neuroimaging studies of feeding-related neural systems contrast food cues with non-food cues or high-calorie food cues with low-calorie food cues ( , , , ). In-scanner stimulation methods vary, including: oral delivery of foods or flavored liquids; oro-nasal delivery of food odors; and, visual presentation of food images. These and other methodological variations have contributed to significant between-study variability in the neural systems identified by these studies. Structures implicated in food-intake regulation by functional neuroimaging are numerous, including: anterior insula, inferior frontal and orbitofrontal cortex, medial temporal cortex (amygdala and parahippocampus), nucleus accumbens, and higher-order visual cortex ( ). While an extensive constellation of regions likely is required for the complex experiences of food craving, food seeking and food consumption/enjoyment, the collective neuroimaging literature fails to identify strong candidates as regional biomarkers for therapeutic trials. \n\nCoordinate-based meta-analysis is a widely used tool for computing between-study concordance among functional neuroimaging studies, with activation likelihood estimate (ALE) being the most widely applied technique ( , , ). (For a partial listing of peer-reviewed ALE meta-analyses, see  ). Meta-analysis has been applied successfully to the food-cue neuroimaging literature by several investigative teams. A non-quantitative metaanalytic approach (employing visual inspection of plotted coordinates) was applied by Small and Prescott ( ) to identify orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and cingulate as common responses to olfactory and gustatory food cues. Quantitative meta-analysis (ALE) was used by van der Laan et al. ( ) to assess convergence of neural responses to visual food cues (contrasted with nonfood visual cues) and reported consistent activations in the posterior fusiform gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. Similarly, Tang et al. ( ) performed an ALE meta-analysis of studies presenting visual food cues (contrasted with non-food items) in healthy normal weight participants. Convergent activation was identified in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior and middle insula, amygdala, parahippocampus, precuneus, postcentral gyrus, and visual cortex (fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyri). Veldhuizen et al. ( ) performed an ALE meta-analysis of gustatory food cues and found significantly convergent activation in anterior and mid-dorsal insula, parietal operculum, postcentral gyrus, right medial orbitofrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and pre-genual anterior cinculate cortex. None of these meta-analyses, however, compared across the three dominant food-cue-delivery methods nor attempted to prioritize regions as targets (candidate biomarkers) for subsequent therapeutic trials. \n\nIn the present study, we performed three ALE meta-analysis, one for each of the most widely used food-cue-delivery paradigms. The primary purpose of this undertaking was to determine which food-cue paradigms produced the most robust and reliable results and, within that paradigm, to determine which region or regions held the most promise as regions of interest for neuroimaging studies of therapeutic interventions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nfMRI studies of visual, olfactory, and taste food stimuli were identified using on-line electronic databases, including PubMed ( ) and the BrainMap\u00ae database ( ) ( ). For PubMed, keywords searches included: \u201cfMRI\u201d; \u201cfood\u201d AND \u201cpictures\u201d; \u201codor\u201d AND \u201cfood\u201d; \u201cmilkshake\u201d; \u201cmeal\u201d and similar terms in various combinations. Additional studies were found by examining the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Inclusion criteria were: papers published in peer-reviewed, English-language journals; whole-brain, voxel-wise analysis of the primary data (i.e., no region-of-interest studies); results reported in standardized stereotactic coordinates; no results filtering other than by statistical significance. Retrieved studies fell into three categories, based upon food-cue delivery method: visual presentation of food images; oral delivery of foods or flavored liquids; and, oro-nasal delivery of food odors. In all included studies, healthy, non-obese subjects were fasted overnight at the time of scanning. \n\nOf fMRI studies using   visual food cues  , we restricted our sample to studies in which brain activations were induced by viewing pictures of high-caloric-content food (e.g., pizza, hamburgers, ice cream) as contrasted to viewing nonfood pictures (e.g., tools, scenery, flowers, animals) as the control state. Eleven publications reporting 12 experiments were identified which collectively reported 109 brain-activation locations across a total of 201 participants ( ). \n\nOf fMRI studies of   oral/gustatory food stimuli  , we restricted our sample to studies in which brain activations were induced by oral delivery of flavored foods (milkshake, chocolate, fat) as contrasted with tasting water or other tasteless solutions. Eight publications reporting 11 experiments were identified which collectively reported 89 brain-activation locations from a total of 146 participants ( ). \n\nOf fMRI studies of   olfactory food cues  , we restricted our sample to studies in which brain activations were induced by smelling food or appetizing odors (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, vegetables) as contrasted with odorless vapors or unpleasant odors. Eight publications reporting a total of eight experiments were identified which collectively reported 79 brain-activation locations from a total of 118 participants ( ). \n\nFor all experiments, results (peak coordinates) and associated meta-data (including experimental design) were entered into the BrainMap database ( ) using the Scribe software application ( ) to allow filtering of experimental parameters and metaanalytic pre-processing. Coordinates reported in MNI spaces were converted to Talairach coordinates using the Lancaster\u2019s transform ( ). Meta-analyses were performed using GingerALE 2.1, which included modifications to the ALE algorithm ( , ) described by Eickhoff et al. ( ) and Turkeltaub et al. ( ). Three meta-analysis were performed, one for each of the above-described groups of data. Each collection of studies/experiments was used to compute an ALE map that was statistically contrasted to an ALE null-distribution map. The null distribution map was derived from a permutation procedure and computed using the same number of experiments and reported coordinates as the experimental map. This map represented the null-hypothesis that there was a random spatial association between the results of the experiments. The ALE analysis implemented a random effects inference (i.e., the inference detects the above-chance concurrence between experiments, and not on the clustering of coordinates within experiments). Statistical significance was corrected for multiple comparisons. ALE maps were thresholded at P<0.05 using the option false discovery rate (FDR) pN with an extent threshold greater than 200 mm . All ALE results were reported in Talairach space, and the candidate anatomical labels for these regions were determined using a validated, fully automated algorithm ( ). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nContrasting food pictures with nonfood pictures yielded 11 clusters of significant convergence ( ,  ) with a total volume of 17,332 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0219. The most robust activation convergence was in higher-order visual cortex (right fusiform gyrus), in keeping with the visual nature of the stimuli. Additional lateralized convergent activations were observed in the left insula, right postcentral gyrus, right precuneus, left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus and left hippocampus. Bilateral convergent activations were observed in the fusiform gyrus, declive, parahippocampus and superior temporal gyrus. \n\nContrasting food tastes with tasteless solutions produced 14 significant ALE clusters ( ,  ) summing a volume of 13,332 mm  and a maximum ALE value of 0.0193. The most robust activation convergence was in the insula, bilaterally, in the presumed location of primary gustatory cortex. Strong activations were also observed in the region of the sensorimotor mouth representation, likely reflecting stimulation of the oral mucosa and manipulation of the food in the mouth. Additionally, the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, caudate, claustrum, insula, medial frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, thalamus and lentiform nucleus were activated. The majority of ALE clusters showed bilateral activations. \n\nContrasting food odors or non-food appetizing odors with odorless stimuli or unpleasant odors produced 7 significant ALE clusters with a total volume of 11,981 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0176 (  and  ). The inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula were the regions of most extensive and robust activation convergence, in the region of primary olfactory cortex. Other strong activations included amygdala and parahippocampus, regions with known olfactory projections. \n\nThe insula and parahippocampus were activated by both olfactory and taste food cues ( ). The insula and inferior frontal gyrus were commonly activated by olfactory and visual stimulation ( ). The insula was activated by both taste and visual presentation of food cues ( ). The left anterior insula was the only structure that was commonly activated by all three modalities ( ). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nQuantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to compare the collective findings of the three food-cue paradigms most extensively applied in functional neuroimaging studies of the neural systems engaged in food-intake regulation. Brain-response distributions were distinctly different for each of the three modalities, corresponding to known differences in the locations of the respective primary and associative cortices. Responses in (and around) primary olfactory and gustatory cortex were observed for odor and taste stimuli, respectively. The most extensive and statistically reliable food-cue-specific responses, however, were observed in higher-order visual cortex (fusiform gyrus), rather than in brain regions more commonly associated with the hedonic properties of food or appetite regulation. The anterior insula \u2013 in the region of primary gustatory cortex \u2013 was the only brain region to demonstrate significant responses to all three stimulus-delivery modalities. \n\n### Responses to Visual Food Cues \n  \nMeta-analysis of neural responses to visual food cues gave the most robustly convergent responses as determined both by peak statistical significant (ALE value) and by the volume of brain exhibiting a significant response ( ). When using visual food cues as stimuli, the regions showing the most reliable and significant activation lay within the visual system proper (occipital lobe), rather than in regions more traditionally regarded as involved in food-appetite regulation. Specifically, the region most strongly activated was the fusiform gyrus, which is a component of a nonretinotopic, high-level object-representation network. What is particularly striking about this activation is that all included studies used familiar, visually complex, nonfood objects as control stimuli, so the intense activation cannot be attributed to differential stimulus complexity or other irrelevant attributes. Rather, this finding argues strong that food images are \u201cpop-out\u201d stimuli, that reliably evoke significantly more intense and spatially extensive, obligatory processing than non-food images ( ). A similar effect is observed, for example, with familiar faces ( ). \n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, a species\u2019 survival depends on its ability to find food and to rapidly and reliably identify potentially edible items. Evolutionarily early species (e.g., aquatic species) rely almost entirely on chemosensation (taste) to detect and localize food. On land, olfaction rapidly evolved into the dominant modality for food detection and remains so for most species. Many primate species, including humans, have highly evolved visual systems. For most primates, visual search is a far more effective means of discovering food than olfaction or taste ( , ). Thus, it is not surprising that the visual system proved so effective at producing food-specific responses, i.e., at discriminating food from non-food items, in human subjects. What is, perhaps, more surprising is that the strongest visually induced food-specific responses were within higher-order visual cortex (object-recognition regions), rather than in regions more specific to eating. The robustness of the responses of visual regions to food cues, however, should not be construed as indicting that the visual system is solely involved in food detection. \n\nThe sight of food evokes physiological, emotional and cognitive responses ( ). Visual perception of food cues prepares the body for food ingestion, an anticipatory physiological response called the \u201ccephalic phase\u201d of eating ( ). The consequent emotional responses enhance the desire to ingest food ( ), and triggers pleasure, which has been proposed as a biological mechanism evolved to encourage survival behaviors ( ). In addition, food cues evoke cognitive processes, such as memory retrieval and hedonic evaluation, based on previous experiences with food ( ). Exposure to food cues can trigger cognitive processes such as selfregulation ( ) or overeating due to the override of satiety signals ( ) by the food cues. \n\n\n### Responses to Taste and Odor Food Cues \n  \nOral stimulation with foods or flavored liquids also gave very robust and extensive convergent activations across experiments ( ). The most robust responses were in the anterior insula, bilaterally, that is, in the primary gustatory cortex. Strong responses were also observed in sensorimotor cortices (in regions representing the mouth), as well as in subcortical motor-control regions (caudate head). These likely reflect both the stimulation of oral mucosa by food/liquid contact and manipulation of the food substances by the tongue, and oropharynx. Emotional, mnemonic and attention-related regions (amygdala, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate) were also activated, likely reflecting hedonic aspects of food ingestion. \n\nOdors also induced highly significant and extensive convergent activations ( ), including the inferior frontal gyrus (prepiriform cortex), amydala and parahippocampus (piriform cortex) and anterior insula bilaterally. The role of these regions in olfaction is well established. By comparison to visual food cues, it should be noted that the most commonly used control stimuli for taste and odor stimuli are the absence of an effective stimulus (i.e. tasteless or odorless substances), while visual control stimuli were highly effective stimuli (i.e., non-food pictures.) \n\n\n### Convergent Responses Across Food-Cue Modalities \n  \nAnatomical convergence of gustatory and olfactory food-cue responses ( ) in insula, parahippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex is not surprising. Primary gustatory cortex (anterior insula and frontal operculum) and primary olfactory cortex (amygdala, uncus, parahippocampus) are adjacent to one another and are mutually connected functionally and anatomically. The co-activation of the anterior insula by olfactory and gustatory food cues stimuli is consistent with the presence of projections from the olfactory neurons from oral cavity and afferents from the gut to the anterior insula ( ). However, gustatory and olfactory stimulus paradigms likely do not recruit fully independent brain networks because of the retronasal olfaction pathway by which there is a perception of odors emanating from the oral cavity during food ingestion. A previous meta-analysis of uni-modal gustatory stimulation studies was performed by Veldhuizen et al. ( ) demonstrating the engagement of insula on pure gustatory stimulation, indicating that true insular activation was induced by all three types of food cues. \n\nAnatomical convergence of visual responses with olfactory response in orbitofrontal cortex ( ) and with both olfactory and gustatory ( ) in anterior insula is more striking and pragmatically promising. Although anatomical projections from the fusiform gyrus to the anterior insula has not yet been reported, reliable co-activation (as observed here) implies at least indirect connectivity ( , ). This suggests that anterior insula likely is a hub region via which visual stimuli (and other modalities) induce physiological and psychological responses to food. \n\nThe anterior insula is known to engage in a wide range of tasks, including attention, memory, interoception, emotion, olfaction and gustation ( ). Functional connectivity studies ( ) showed that the anterior insula is part of a neural network of reward circuitry that included the thalamus, caudate, among others ( ). Moreover, the left anterior insula is involved in different types of craving types, such as smoking, cocaine, sexual arousal, drug use, and gambling ( , , , , , ). In addition, it has been published that lesion of the insular cortex leads to recovery of nicotine addiction ( ), suggesting that the insula is a key brain structure implicated in (food) craving-reward, processing and modulation of hedonic response, beyond food sensory stimuli integration. Furthermore, our findings identified the left anterior insula as opposed to the whole insula. Taken together, we speculate that overeating and obesity may be a result of dysfunction of craving-reward circuitry, sharing a common pathway with addiction. \n\n\n### The Visual Food-Cue Paradigm: Strengths and Opportunities \n  \nOf the three most widely used food-cue paradigms, visual presentation is by far the simplest to implement. MRI-compatible visual-display hardware and software for stimulus delivery and experiment management are commercially available from numerous vendors. Picture stimuli are readily created and can be digitally stored and shared. Digital pictures can be presented for durations as brief and at repetition rates as rapid as desired, without being impeded by stimulus-delivery mechanics. These characteristics allow picture-based food-cue experiments to be readily implemented for clinical trials and to exploit ongoing advances in fMRI experimental design and analysis strategies, including event-related designs. Further, the occipital lobe (lingual gyrus) is far less prone to susceptibility artifacts than the medial temporal lobe and inferior frontal brain regions recruited by taste and odor stimuli, simplifying fMRI data acquisition and analysis. \n\nDelivery of taste stimuli is far more complex, requiring calibrated solutions to be compounded and delivered into the mouth of the subject, typically through flexible tubes held between the lips. Tasting the solution, swallowing, rinsing the mouth and repeating with an alternate taste or control substance is an inherently slow process, which limits the rate of data acquisition and the range of experimental-design possibilities. Oral delivery of foods and flavored liquids also introduces the possibility of in-scanner aspiration, a risk not entailed with other food-cue stimulus modalities. While imaging studies using oral delivery of food cues were certainly required to map the neural populations recruited by food intake, it is less clear that this delivery modality is well suited for the transition to therapeutic trials using functional imaging to study mechanisms of action and as potential neural predictors of therapeutic outcome. \n\nOdor stimulus delivery is yet more complicated, requiring a ventilation system capable of delivering odor-bearing gases rapidly and at calibrated concentrations and of equally rapidly removing the odorants without detectible residue. Such systems are not commercially available and must be constructed in-house. This makes them poorly suited for therapeutic trials. \n\nCollectively, present results and the practicalities of stimulus delivery and experimental design argue strongly for the use of visual food-cue paradigms when studying neural responses to potential therapies. This would apply both to studies exploring the neural mechanisms of action of pharmacologic, behavioral or surgical therapies and to studies using imaging as a rapid neural biomarker to predict longer-term therapeutic outcomes. Visual-food-cueresponsive regions in lingual/fusiform gyrus, anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex all offer promising candidate regions of interest. \n\n\n\n## Limitations of this study \n  \nThere are a number of limitations associated with the data and methodology of this study, which should be considered when interpreting our results. First, the available number of publications included in these meta-analyses is relatively small, which necessitated inclusion of heterogeneous stimulation paradigms (such as type of food and duration of exposure), imageacquisition protocols and image-analysis methods, among others. Second, the ALE analysis algorithm did not account for the statistical significance or spatial extent of the included responses. Finally, to our surprise, none of the three meta-analyses revealed activation in the hypothalamus, which has been strongly implicated in satiety. Further, only one of the studies included in these three meta-analyses reported hypothalamic activation. Duration of preimaging fasting proved not to be an explanatory factor. The most likely explanation is that the hypothalamus is a small structure located in a region of high magnetic susceptibility, limiting the detectability of neural responses when using fMRI. Studies that have reported robust hypothalamic responses ( , ) have generally used acquisition protocols customized for this purpose. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe results of the visual food cues meta-analysis suggested that this paradigm is a simple and robust tool to probe the neural mechanisms involved in eating behavior. Our results support the notion that the anterior insula plays an important role in craving-reward processing and modulation of hedonic response, likely beyond food stimuli integration. Future fMRI studies could probe the left anterior insula and fusiform gyrus to determine whether it plays a role in eating behavior, eating disorders, obesity and diabetes. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 4007379, "text_md5": "c3c3711d31f91b7f1e477b21134bf1a8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 96], "journal": [97, 120], "publication_year": [122, 126], "title": [137, 247], "keywords": [261, 261], "abstract": [274, 1631], "body": [1640, 24697]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 24174404, "doi": "10.1002/oby.20659", "pmcid": "4007379", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007379", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4007379"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007379\">4007379</a>", "list_title": "PMC4007379  Neural Bases Of Food Perception: Coordinate-Based Meta-Analyses Of Neuroimaging Studies In Multiple Modalities"}

NEURAL CORRELATES OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN PSYCHOSIS RISK AND ONSET \u2013 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FMRI STUDIES\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nBehavioural findings suggest that the emotion processing abnormalities typically observed in established schizophrenia are already present in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Evidence has been less consistent in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRp). While several studies have reported unaltered behavioural performance on emotion identification in people at CHRp compared to healthy controls, some studies have shown poorer negative emotion recognition. A growing number of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies have investigated brain response to emotion processing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes in FEP patients and CHRp individuals. Despite the marked expansion of this field over the last two decades, to date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has attempted to synthesise the evidence on the neural bases of emotion processing in these groups as potential markers of psychosis vulnerability and expression. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched for published English-language articles applying an emotion processing task during fMRI in a FEP and/or a CHRp sample compared to healthy controls. References of included papers were also screened. For CHRp studies, only those including participants by the basic or attenuated symptom presentation criteria were included. \n\nIndividual study methodology and results were extracted and systematically reviewed. In addition, at present, statistical parametric mapping contrast maps (\u2018T-maps\u2019) are being collected from study authors and will be meta-analysed using the Seed-based d Mapping method. The contrasts meta-analysed will be the ones most commonly reported in the studies identified, i.e., of all emotion over comparison conditions and of negative emotion over neutral conditions. These will be meta-analysed separately, as behavioural evidence suggests that emotion recognition performance in these populations might be valence specific. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor the systematic review, 4,389 papers were identified through the search. 19 relevant fMRI papers were identified and their references were screened. 17 articles were included after full-text screening. Six out of twelve fMRI studies in the FEP population reported lower brain activation to emotion processing tasks compared to healthy controls. Four articles reported region-specific hyper- and hypoactivations and two studies found no significant difference. Of the seven studies in the CHRp population, one study reported lower brain response to emotion relative to healthy controls, two studies found hyperactivations, one study found region-specific increases and decreases, and two studies reported no significant difference. The most consistent finding across studies was lower amygdala activation in FEP participants (n=6). Conversely, in the CHRp population one article found an increase in amygdala response to emotion with age, consistently with one other article but contrasting with another study showing activity decreases in this region. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, no previous systematic review or meta-analysis has synthesised the fMRI findings of emotion processing in both people at CHRp and a FEP. The present systematic review shows that while more consistent hypoactivations are found in the FEP population, results are less consistent in CHRp studies. The undergoing meta-analysis will quantitatively synthesise these findings. Elucidating the nature of emotion processing aberrances in early psychosis may help understand the functional changes across both vulnerability and symptom emergence phases and inform molecular investigations into its underlying mechanisms. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"id": 7234314, "text_md5": "ed56904dd34dadcb3c81bdbb4bb536a8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 79], "journal": [80, 94], "publication_year": [96, 100], "title": [111, 242], "keywords": [256, 256], "abstract": [269, 4007], "body": [4016, 4016]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.693", "pmcid": "7234314", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234314", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234314"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234314\">7234314</a>", "list_title": "PMC7234314  T133.

However, trying to make money out of market forecasts can trigger all types of emotional responses. As the question on how investors decide remains controversial, we carried out an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have reported whole-brain analyses on subjects performing an investment task. We identified the ventral striatum, anterior insula, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex as being involved in this decision-making process. These regions are limbic-related structures which respond to reward, risk and emotional conflict. Our findings support the notion that investment choices are emotional decisions that take into account market information, individual preferences and beliefs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \n\u201cTo invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What\u2019s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework\u201d [ ] (p. ix). While there is no agreement on how emotions influence these decisions, there is a common understanding that expert investors are wired to weigh expected rewards and risks while making financial decisions. We believe that this kind of knowledge, acquired by a combination of formal training and on-the-job experience, is a trait of the brain. \n\nWhat is interesting about this decision-making process is that it is all about expectations learned from experience, by constantly readjusting these predictions to the actual results [ ]. A decision, whether risky or safe, begins with fluctuations of dopamine within the reward circuit [ ]. However, to come to a decision, this process must integrate information coming from reward circuits as well as brain regions involved in cognition [ ]. \n\nAlthough activity in dopaminergic brain areas has been shown to occur with both immediate and delayed rewards, in 2004, McClure et al. demonstrated that there are two distinct systems involved in choices between monetary reward options available at different moments in time [ ]. On the one hand, decisions that entail immediate rewards involve the ventral striatum, the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [ ], all of which are activated by the receipt of rewards [ ]. On the other hand, intertemporal choices of delayed rewards engage the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the parietal cortex [ ]. These latter areas of the brain are known to be implicated in the control of cognitive functions and goal-directed behavior, including the modulation of working memory information through rewards [ ] and the representation of task-reward associations [ ]. \n\nHow, then, do investors choose between different types of rewards? The answer lies in a common scale of values. Thus far, neuroimaging studies in humans have highlighted the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/OFC) as the key brain area for representing the subjective values of all reward types on a neural common scale and, to a much lesser extent, the ventral striatum [ ]. The most feasible explanation is that the vmPFC computes these values by trading off costs and benefits from the amygdala and the ventral striatum, respectively [ ]. Other areas, such as the anterior insula (AIns), engage with rewards by having a negative correlation with increasing anticipated monetary reward [ ] as well as a positive correlation, mainly with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when a decision conflict arises between options of competing value [ ]. Therefore, the brain appears to be equipped with a unified valuation network to compare between rewards. \n\nOn the contrary, risk is determined by the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are estimated by individual perceptions based on previous experiences. How these evaluated probabilities influence investors\u2019 decisions depends on the amount of information available (risk) or, rather, the information that is unknown to the investor (ambiguity). Several studies have associated activation between risk and ambiguity with distinct brain areas. Usually, risk activates the insula, the striatum and the parietal cortex, whereas ambiguity involves the lPFC, the mPFC, the cingulate cortex and the amygdala [ ]. \n\nAs opposed to rewards, the scientific community is still hesitant to draw strong conclusions about a unified neural system for evaluating decisions at all levels of uncertainty, despite the fact that the AIns is thought to encode changes in the amount of variability (risk) as well as risk prediction errors [ ]. In 2005, Hsu et al. suggested a common neural circuit which was positively activated in the amygdala and the OFC and negatively in the striatum as uncertainty increased [ ]. However, in 2019, FeldmanHall et al. ruled out these areas and stated that only the lPFC played a key role in processing high levels of uncertainty [ ], despite its correlation with individual ambiguity preferences [ ]. Nevertheless, all these areas are involved in the regulation of emotional responses, whether evoked consciously or automatically by the stimulus itself [ , ]. \n\nPsychological and neuroscientific research has emphasized that emotions play a role in decision-making, but it remains unclear how they influence risk processing and risk anticipation. Anticipatory effects in distinct neural circuits can impact financial choices [ ]. For instance, risky and safe investments are predicted by ventral striatum and anterior insula activation, respectively [ ]. It appears as if two parallel processes occur when a person makes an investment choice. On the emotional level, activity in the AIns assesses potential losses, while the thalamus can anticipate regret in the case of loss. On the cognitive level, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) evaluates risk by using the information provided by the AIns and the thalamus [ ]. To decide, the parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) must combine the information about risk with the expected reward obtained from those areas [ ]. \n\nIt is not fully known which neuronal circuits drive investment decisions. An unbiased way to understand what leads a person to make some investments and not others is by using the coordinates reported from all task-related neuroimaging studies to determine brain activation while investing. Our aim is to summarize the structures specialized in responding to investment decision-making by conducting an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis from individual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have reported whole-brain analysis results during an investment task. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nThis meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines [ ]. \n\n### 2.1. Eligibility Criteria \n  \nWe included studies that analyzed decision-making via investment tasks in healthy human adults without any other restrictions, such as language, publication date or text availability. Studies were eligible if they included fMRI as the only neuroimaging technique used and if they reported original data from whole-brain analysis results. We excluded all studies whose participants had suffered brain injuries, had any diseases or had disorders. We selected those studies that assessed investment decisions using financial assets. Furthermore, we restricted our selection to peer-reviewed articles. \n\n\n### 2.2. Information Sources and Search \n  \nStudies were identified in the following electronic databases: WOS, PubMed and PsycINFO. The only filters used were species (humans) and age (adults). The search terms included the following: investment decision making; investment risk taking; investments; financial decisions; financial risk taking; investors; traders; trading (decisions); stock market; stock exchange; portfolio; market bubbles; financial bubbles; brain; and fMRI (see   for the search strategy using the WOS database). \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Collection Process \n  \nInformation was collected using a spreadsheet under the following headlines: authors, title, year of publication, number of participants, sex, age, stimuli, aim, behavioral results, brain activation and coordinates. If a study reported Talairach coordinates, we transformed them into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the icbm2tal algorithm implemented in the GingerALE toolbox ( : available on 7 December 2020). \n\n\n### 2.4. Meta-Analysis of Brain Activation Coordinates \n  \nGingerALE (version 3.0.2) was used to run the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm [ , , ]. GingerALE meta-analytic software reveals concordant brain regions among the provided imaging studies, using random effects analysis to test the maximum activation probabilities against a null hypothesis of spatially independent activations. Cluster-level family-wise error thresholding at   p   < 0.01 was used to correct for multiple comparisons [ ] due to its increased power and compromise between sensitivity and specificity. An initial cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) was used, and 1000 permutations were applied. \n\n\n### 2.5. Visualization \n  \nWe used Caret v5.65 software to project the cortical results into a three-dimensional population-average landmark and surface (PALS-B12), using an enclosing voxel algorithm and fiducial mapping [ ]. The subcortical slices were generated with in-house Matlab scripts. The ALE values of the meta-analysis were projected with a threshold of 0.0025 for visualizing the trend. Black borders were used to delineate the surviving regions to multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nThe search on the WOS, PubMed and PsycINFO databases was conducted from October 2020 to November 2020 and provided a total of 495 studies. Once duplicates had been removed, 350 studies were screened on the basis of titles and abstracts. We discarded 322 articles, as they did not meet the eligibility criteria; 106 studies belonged to a different population (participants with disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, healthy elderly people, adolescents and children), 165 studies did not involve an investment task with financial assets, 28 studies had no original data, and 23 studies used other techniques (electroencephalography, positron emission tomography or transcranial stimulation). Then, the full text of the remaining 28 studies were examined, and 12 studies were excluded due to the fact that they did not report whole-brain analysis results. As a result of the selection criteria, 16 studies were selected for the meta-analysis ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Study Characteristics \n  \nAll articles employed some type of investment decision-making task. Four studies focused on the role that previous investments had on current decisions [ , , , ], while the rest concentrated on trading tasks. \n\nThe information presented was essentially market data. However, three studies also shared social information [ , , ], and one included the responses from a computer partner as a control condition [ ]. Only one study presented the stimuli under gain and loss domains [ ], whereas three studies used market bubble conditions [ , , ]. \n\nEight studies focused on certain cognitive processes while choosing between investments, including sunk costs [ , ], disposition effects [ ] and prediction errors [ , , ]. \n\nSome studies included other behavioral tests with the same participants whose brains were being scanned. For example, questionnaires were conducted on the future time perspective [ ], eye gaze [ ] and self-assessment questions [ ]. \n\nThe included studies involved 594 healthy adults without any real-life experience in investing, except for one study [ ]. Two studies included only males [ , ], and two did not report the sexes of the participants [ , ]. \n\nAll sixteen studies were conducted with fMRI and were published between 2005 and 2018. \n\n\n### 3.3. Study Results \n  \nRegarding studies with prior investments, it has been demonstrated that previous investments affect current decisions, making people more prone to continue investing. This is related to higher activation not only in the prefrontal and parietal cortices [ , , ], but also in the anterior insula, due to its role in risky decision-making [ , ]. This latter brain area, along with the ventral striatum, has been repeatedly found to be active in tasks involving trading decisions [ , , , , , , , ]. \n\nStudies which included social information reported a higher activation in the ventral striatum when investors decided to follow herd buying behavior [ ], as well as in the paracingulate cortex while forecasting price changes [ ]. On the contrary, overweighting private information involved activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior insula [ ] and the ACC to resolve social conflicts that arose from going against the group [ ]. However, this does not apply if the information is non-human [ , ]. In the study on gain and loss domains, only the former, along with the anterior insula, could be related to real-life experience in trading stocks [ ]. With respect to market bubble conditions, higher levels of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and vmPFC activity [ , ] and dlPFC and inferior parietal lobule connectivity [ ] indicate a propensity to ride bubbles and lose money. \n\nInvestment decisions can be affected by certain cognitive processes, such as higher sunk costs translating into more risk-taking behaviors in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices [ , ]; a higher disposition effect lowering ventral striatum activity because investors held onto losing assets longer [ ]; fictive errors driving investment behavior through increased activity in the ventral striatum [ , ]; and decreased activity in anterior insula and anterior insula-amygdala connectivity when reappraisal strategies regulated negative feelings [ ]. \n\nStudies with behavioral tests linked the estimation of future prices with activation in the inferior parietal lobule and future time perspective scores [ ]; the ability to infer other investors\u00b4 intentions with signal changes in the dmPFC and eye gaze scores; and beliefs and preferences toward risk (risk optimism index and risk tolerance index) with activation in the anterior insula and real-life trading experience [ ]. \n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-analysis of Brain Activation Results \n  \n and   display the results of the ALE meta-analysis we conducted. The four clusters we found were (1) ventral striatum + amygdala + anterior cingulate cortex; (2) the ventral striatum; (3) the anterior insula; and (4) the occipital cortex.   shows the characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis with the clusters reported by each study. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIt is not surprising that the first three clusters we found included areas of the brain that are closely related to the expectation of reward and risk, as investments are based on risk\u2013return tradeoffs. The fourth cluster, the occipital cortex, is activated during investment decisions as market information gathered via computers is perceived through the visual pathway. Nevertheless, while investors consider the need to control their emotions in order to not interfere with their investment decisions, these same brain regions are also involved in emotions when assessing the value of environmental stimuli. Although areas such as the vmPFC/OFC did not survive multiple comparisons,   shows that there was a tendency, which confirmed a role of these regions in investment decision-making, probably as a common scale of values. These results lead us to believe that investment choices are emotional decisions. \n\nGenerally, perceived risks (AIns) and risk attitudes (lateral OFC) seemed to affect the value of the chosen investment (dlPFC and amygdala) [ ]. Prior to deciding, value was correlated with mPFC, lPFC and posterior cingulate cortex activity [ ], whereas distinct neural circuits involving the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the AIns seemed to promote risk-seeking and risk-averse choices, respectively [ ] ( ). However, while excessive activation in these areas may cause investment mistakes [ ], reduced activation could lead to a learning process in which emotion regulation in fictive error signals (i.e., what might have happened) could guide valuation and choice [ ] ( ). These differences between actual returns and returns that could have been experienced if decisions had been diverse also drive investment behavior through significant ventral caudate and posterior parietal cortex activation [ ] ( ). \n\nSeeking environmental validity for these results, we found an attempt to connect real-life financial behavior with brain activation during an investment task. H\u00e4usler et al. [ ] demonstrated that choosing between a stock and a bond involved differences in brain activation in the AIns ( ). Active stock traders showed lower AIns activation when choosing the risky option (stock) compared with those who did not trade in real life [ ]. This may be due to individual differences in risk attitudes [ ] and the way in which investors perceive risks [ ]. Therefore, this difference was not based on cognitive abilities or financial constraints, but rather mediated by individuals\u00b4 preferences and beliefs about risky financial choices [ ]. \n\nIn financial markets, prices are determined by the interacting decisions of many investors. Inferring other agents\u00b4 intentions while making value judgments can lead to an increase in prices above their fundamental values, causing a market bubble. Under these conditions, social signals activate the paracingulate cortex [ ] and the dmPFC [ ], which affect value representations in the vmPFC [ ], an area known to be associated with asset preferences [ , ]. This increased sensitivity in the vmPFC toward other investors\u00b4 intentions makes activity in this brain area a predictor of the tendency to ride bubbles [ ] ( ). Although investors can be predisposed to buying stocks in market bubbles, the vmPFC has also been found to correlate with cash holdings [ ], probably due to its activation after monetary gains [ ]. Nonetheless, functional connectivity in the vmPFC decreased as bubbles gave way to an increase in dlPFC\u2013inferior parietal lobule (IPL) connectivity ( ), since supportive information is required from the IPL to estimate future stock prices so that the dlPFC can decide [ ]. \n\nAnother brain area that is thought to track bubble magnitude, responding to both buying and selling outcomes, is the NAcc [ ]. Increased NAcc activity is associated with lower returns [ ], given the propensity to buy risky assets [ ] in subsequent trading periods ( ). By contrast, if the activity occurs in the AIns, it will serve as a risk detection signal that will result in higher earnings, due to a higher propensity to sell before the bubble reaches its peak [ ] ( ). \n\nWhile there is no universally acknowledged explanation of how bubbles form, it is known that herd behavior often causes higher volatility in the stock markets [ ], both up and down, as investors decide to get in or out at the same time. The reason for this behavior is that when faced with uncertainty, investors tend to imitate the actions of others. Activity in the ventral striatum is influenced by social information on other investors\u2019 decisions, making one\u00b4s decision to buy or reject more in line with the stock bought or rejected by the herd [ ], even when there is no advantage in doing so [ ]. One feasible reason is that the striatum engages in prediction error signals, helping us learn the value of different options [ ]. Aligning with the group also activates the amygdala [ ], which may reflect a social learning process [ ], and the middle cingulate cortex due to its sensitivity in identifying oneself with other investors\u00b4 behaviors [ ]. However, if investors do not base their decisions on the behavior of others and act against the group, activity in the ACC increases to solve the social conflict that arises [ ] ( ). This would imply that investors update their beliefs by overweighting private information instead of social information, which results in higher activation of the inferior frontal gyrus\u2013AIns and lower activation of the parietal-temporal cortex, areas known to be associated with risk and uncertainty [ ]. \n\nIt is evident that information can alter financial decision-making, especially if prior investments have been made. Throwing good money after bad in order to avoid realizing certain losses is a cognitive bias that investors are sensitive to. This effect, known as sunk costs, demonstrates that the amount of money that has already been allocated affects the decision of whether to continue an investment or not. When sunk costs are higher, activity in the lPFC, the parietal cortex [ ], the amygdala and the ACC increases [ ], given the desire to not appear wasteful [ ]. At the same time, investors stop tracking the expected value of new investments to focus on previous investments to guide their current decisions so that the participation of the vmPFC and the NAcc in this decision process is considerably diminished, thereby making them prone to continue investing [ ]. It has been found that there is a strong negative connectivity between the dlPFC and the vmPFC after an investment is made as a way to not waste resources while overriding the commonly expected value-based decision-making [ ]. \n\nAccording to Kahneman and Tversky [ ], aversion to loss realization is one of the reasons why investors fall into sunk costs, a fallacy that may strengthen the disposition effect. The disposition effect is a behavior which leads investors to \u201csell winners too early and ride losers too long\u201d [ ], based on an irrational belief in mean reversion [ ]. There is a negative correlation between the disposition effect and ventral striatum activity related to rises in asset prices [ ] ( ). Expecting a return to the mean could be the reason behind an attenuated striatal response to upticks in value below the purchase price [ ], given that dopamine neurons respond more strongly to unpredicted rewards [ ]. \n\nThere are three main limitations to this review. The first limitation comes from a small sample size, considering that neuroeconomics is still a new field and most of the studies to date have focused on specific regions of interest instead of whole-brain analysis. The second limitation arises from the different stimuli and aims used in all investment decision-making tasks. For example, some studies have presented stimuli in a moving display or used live trading, which resemble more closely what happens in real-life financial decisions, as opposed to static stimuli trying to evoke actual dynamic markets. The third limitation derives from the lack of active stock traders as participants, except for the study by H\u00e4usler et al. [ ], given that environmental factors can shape individual financial decisions. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nInvestment decisions can overwhelm the brain. Trying to make sense of all information that financial markets convey while listening to one\u00b4s emotions without being overridden by them involves a coordinated effort of several brain areas in order to reach a decision. Since the question of how investors make decisions has not yet been fully uncovered, the aim of this meta-analysis is to determine the convergence of brain regions necessary for this complex decision-making process. Based on our ALE meta-analysis results, investment decisions involve limbic areas that ponder reward vs. risk, as investment portfolios are built on trying to achieve an optimal balance between return and risk. Emotions toward these two concepts, and the emotional conflicts that can arise while prioritizing among them, are an influential factor that guide this decision process. As Benjamin Graham has noted, \u201cindividuals who cannot master their emotions are ill-suited to profit from the investment process.\u201d Despite the four clusters found, we believe that investment decisions are not limited to those areas alone. In the stock market, aspects such as when to buy or sell, the market conditions or even the way in which other investors behave can affect whether an investment will result in being profitable or not. As Warren Buffet once advised, \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Every investor knows how to be fearful and greedy, but what they truly need to discover is when the right time to be one or the other is. The same investment behavior and the same brain activation could lead to different yields depending on the moment. Determining the role of a specific brain area in this decision-making process is indeed a complicated endeavor. Herein lies the difficulty in understanding how investors make decisions. Given the scarce literature, future studies should continue addressing this decision-making process while including whole-brain analysis in their methods. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 8003996, "text_md5": "89a29bb0f837fa10fc43ce4c8a9e793f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 60], "journal": [61, 70], "publication_year": [72, 76], "title": [87, 137], "keywords": [151, 261], "abstract": [274, 1166], "body": [1175, 25491]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33801075, "doi": "10.3390/brainsci11030399", "pmcid": "8003996", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003996", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8003996"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003996\">8003996</a>", "list_title": "PMC8003996  An ALE Meta-Analysis on Investment Decision-Making"}

In particular, their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry, for instance, as diagnostic tests/tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, given their complexity and potential clinical implications, there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence for the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe following databases were searched on November 28, 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), PsycINFO, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library. Studies that used a machine learning algorithm partially or fully for distinguishing individuals with ASD from control subjects and provided accuracy measures were included in our analysis. The bivariate random effects model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was used to investigate and resolve the source of heterogeneity between studies. True-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values from individual studies were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity values, draw Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and obtain the area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 43 studies were included for the final analysis, of which a meta-analysis was performed on 40 studies (53 samples with 12,128 participants). A structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) subgroup meta-analysis (12 samples with 1776 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC of 0.90/0.83. A functional magnetic resonance imaging/deep neural network subgroup meta-analysis (5 samples with 1345 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of ASD was considered acceptable by few accuracy measures only in cases of sMRI use; however, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning algorithms to clinical settings. \n\n\n## Trial Registration \n  \nPROSPERO CRD42018117779; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=117779 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Background \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), behaviorally characterized by a deficit in social communication and rigidity in interest or behavior by both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11), is believed to be a product of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors [ - ]. The latest prevalence of ASD has been reported to be 1 in 59 children aged 8 years, based on the 2014 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data [ ], and 1 in 40 children aged 3-17 years, based on parental reports of the diagnosis in a national survey [ ]. Despite the advancement of many biomarkers with potential in prediction or early detection of ASD (eg, structural magnetic resonance imaging [sMRI] or functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]), a diagnosis is not made until the age of 4-5 years, on average [ , ]. \n\nMachine learning has been increasingly studied as a novel tool to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and early detection of ASD [ ]. Unlike traditional rule-based algorithms that allowed computers to generate answers with preprogramed rules, machine learning allows building of an algorithm that can learn, predict, and improve with experience, based on big data [ , - ]. Psychiatric decision making is more sophisticated and difficult to characterize, compared with machine learning, although there are some common elements. Psychiatrists diagnose patients by observing their behaviors and registering all collected and collateral data into their (psychiatrists\u2019) cognitive system as sensory input values (eg, voice and vision). Similarly, machine learning requires a series of steps, including preprocessing (eg, noise removal from data before input into an algorithm), segmentation, and feature extraction [ ]. In particular, machine learning in the field of ASD diagnostics incorporates big data (eg, neuroimaging), making the input data immense and complex [ ]. The application of machine learning algorithms in the field of neuroimaging often requires an extra process, such as   feature selection   that extracts key features from a complex dataset. In other words, key features are selected before the learning process, which is called   feature selection   [ ]. \n\n\n### Objective \n  \nCurrently, machine learning is widely applied to the field of bioinformatics, including genetics and imaging, and many applications require signal recognition and processing [ ]. Machine learning algorithms are currently applied to the field of psychiatry in areas such as genomics, electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuroimaging. However, owing to the complex workflows implicated in machine learning itself, the accuracy of such algorithms is varied [ ]. This study aimed to suggest an integrated estimate of the accuracy for use of machine learning algorithms in distinguishing individuals with ASD from control groups through systematic review and meta-analysis of the available studies. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. The study protocol was written before initiation of the study and registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (trial registration: CRD42018117779). \n\n\n### Data Sources and Search Strategy \n  \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), and PsycINFO were selected as core search databases, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library was added to maximize the sensitivity of the search. The IEEE Xplore Digital Library is a database created by the IEEE, the largest of its kind worldwide, and includes more than 1800 peer-reviewed conference proceedings. Default search filters provided by journals were not used. There was no restriction by publication type (eg, conference proceedings) or language. The initial search was conducted on November 28, 2018. The search strategy and query per search database are listed in  . The primary consideration for study inclusion was if machine learning was partially or fully applied in distinguishing individuals clinically diagnosed with ASD from controls and assess the accuracy of such applications.   lists inclusion/exclusion criteria. An author (SM) retrieved the initial search results and removed duplicates by using the command   find duplicate   via a reference software (Endnote X9, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, another author (JK) manually searched for and removed any residual duplicates. Finally, the studies were screened independently by two authors (SM and JK) by title, abstract, and keywords, after which the full texts of the selected studies were screened by two authors (SM and JK) by inclusion/exclusion criteria. If any discrepancy was found in the final selection, the two authors reached a consensus via discussion. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nA data extraction form was created through discussion among the authors before the extraction process to suggest specific subgroups and coding processes (categorizing) for a meta-analysis ( ). The process is provided in detail in  . General characteristics such as author, publication year, sample size, average age, gender ratio, and data characteristics were extracted from individual studies. Information regarding the reference standard used in individual studies and definitions of positive/negative disease (autism positive/control) and methodologies to distinguish individuals with autism from control group were collected. Specific methodologies used to process and classify data for use in machine learning algorithms were also recorded (  and  ). All accuracy values were extracted, and true-positive / true-negative / false-positive / false-negative (TP/TN/FP/FN) values were calculated from individual studies for a meta-analysis. If the TP/TN/FP/FN values could not be calculated from the accuracy values provided in a study, an email was sent to the corresponding author to request raw data. If there was no response within 14 days, the study was not included in the meta-analysis. The extraction was performed independently by two authors (SM and JK). If there was any discrepancy in the extracted data, a consensus was reached by thorough discussion after repeating the same extraction process. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo authors (SM and JK) independently assessed the quality of individual studies based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). QUADAS-2 is a validated tool used to evaluate the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies by patient selection, index test, reference standard, and risk of bias (RoB) for internal validity and external validity for applicability concerns of individual studies [ ]. There was no disagreement between authors in the assessment of patient selection and reference standard domain. The index test, also known as the target tool of our investigation in this study, is a machine learning algorithm. The target tool, the machine learning algorithm\u2019s accuracy, is reported through a process called validation. However, when a study provided no information about the validation process, low RoB was assumed if independent datasets were used for training, building a model, and validation [ ]. Otherwise, the level of RoB was determined by thoroughly reviewing the validation processes. \n\n\n### Evidence Synthesis \n  \nIn our meta-analysis, a bivariate random effects model was used to consider both within- and between-subject variability and threshold effect [ ]. A Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics (SROC) curve was generated based on parameter estimates extracted from the bivariate random effects model [ ]. The SROC curve was specified by pooled sensitivity, specificity point, 95% CIs, and prediction region. Area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC) were calculated based on the SROC curve [ ]. Studies that were visually deviant from the 95% prediction region on the SROC curve were considered heterogeneous [ ]. Attempts were made to resolve the heterogeneity by performing a subgroup analysis\u2014generating individual SROC curves for subgroups (minimum 5 studies) [ ]. If most studies were within the 95% prediction region on the SROC curves of the subgroups, the sample was determined to be homogeneous, and integrated sensitivity, specificity, and SROC curve results were provided. If any of the TP/FP/TN/FN value was 0, 0.5 was added to prevent zero cell count problem [ ]. The TP/FP/TN/FN values were extracted or calculated from each independent sample in a study, and if multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to the same sample, an algorithm with the best accuracy (calculated as [TP+TN]/[TP+FP+TN+FN]) was selected for data extraction. \n\nA meta-analysis was conducted via the mada package in R (version 3.4.3, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), and statistical significance was expressed with 95% CIs. Publication bias was not assessed in our analysis, as there are currently no statistically adequate models in the field of meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search, Selection, and General Characteristics \n  \nAfter duplicate removal, of the 280 studies extracted from five databases and one additional database, 43 studies were selected, of which 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis.   provides details according to the screening stage. \n\nThe publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018 for the final selection of 43 studies, of which 40 were journal articles and 3 were gray literature elements (eg, conference proceedings). A total of 10 studies used a public database that was available on the internet and open to anyone, 18 used a private sector database (eg, clinic and hospital), 3 used both public and private databases, and the remaining 12 used databases from others. Regarding the average age of the sample, 5 studies included adults, 22 studies included school-aged participants, 11 included preschool-aged participants, and the remaining 5 did not provide any information. For the machine learning algorithm, 20 studies used a support vector machine (SVM), 3 used a deep neural network (DNN), 13 used others, and the remaining 10 used and compared multiple algorithms. For prediction, 11 studies used sMRI features, 9 used fMRI features, 9 used behavior traits, 5 used biochemical features, 4 used EEG features, and the remaining 2 used text or voice features. For reference standards, 24 studies used DSM-IV, DSM-IV - Text Revision, or DSM-5; 10 used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); 2 used ICD; and the remaining 7 did not provide relevant information. For the validation methodology, 37 studies only used internal validation, 2 only used external validation, and 4 used both. The abovementioned information is summarized in  , and the extracted raw data are presented in   and  . \n  \nFlowchart for the literature screening and selection process. \n    \nCharacteristics of 43 studies for the systematic review and 53 samples for the meta-analysis. \n    \n\n### Qualitative Assessment \n  \nOf the 43 studies in total, more than half were assessed to have an unclear RoB by patient selection domain (33 studies) and index test domain (29 studies). More than half were considered to have a low RoB by the total reference standard (35 studies) and flow and timing domains (35 studies). For applicability concern, about half (22 studies) were shown to have unclear or high-risk RoB by patient selection domain, whereas most were considered to have a low risk by index test (42 studies) and reference standard domain (36 studies). Qualitative assessment for all the individual studies is summarized in  , and the distribution is shown in  . \n  \nRisk of bias and applicability concern by domain in Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Microsoft Excel was used. \n  \n\n### Quantitative Analysis (Meta-Analysis) \n  \nOf the final selection of 43 studies, only 40, from which TP/FP/FN/TN values were extractable, were considered for the meta-analysis. A total of 53 independent samples were extracted from the 40 studies and included in the meta-analysis ( ). Of the 53 samples, 12,128 participants were inspected in the meta-analysis, with the total sensitivity and specificity ranging from 0.55 to 1.00 and 0.56 to 0.99, respectively. TP/FP/FN/TN, sensitivity, and specificity values for 53 individual samples are summarized in  , and visual distribution is provided as SROC in  . Of the 53 samples, 12 were found outside the 95% predictive region of the SROC curve, and therefore, there was heterogeneity between samples ( ). \n\nIn an attempt to resolve this heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis was conducted with 19 variables that had been predefined and coded. For replicability, a raw data sheet listing the precodified variables is available in  . As a result, among 19 variables,   predictor   was the only one by which the heterogeneity could be partially resolved. Of the 53 samples, for the sMRI subgroup that used sMRI as predictors, all the 12 samples were found to be within the predictive region of the SROC curve, thus resolving the heterogeneity ( ). \n\nFor the sMRI subgroup, the pooled sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC was 0.90/0.83. Meta-analysis was also attempted for the remaining subgroups, such as fMRI (15 samples), behavior traits (14 samples), and biochemical features (7 samples) subgroups, but the pooled sensitivity and specificity could not be provided owing to a significant degree of heterogeneity between samples: A few samples were shown to be far off the predictive region of the SROC curves ( - ). However, sub-subgroup meta-analysis using 5 samples that used fMRI as a predictor and DNN as a classifier allowed for the heterogeneity to be resolved and provided the pooled sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67 ( ). \n\nSimilarly, another sub-subgroup meta-analysis of six samples that used sMRI as a predictor and SVM as a classifier resolved the heterogeneity and resulted in a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.93), specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.71-0.95), and AUC/pAUC of 0.92/0.88 ( ). Sensitivity and specificity values and types of classifiers used for samples of individual subgroups that used neuroimaging features (sMRI and fMRI subgroups) as predictors are provided in  , and a forest plot is provided in  . \n\nSummary Receiver Operating Characteristics curve for functional magnetic resonance imaging/deep neural network sub-subgroup (5 samples). Note that confidence region is the 95% confidence region around the summary sensitivity and specificity points, and the prediction region is the 95% prediction of the true sensitivity and specificity interval for future observations. SROC: Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics. \n\nThe sensitivity and specificity for the behavior traits (14 samples) subgroup ranged from 0.68 to 1.00 and 0.56 to 0.9, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the biochemical features (7 samples) subgroup ranged from 0.77 to 0.94 and 0.72 to 0.93, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the EEG subgroup (3 samples) ranged from 0.94 to 0.97 and 0.81 to 0.94, respectively. The results are summarized in  . Information for other measures not included in the meta-analysis is provided in  . \n  \nSummary Receiver Operating Characteristics curve for all 53 samples.

On the basis of the opinion that the AUC/pAUC value is considered acceptable when above 0.7, both the AUC/pAUC values can be thought to be acceptable for the sMRI subgroup [ ]. However, given the wide confidence interval for each summary sensitivity and specificity, the clinical usefulness of those values can be difficult to determine. In addition, precaution is warranted for interpreting the accuracy results, as the 95% predictive region is larger than the 95% CI region on the SROC curve, indicating a high degree of uncertainty for the pooled sensitivity and specificity calculated [ ]. In addition, only one sample from the sMRI subgroup utilized an external validation method, where demographic characteristics of the training dataset were independent of those of the validation dataset. In other words, the rest of the samples in the sMRI subgroup built their validation datasets from participants who were similar to or the same as those recruited in the training datasets. Hence, those samples are believed to have high risks of overfitting, compromising the generalizability of machine learning models and overestimating the results of the meta-analysis of the sMRI subgroup [ ]. \n\nMachine learning algorithms can be divided into supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning by learning pattern [ ]. SVM, for which subgroup analysis was performed for sMRI, is the oldest method of supervised learning, whereas DNN, for which subgroup analysis was conducted for fMRI, is the most advanced of the neural network methods (supervised learning), modeled after the mechanism of neurons [ ]. On the contrary, the accuracy values for the fMRI subgroup using one of the latest machine learning algorithms, DNN, were found to be lower than those for the sMRI subgroup. This may, in part, be attributable to possible overestimation secondary to the overfitting in the sMRI subgroup. In addition, one of the studies in the fMRI/DNN sub-subgroup composed their dataset by recruiting over 1000 participants from various sites to minimize limitations such as overfitting in their analysis. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. Of the final selection of 43 studies, 33 did not provide clear information regarding the process of obtaining an original database or a recruiting training/validation dataset from the real clinical world, or raw data such as basic demographic characteristics of the participants before the input process, thus increasing the RoB in the patient selection processes. For example, more than half the finally selected studies did not match the samples for age or gender, and the number of images or signals per participant was not specified in most of the neuroimaging and EEG studies. Subgroups other than the sMRI subgroup included studies that used the same database, thus raising concerns for possible sample overlap, which was challenging to process statistically owing to the lack or absence of information on the patient selection process. If datasets overlapped and lowered the accuracy, the subgroup meta-analysis would have been underestimated and vice versa. In addition, behavior, EEG, and voice/text subgroups did not consist of enough studies to attempt to resolve the heterogeneity and provide pooled accuracy values. Furthermore, owing to the heterogeneity, summary accuracy values could not be obtained for adult (aged over 18 years), school-age (between 6 and 18 years), and preschool-age (less than 6 years) subgroups, thus limiting the ability to draw a conclusion on accuracy by age groups. Corresponding authors for individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were reached out to, and one responded. Even if more had responded, to our knowledge, there would not have been any way to perform the aggregation. \n\n\n### Comparison With Prior Work \n  \nTo our knowledge, there is currently no study that has performed a systematic review and/or a meta-analysis on diagnostic test accuracy for the use of machine learning in diagnosing ASD and suggested its pooled estimate accuracies. In this analysis, many individual studies reported small TP and high TP (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) and caused significant heterogeneity for a meta-analysis (see  ). Authors resolved the heterogeneity by using subgroup analyses. As a result, individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were barely included in fMRI and sMRI subgroup analyses, thereby resolving the heterogeneity and allowing conduct of the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, recommendations from our results may improve the quality of prospective studies using machine learning algorithms in ASD diagnosis. First, Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) can guide machine learning diagnostic studies to enhance the reporting of patient selection processes. In addition, there is the comprehensive guideline for algorithm developers in terms of choosing an adequate predictive model for a target sample; setting the parameters, definition, or threshold; and minimizing errors such as overfitting and perfect separation [ ]. Use of the STARD and other guidelines [ ] would facilitate more transparent and comprehensive work in this space. Although not discussed in the studies included in our analysis, decision or running time for a machine learning algorithm in ASD diagnosis could become an important quality measure in the near future when these algorithms might be employed in a busy daily clinical practice. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of diagnosing ASD by machine learning algorithms was found to be acceptable by select accuracy measures only in studies that utilized sMRI. However, because of the high heterogeneity in the analyzed studies, it is impossible to draw a conclusion on any subgroups that used behavior traits or biochemical markers as predictors. There is a clear need for new studies with more comprehensive reporting of the selection process and dataset to draw a more accurate conclusion. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6942187, "text_md5": "fda99d2765b2abdb90ee68cf5070b1ac", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 84], "journal": [85, 101], "publication_year": [103, 107], "title": [118, 284], "keywords": [298, 400], "abstract": [413, 3040], "body": [3049, 25999]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31562756, "doi": "10.2196/14108", "pmcid": "6942187", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942187", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6942187"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942187\">6942187</a>", "list_title": "PMC6942187  Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies"}

In humans, neuroimaging studies of person memory report consistent activations in the ATL to famous and personally familiar faces and studies of patients report resection or damage of the ATL causes an associative prosopagnosia in which face perception is intact but face memory is compromised. In addition, high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates and electrophysiological studies of humans also suggest regions of the ventral ATL are sensitive to novel faces. The current study extends previous findings by investigating whether similar subregions in the dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL are sensitive to personally familiar, famous, and novel faces. We present the results of two studies of person memory: a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies and an empirical fMRI study using optimized imaging parameters. Both studies showed left-lateralized ATL activations to familiar individuals while novel faces activated the right ATL. Activations to famous faces were quite ventral, similar to what has been reported in previous high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates. These findings suggest that face memory-sensitive patches in the human ATL are in the ventral/polar ATL. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlthough personally known and famous faces are often used interchangeably as \u201cfamiliar\u201d faces, there are distinct differences between them, which have implications on a theoretical and neural level. Personally familiar faces are associated with richer and more extensive first-person semantic and episodic knowledge than famous faces, as well as greater and more nuanced emotional significance (Sugiura et al.,  ), whereas famous faces are defined by their unique semantic attributes such as having starred in a popular movie or having served as president of the United States (Ross and Olson,  ). fMRI studies of person memory have most commonly contrasted famous faces to unfamiliar faces and one of the most consistently reported activations is in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL); see Leveroni et al.,  ; Henson et al.,  ; Gobbini et al.,  ; Eger et al.,  ; Elfgren et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ; Brambati et al.,  ; Nielson et al.,  ; Ramon et al.,  ; Barense et al.,  ; Cloutier et al.,  ; Gesierich et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ; Sugiura et al.,  . These fMRI findings extend earlier PET studies reporting ATL activations to famous faces (Sergent et al.,  , ; Gorno-Tempini et al.,  ,  ; Dubois et al.,  ; Gorno-Tempini and Price,  ; Grabowski et al.,  ; Sugiura et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Damasio et al.,  ). \n\nRich and converging evidence for the role of the ATL in processing familiar faces also comes from the neuropsychology literature. Humans with ATL damage consistently exhibit problems with person memory, a disorder that Damasio and colleagues termed \u201camnesic associative prosopagnosia\u201d (Damasio et al.,  ). Patients with focal unilateral lesions of the ATL due to stroke, insult, or resection surgery have difficulties remembering information about people, especially their names [reviewed by Olson et al. ( ); Simmons and Martin ( ); Wong and Gallate ( )]. Damasio et al. ( ) carried out extensive research on the face processing capabilities of these individuals and reported that while face perception was intact, face memory was impaired. Left-lateralized lesions of the ATL tended to affect lexical aspects of person memory, such as recollection of names, while right-lateralized lesions tended to affect feelings of familiarity and processing and retrieval of biographical information. \n\nSimilarly, one of the first symptoms of semantic dementia, which is correlated with early deterioration of the ATLs, is difficulty remembering information about people such as their name and biographical information (Evans et al.,  ; Snowden et al.,  ). For instance, Thompson et al. ( ) reported that 31 of the 47 frontotemporal dementia patients in their study had specific complaints of difficulty recalling people's names. \n\nThe face sensitivity of the ATL is both mnemonic and perceptual. Electrophysiological and fMRI studies in humans and monkeys indicate that the ventral ATL is sensitive to novel faces (Nestor et al.,  ) and that activity in this region is enhanced by affective experience and conceptual familiarity with the depicted faces (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). As noted earlier, patients with ATL lesions have intact face perception, but impaired face memory (Damasio et al.,  ). Allison and colleagues recorded from the ventral surface of the human temporal lobe in patients undergoing resection surgery and found that a late event-related potential (ERP) termed the P350 localized to the ventral ATL was preferentially sensitive to faces and especially to face priming (Allison et al.,  ; Barbeau et al.,  ). Neurons in monkey ventral ATL have response profiles indicative of mnemonic activity: spike rate decreases rapidly with stimulus repetition, firing patterns are maintaining over brief delay intervals, and neurons appear to be sensitive to associations between faces and other stimuli (Nakamura et al.,  ; Nakamura and Kubota,  ). \n\nIn sum, these findings provide consistent evidence that subregions of the ATL play an important role in person identification and memory. The goal of the current study was to examine this general finding in greater detail so that we can more precisely describe the functional anatomy and response properties of the ATL. We were interested in two specific questions: (1) Are the same ATL subregions sensitive to personally familiar and famous faces? (2) Are the face-sensitive subregions of the ATL localized to dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL? \n\nWith respect to the first question, a small number of studies have reported greater BOLD activity to personally familiar as compared to famous faces in the ATL, as well as in the (MPFC), limbic regions, temporal parietal junction, and the posterior cingulate. These differences have been variously attributed to person-selective representations (Gobbini et al.,  ; Sugiura et al.,  ,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ) or to the socioemotional aspects of recognizing familiar people (Gobbini et al.,  ; Gobbini and Haxby,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ). In one recent study, repetition suppression to familiar faces was observed in a superior-medial region of the ATL (Sugiura et al.,  ). However, no activations to famous faces were found in the ATL. This finding is an outlier in the greater ATL literature since a large number of prior findings have reported that famous faces activate the ATL and that ATL damage impairs the ability to recognize or name famous faces. As such, more research is needed, using imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage. \n\nIn regards to the second question it is informative to review findings from macaques in order to better understand the particular ATL subregions sensitive to faces. Several high-resolution fMRI studies in macaques have reported the existence of face-sensitive patches in the ventral ATL (Hadj-Bouziane et al.,  ; Moeller et al.,  ; Tsao et al.,  ; Bell et al.,  ; Rajimehr et al.,  ; Ku et al.,  ; Pinsk et al.,  ). Earlier single-unit studies reported face sensitive neurons in the anterior STS and the temporal pole (Hasselmo et al.,  ; Eifuku et al.,  ; De Souza et al.,  ; Leopold et al.,  ). \n\nThe monkey ATL face patches are found on the inferior bank of the anterior STS going into the anterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the inferior surface of the ATL (Ku et al.,  ). No activations have been reported in the polar tip or superior aspects of the ATL. Two studies using unfamiliar face stimuli directly compared monkeys to humans and found homologous activated face patches in the anterior MTG and ventral surface of the ATL (Rajimehr et al.,  ; Pinsk et al.,  ). The majority of studies reporting ATL activations in humans have used famous or personally familiar face stimuli, although in two notable cases unfamiliar faces were shown to activate the ATL. Kriegeskorte et al. ( ) and Nestor et al. ( ) used multivariate techniques to ask which parts of the brain discriminate individual faces. The peak described by Kriegeskorte was in the right ventral ATL and the peak described by Nestor was in the right ventromedial ATL/uncus. \n\nIn contrast, the reported ATL activations to famous and personally familiar faces in human studies are typically in the polar tip and the superior ATL. It is unclear whether this localization is real or an artifact of methodological difficulties of imaging the ATLs. fMRI signals in the ATLs are compromised by susceptibility artifacts and signal distortion due to the proximity of these regions to the nasal sinuses and ear canals (Devlin et al.,  ). Moreover, many studies use a restricted field-of-view (FOV) that excludes the inferior parts of the brain, including the inferior ATL, from image acquisition (Visser et al.,  ). \n\nIn order to answer our two questions of interest, we used two methods. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies of person memory using the activation likelihood method (ALE) (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Second, we conducted an fMRI study of person knowledge using imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage in which activations to personally familiar individuals and famous faces were qualitatively compared to each other. We predicted that personally familiar as compared to famous and unfamiliar faces would be associated with greater activations in the superior-polar ATL due to the greater emotional processing performed on these stimuli. Evidence suggests the superior-polar aspects of the ATL are more closely connected with neuromodulatory regions such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, and are more greatly involved in abstract forms of social and emotional processing (see Olson et al.,   for a review). In addition we predicted that when optimized imaging parameters were used, we would find evidence of face-sensitive ATL activations that extend into the ventral ATL. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \nA total of 25 articles were included in the ALE analysis. Seven of these studies were used in the personally familiar condition with a total of 136 subjects (70 male, 66 female; mean age = 28.9 years). The famous face condition was comprised of 18 studies and had 247 subjects (125 male, 122 female; mean age = 28.74 years). A total of 202 foci were used in the personally familiar face condition and 340 foci were used in the famous face condition. \n\n#### Procedure \n  \nOur methods follow those detailed by Binder et al. ( ) and are summarized below. All coordinates were reported in or converted to Talairach space. Random effects analysis [consistent with Eickhoff et al. ( )] were conducted and probabilistic maps of the resulting sets of coordinates were constructed using the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method (Turkeltaub et al.,  ), implemented in the GingerALE 2.1 software package (Laird et al.,  ) (available at www.brainmap.org), using an 8-mm FWHM 3D Gaussian point spread function and a spatial grid composed of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm voxels. This method treats each reported focus as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution. The 3D Gaussian distributions corresponding to all foci included in a given random effects analysis are summed to create a whole-brain map that represents the overlap of activation peaks at each voxel. The ALE statistical map is converted into a voxelwise probability map. ALE maps from each dataset were thresholded at an ALE value that yielded a corrected mapwise value and a false discovery rate (FDR) of   p   < 0.05. The maps depicted in the figures are the corrected ALE maps generated by GingerALE 2.1 software. \n\n\n#### Study inclusion criteria and description \n  \nStudies were identified through searches of online databases for the years 1980 through 2012 (see Table  ). Any additional relevant articles known to the authors, cited in the initial set of articles, or encountered during the review process were added to the list. Inclusion criteria were: (1) the use of fMRI; (2) testing of healthy young human participants; (3) use of a standard control or baseline task; (4) whole or nearly whole brain analysis; (5) availability of peak activation coordinates from a group activation map; and (6) use of several different famous or personally familiar faces as stimuli (studies that used a single face stimulus, such as a romantic partner, were excluded). Studies were also excluded if they used non-standard cohort sizes (  N   < 10) or imaging parameters (e.g., TE of 66) that diminished the possibility of observing activations in the ATLs. Our analysis used two person memory comparisons:\n   \nPersonally known faces (personal acquaintances, close friends, and familiar faces): Total papers = 7. Coordinates were included from the following contrasts: friends/family > baseline; friends/family > unfamiliar. \n  \nFamous faces: Total Papers = 18. Coordinates were included from the following contrasts: famous > baseline; famous > unfamiliar. \n  \n  \n fMRI studies of person knowledge included in the random effects ALE analysis  . \n  \nData from the \u201ctrained knowledge\u201d column includes studies in which study participants were trained to associate different types of semantic knowledge (e.g., a profession) with a novel face. These data were not included in an ALE analysis because the number of studies was small and the training paradigms variable. The last two columns list whether ATL activations were reported and the experimental task/comparisons in each study. We note that Turk and colleagues ( ) reported that technical limitations kept them from seeing activations in the ATL. \n  \nWe created conjunction maps by overlaying these analyses. \n\n\n\n### Empirical study \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nSeventeen female adults were recruited from the greater Philadelphia area via local advertisements. Data from two participants were excluded due to excessive movement. The final sample consisted of 15 female participants (mean age = 22.33, SD = 3.51). We chose to restrict our sample to females because numerous behavioral and neural studies of face recognition have reported significant gender differences (Ellis et al.,  ; Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd,  ; Lewin and Herlitz,  ; Rehnan and Herlitz,  ,  ; McBain et al.,  ; Ino et al.,  ; Megreya et al.,  ). All participants received monetary compensation for their participation. They were native English speakers, right-handed, had normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of psychological, developmental, or neurological disorders. Informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the Temple University. \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nThere were four types of stimuli. The   famous face stimuli   (=Faces ) consisted of 32 people that had a high likelihood of being known by the average American undergraduate or graduate student (e.g., Brad Pitt). The   friend face stimuli   (=Faces ) were individually tailored for each participant. Each participant brought two different photos of the faces of 5 best friends, 5 close friends, and 5 acquaintances to a pre-testing session. Photos consisted of snapshots that varied in lighting, poses, facial expressions, quality, etc. The   unfamiliar face stimuli   (=Faces ) were a wide selection of unknown faces whose ethnicities and ages matched that of the famous faces and the friends. Like the other face stimuli, they consisted of a mixture of professional photographs and snapshots that varied in lighting, pose, etc. Last, the   baseline control stimuli   consisted of blurred images. Additional comparison and baseline conditions consisted of famous landmarks (=Landm ), non-famous landmarks (=Landm ), and a blurred landmark baseline. Similar stimuli were used as a fame localizer in a previous study by our laboratory (Ross and Olson,  ). \n\n\n#### fMRI task and design \n  \nAll participants were provided with standardized computer-based instructions and a practice session prior to the scan. During the scan, a ~10 min long high-resolution anatomical scan was collected prior to the experiment. Portions on the fMRI task are irrelevant to the question asked in this study and will be described in a different publication. \n\n  Famous face task.    Our laboratory used a face memory localizer task that had been used successfully in a previous study to localize activation for famous faces (Ross and Olson,  ). During the localizer run, a 0-back task was used in which participants were told to press a button with their left index finger when two stimuli of the same type were detected in succession: both famous, both non-famous, or both baseline images in succession. Participants were also told to press with the right index finger when it was a mixed condition (e.g., one famous and one non-famous face). During one block two stimuli were presented in succession, for the duration of 4.5 s each. Each blocked presentation was preceded by a 3 s prompt with a brief reminder of the instruction and followed by a 3 s response prompt. Blocks consisted of pairs of pictures that were both famous (20), both non-famous (20), mixed (10), face baseline (5), landmark baseline (5) totaling 60 blocks, and a duration of 15 min. \n\n  Friend face task.    There were five experimental runs during which participants performed a social and geographical closeness task using photos of friends and unknown individuals. The experimental task had a 2 (type of closeness: social, geographical) \u00d7 2 (stimulus: faces, names) \u00d7 3 (distance: close, medium, far) design. Baseline conditions were also included in each run and consisted of the faces and names of unknown people. Only brain activations in response to the faces of friends and unknown people in the social closeness and baseline conditions are relevant to the question of interest in this study and are described in greater detail. Photographs of the faces of \u201cbest friends,\u201d \u201cclose friends,\u201d \u201cacquaintances,\u201d and \u201cunknown people\u201d were presented in separate blocks during a single run. \n\nOn each trial one photo was presented left of center and the second photo was presented right of center. One photo in each pair was always presented at a discriminable location above the center x axis of the screen and the other photo was presented at a counter location below the x axis. During the social closeness condition, participants indicated by button press whether the friend shown on the left or on the right of the screen was socially closest to them. During baseline blocks, participants were asked to decide which photograph of an unknown person was presented in a higher position on the screen by pressing the left or right button with their index finger. Each run was comprised of 14 blocks that were 18 s long. A 3 s instruction screen was followed by 5 trials consisting of a 2.5 s presentation of two friends photographs and a 0.5 s inter-trial interval. A 9 s rest period during which a fixation cross was presented followed each block. Each condition was presented one time in a single run. \n\n\n#### Imaging procedure \n  \nNeuroimaging sessions were conducted at the Temple University Hospital on a 3.0 T Siemens Verio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel Siemens head coil. \n\nFunctional T2 -weighted images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent contrasts were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence [repetition time (TR), 3 s; echo time (TE), 20 ms;   FOV   = 240 \u00d7 240; voxel size, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2.5 mm; matrix size, 80 \u00d7 80; flip angle = 90\u00b0] and automatic shimming. This pulse sequence was optimized for ATL coverage and sensitivity based on pilot scans performed for this purpose, details of which are reported in Ross and Olson ( ). Visual inspection of the coregistered functional image confirmed excellent signal coverage in the ATLs in all participants. Some signal loss in the orbitofrontal cortex was observed and varied between participants (see Figure  ). \n  \n Probability maps (PM) reporting the percentage or participants (ranging from 10 to 100%) that showed a TSNR greater than 40 for each voxel.   Panel   (A)   provides a view of the coverage for all participants in the orbitofrontal cortex. Panel   (B)   provides a view of the coverage in the left anterior temporal lobe. \n  \nThirty-eight interleaved axial slices with 2.5 mm thickness were acquired to cover the temporal lobes. On the basis of the anatomical information of the structural scan the lowest slice was individually fitted to cover the most inferior aspect of the inferior temporal lobes. \n\nThe functional runs were preceded by a high-resolution anatomical scan that was ~10 min long. The anatomical image was used to fit the volume of covered brain tissue acquired in the functional scan. The T1-weighted images were acquired using a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo pulse sequence (TR, 1900 ms; TE, 2.94 ms; FOV = 188 \u00d7 250 mm; inversion time, 900 ms; voxel size, 1 \u00d7 0.9766 \u00d7 0.9766 mm; matrix size, 188 \u00d7 256; flip angle = 9\u00b0, 144 contiguous slices of 0.9766 mm thickness). Visual stimuli were shown through goggles with a resolution of 800 \u00d7 600 pixels, purchased from Resonance Technologies, CA, USA. Responses were recorded using a four-button fiber optic response pad system. The stimulus delivery was controlled by E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburg, PA) on a windows laptop located in the scanner control room. \n\n\n#### Image analysis \n  \nfMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Brain Voyager software (Goebel et al.,  ). The preprocessing of the functional data included a correction for head motion (trilinear/sinc interpolation), the removal of linear trends and frequency temporal filtering using a fast fourier transform (FFT) and a cut-off of three cycles or sine waves. The data were coregistered with their respective anatomical data and transformed into Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). The resulting volumetric time course data were smoothed using an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. \n\nFor all blocks, a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) was modeled spanning the 15 s for each block. A z-transform was applied to normalize the time course. Predictors were built by convolving the boxcar waveform for each condition with a double-gamma HRF (onset = 0, response undershoot ratio = 6, time to response peak = 5 s, time to undershoot peak = 15 s, response dispersion = 1, undershoot dispersion = 1). Only the manipulated conditions in the 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 design were included in the model. Motion parameters were not included as covariates in the regression, because motion was corrected for in preprocessing. Including them as covariates in the regression has been shown to have a deleterious effect on the mean contrast estimates in block design studies (Johnstone et al.,  ). The 3 s instruction screen at the start of each block and the 9 s rest period following each block were modeled out and were also not included in the HRF. \n\n\n#### Temporal signal to noise ratio (TSNR) \n  \nThe ATL and inferior portions of the frontal lobe are prone to susceptibility artifacts so we examined [Temporal Signal to Noise Ratio (TSNR)] maps to ensure that the quality of the signal in these regions was adequate to detect BOLD signal. To check the consistency of coverage in the signal quality in the ATLs, we generated probability maps indicating for each voxel the percentage of participants that showed TSNR above the threshold of 40, which is considered sufficient for detecting differences between conditions (Murphy et al.,  ). Using a highly conservative estimate of signal coverage in the bilateral ATL, 7 participants showed full coverage and 8 participants showed some signal loss either on the inferior surface (a small portion of the inferior ATL), medial surface near piriform cortex, or a region just posterior to the ATLs caused by the ear canals. Six participants showed full coverage of the orbitofrontal cortex and 9 participants showed minor loss in coverage of the most inferior slice in the posterior orbitofrontal cortex. Overall, the signal quality in the ATL was excellent. Figure   shows a probability map that the TSNR was above 40 for each voxel for all participants. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nWe performed a whole-brain analysis using a random effects general linear model for conditions in each of the experimental tasks. We used a voxelwise FDR approach to try and replicate previous findings in humans for famous/non-famous faces and landmarks. We also used this approach to assess activations in the ATL for novel faces/novel landmarks that were comparable to those activations reported in monkey studies. Second, we conducted somewhat more liberal whole-brain analyses using a cluster thresholding procedure that calculates the likelihood of obtaining different cluster sizes over 1000 trials. This procedure began by setting the voxelwise threshold to   p   < 0.05 and was followed by the Monte Carlo simulation of this data to produce a cluster threshold that also ensures a global error rate of   p   < 0.05. Each cluster size threshold was calculated within a whole-brain gray matter map. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE results \n  \nThe results of the ALE random effects analyses are reported in Table   and depicted in Figure  , top panel. All ALE results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method at a threshold of   p   < 0.05 and a minimum cluster size of 100 mm . Both conditions showed a left-lateralized bias although some significant activations were also found in the right hemisphere. Of interest to the topic of this paper, there were three left-lateralized ATL loci's: (1) a ventromedial activation, corresponding to entorhinal cortex to famous faces; (2) an anterior STS activation to personally familiar faces; and (3) a temporal pole [anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG)] activation to both famous and personally familiar faces. The entorhinal activation was part of a larger activation extending along the entire length of the hippocampus, spilling over into the amygdala. In contrast, the anterior STS activation was very focal. Last, the striking temporal polar activation continued into orbitofrontal cortex in more dorsal slices. Famous faces showed a relatively more ventral pattern of activation with the most ventral activation in the medial ATL/entorhinal cortex at \u221226, \u22126, \u221229. \n  \n Talairach coordinates of peak activations from the random effects ALE meta-analysis  . \n    \n Activations to famous and familiar faces from a random effects ALE meta-analysis (Panel A) and activations from random effects group analyses in the empirical study (Panel B).   The white circles highlight activations to famous and familiar faces in the left anterior temporal lobe. \n  \n\n### Empirical study results \n  \n#### Behavioral findings \n  \nDuring the famous face task, participants correctly identified 94% of the famous faces, 70% of the non-famous faces, 86% of the famous landmarks, and 67% of non-famous landmarks. Mixed face trials (distractors) were identified with 78% accuracy and mixed place trials in 71% of cases. The baseline task was correctly performed in 92% of all cases. \n\nThe social closeness judgments participants made of their best friends during the five main experimental runs were 91% consistent with their previously reported rank orderings. Response consistency was judged by comparing the behavioral data during the scanner task to the rank orderings of best friends on social closeness that participants made during the preliminary testing session. Participants were 98% accurate performing the baseline task with photos of unknown people. \n\n\n#### Functional MRI results \n  \nFirst we performed a \u201csanity check\u201d that was aimed at replicating prior findings about non-famous faces/landmarks. We asked whether faces and landmarks   per se   activated well-known networks of brain regions including the fusiform face area. We performed a whole brain analysis of the conditions in the famous face task using a random effects general linear model. We then conducted a contrast between all faces and landmarks [(Faces  + Faces  + Faces ) vs. (Landm  + Landm  + Landm )] at an FDR corrected threshold [q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.006] for the whole brain. The   t  -map revealed that faces relative to landmarks-activated regions previously shown to be engaged in face processing: right FFA, bilateral temporoparietal junction going into the posterior STS, precuneus, bilateral ATL in the anteriormost section of the MTG, bilateral entorhinal cortex, and a small region of MPFC. Likewise, landmarks engaged a typical pattern of activity in bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, and regions of the dorsal visual stream. At this threshold, landmarks did not activate the ATL. \n\nSecond, we asked whether novel faces, as used in many monkey fMRI studies, activate the ATL. We compared novel faces to novel landmarks [Faces  vs. Landmarks ; q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.005] and found a small region of activation in the right FFA and the right ventromedial ATL in a region corresponding to perirhinal cortex (see Figure  , top panel). This ATL activation is posterior to the ATL activations to famous and familiar faces, reported later. Landmarks engaged a typical pattern of activity in bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, regions of the dorsal visual stream, and did not activate the ATL. \n  \n Activations to a comparison of novel faces and novel landmarks from the empirical study are also shown (Panel A).   The white circle highlights activation to novel faces in the right ATL. Activations to a comparison of famous faces and novel landmarks from the empirical study are also shown (Panel   B  ). The white circle highlights activation to famous faces in the left and right ATL. \n  \nThird, using the same baseline task as the prior analysis, we asked whether famous and personally familiar faces activated the ATL. We compared famous faces to novel landmarks [Faces  vs. Landmarks ; q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.005] and found regions typically engaged in face processing including the right FFA, precuneus, MTG, and bilateral ventromedial ATL activations. Although the centroid of the ATL activity was similar to that found for novel faces, the activations were bilateral and more extensive (see Figure  ). Again, landmarks demonstrated a typical pattern of activity activating the bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, regions of the dorsal visual stream, and did not activate the ATL. \n\nFourth, to specifically examine face familiarity, we asked whether famous faces preferentially activated the ATL using the contrast (Faces  vs. Faces ). We present these results corrected for multiple comparisons at   p   < 0.05 with a cluster threshold applied (cluster threshold = 45). This contrast revealed two face patches in the left ATL: (1) a patch in the polar aspect of the MTG; (2) a smaller medial activation in entorhinal cortex. One right-lateralized ATL activation, in the ventral ATL corresponding to parahippocampal gyrus/entorhinal cortex, was found when we used a more liberal threshold of   p   < 0.05 (uncorrected). Other activations specific to famous faces were in the posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, left FFA, and right supermarginal gyrus. Non-famous faces compared to famous faces preferentially activated clusters in the parietal and frontal lobes (see Table  ). \n  \n Talairach coordinates of peak activations from the empirical study  . \n  \nTo see whether the ATL activations were specific to famous face stimuli as compared to other unique stimuli such as famous landmarks, we performed the same contrast corrected for multiple comparisons but on landmark stimuli (Landmarks  vs. Landmarks ;   p   < 0.05 cluster threshold = 39). Bilateral ATL activations were observed in a ventral medial portion of the ATL, more posterior and ventral in the uncus/perirhinal cortex (\u221222, \u22121, \u221239) to that observed in the famous face contrast. A similar locus of activity was reported previously (Ross and Olson,  ). Activations to famous landmarks did not overlap with the activations to famous faces in the ATLs. \n\nLast, we asked whether personally familiar individuals (e.g., best friends) activated the ATL in a similar manner as famous faces. We performed a whole brain analysis of conditions in the friend face task using a random effects general linear model. We then conducted a contrast corrected for multiple comparisons: Faces  vs. Faces ;   p   < 0.05; cluster threshold = 51. This contrast showed two left-lateralized ATL patches: (1) a patch in the anterior STS; and (2) a patch in the anterior MTG/pole. Additional left lateralized activations were observed in orbitofrontal cortex, medial PFC, ACC, hippocampus, precuneus, extrastriate visual cortex, as well as bilateral activations in the FFA, TPJ, and other regions (see Table  ). No regions were relatively more sensitive to novel faces. \n\nThe conjunction map revealed minor overlap for famous and familiar in the left ATL polar tip (see Figure  , bottom panel). \n\nVisual comparison between the activations found in the meta-analysis and our empirical study revealed strikingly similar activations (see Figure  ). Both the ALE and empirical analyses showed left-lateralized activations to famous and personally familiar faces in the ATL. Within the left ATL, both analyses showed that famous faces active a ventromedial region corresponding to entorhinal cortex. Also both analyses showed that famous and personally familiar faces activate an overlapping region of the temporal pole (BA 38). In the ALE analysis, this extended into orbitofrontal cortex for both comparisons while in the empirical analysis it was only observed for the personally familiar contrast. One difference revealed by this comparison is that activations to famous faces were relatively more ventral in the empirical analysis (z plane = \u221234) as compared to the ALE analysis (z plane = \u221229). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goal of the present study was to investigate two questions in order to learn more about the sensitivity of the ATL to faces: (1) Are the same ATL subregions sensitive to personally familiar, famous, and novel faces? (2) Are the face-sensitive subregions of the ATL localized to dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL? To answer these questions we qualitatively compared the results of our ALE meta-analysis of face familiarity to the findings from our empirical fMRI study using famous, personally familiar, and unfamiliar faces. We were particularly interested in whether ATL activations to different categories of faces were present in the ventral ATL, similar to what has been reported in monkeys using novel and familiar faces. In order to maximize our ability to find activations in the ATL in our empirical study, we used imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage. Overall, the findings of the empirical study and meta-analysis were notably consistent revealing left-lateralized ATL sensitivity to two kinds of familiar faces and right-lateralized sensitivity to novel faces. In addition, the activations to familiar faces associated with knowledge were found in distinct subregions of the left ATL with the only overlap occurring in the polar tip. \n\n### Activation of the anterior temporal lobes by novel, famous, and personally familiar faces \n  \nWe began by conducting a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies of person memory where the typical subtraction is famous or personally familiar faces minus unfamiliar faces. Although the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria we used in our ALE analyses resulted in a number of studies included in the final analysis that might be considered small [see Turkeltaub and Coslett ( ) for a discussion of group size], we used a conservative random effects ALE meta-analysis that allowed generalization of the results to the entire population of analyzed studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The results showed significant left-lateralized ATL activations for personally familiar and famous faces. Personally familiar faces activated distinct regions of the left superior ATL and the left orbitofrontal cortex. Regions activated by personally familiar faces showed some overlap with regions of the left temporal pole that were activated by famous faces. Famous face activations extended more ventrally, although not to the ventral surface. Other regions of overlapping activations are reported in Table  . \n\nAlthough we found robust activations to famous and personally familiar faces in the ALE analysis, the activations did not extend into the ventral ATL in and around the anterior MTG, as is commonly reported in monkey fMRI studies. There are several inter-related cognitive explanations for this difference: familiar faces may activate more superior/polar regions of the ATL compared to non-familiar faces (which are most commonly used in monkey studies), due to their emotional, semantic, or verbal content. Alternatively, the subtraction used in the studies that make up the ALE analysis is famous/familiar faces minus unfamiliar faces which essentially leaves behind non-visual information such as proper names, biographical information including unique information for the famous individuals, episodic information (e.g., experiences with that person), and affective information, especially for the personally familiar faces. Thus, the observed ATL activations represent some combination of these non-visual factors. For example, the fact that the ATL activations to familiar vs. unfamiliar faces were left-lateralized might imply that verbal factors such as the retrieval of proper names made an important contribution (Fukatsu et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Glosser et al.,  ). \n\nA second more technical explanation is that neurons that are sensitive to familiar faces exist in the ventral ATL, but were not revealed by our meta-analysis due to signal drop out and distortion. Signal drop-out and distortion in the inferior surface and polar tip of the ATL are common and especially problematic when studies use a high TE and large voxel size. We selected studies for our ALE meta-analysis using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to optimize our ability to reveal activations in the ventral ATL if present. However, we can not rule out the possibility that a majority of the studies included in our meta-analyses were still subject to these technical issues. \n\nIn order to address this interpretive problem and provide converging evidence for our results, we conducted an fMRI study of person knowledge using an imaging protocol that was optimized for coverage in the ATL. We examined activations to novel faces, famous faces, and personally familiar faces. Collapsing across all face conditions, faces contrasted to landmarks activated a network that included bilateral ATLs. When the conditions were split apart, it was found that a small region of the right ventromedial ATL was sensitive to novel faces, while bilateral ventromedial ATL activations were observed to famous faces as compared to the baseline task. To examine the specific contribution of familiarity, we contrasted familiar faces with unfamiliar faces. Personally familiar faces were associated with left lateralized activations in the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula, and the temporal pole. The polar activation began in the anterior STS and extended into superior aspects of BA 38. Famous faces activated a more restricted set of voxels in the temporal pole that overlapped with the activations to personally familiar faces but extended more ventrally. \n\nOverall, the findings of the empirical study and meta-analysis were remarkably similar. Both studies showed a left-lateralized ATL sensitivity to two kinds of familiar faces. In addition, the only consistent overlap in activations in both studies to faces associated with knowledge was in the polar tip of the ATL. Optimized imaging parameters in our empirical study allowed us to see face-sensitive ATL activations in the ventral ATL, similar to what has been reported in studies of non-human primates. \n\n\n### Functional subdivisions and anatomical localization \n  \nSeveral authors have suggested that the ATL has discrete functional subregions (Moran et al.,  ; Ding et al.,  ; Martin,  ) and one such subregion may be a face selective region in the ventral ATL. fMRI studies in non-human primates have identified somewhat variable activation loci for faces, varying from the inferior bank of the STS on the lateral surface to the inferior surface of the ATL (Ku et al.,  ). In humans, two MVPA studies of facial identity using novel faces have also reported somewhat different loci in the right ventral ATL: one study reported an extremely medial peak in the uncus, possibly corresponding to perirhinal cortex (Nestor et al.,  ) while another study reported a peak in the anterior MTG (BA 21) (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). Our activations to novel faces are remarkably similar to that reported by Nestor and colleagues. The most ventral ATL peak to unfamiliar faces in our study was at 29, \u22125, \u221231. The most ventral peaks to familiar minus novel faces in our empirical study were left-lateralized and in a similar depth plane to that reported by Kriegeskorte, but slightly more anterior in BA 38 (famous vs. novel faces: \u221232, 14, \u221236; best friends vs. novel faces: \u221247, 11, \u221231). The most ventral peaks found in the empirical study were to famous faces minus novel landmarks on the surface of the ATL at left (\u221236, 6, \u221242) and right (35, 3, \u221242) locations. \n\nWe did not have any a priori hypotheses about lateralization. It is plausible that the left-lateralized activations to familiar faces in both the meta-analysis and empirical study reflect lexical features of these stimuli that are not present in unfamiliar faces. We note that this is consistent with the neuropsychology literature reviewed earlier (Gainotti,  ). \n\n\n### The specific role of the anterior temporal lobe in person memory \n  \nThere is widespread agreement that portions of the ATL play a mnemonic role in face processing, especially in face identification. It has been suggested that the ventral ATL face patch uses a population code to represent subtle differences between individual faces (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). The exact facial dimension that the ATL uses to do this is not known. What we do know is that cells in the macaque ventral ATL respond to changes in facial identity but not to perceptual changes that leave identity intact, such as rotation (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). Similarly, the BOLD signal in ventral ATL, including perirhinal cortex, is sensitive to changes to facial identity but not other types of perceptual changes such as color (Graham et al.,  ). \n\nThese same ventral ATL regions are up-regulated in the presence of conceptual information about faces such as personal familiarity, semantic uniqueness, or names (Barense et al.,  ; Eifuku et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ). Conceptual knowledge provides a powerful tool for abstracting over perceptual differences between items from the same class and highlighting differences between items from different classes. Conceptual knowledge, especially in the form of verbal labels, is a useful information-compression mechanism that allows us to carve up the perceptual world into the categories that are relevant to our behavior (Goldstone and Styvers,  ). Interestingly, researchers in the aphasia and semantic memory literature have proposed that portions of the ATL have an important role in storing and retrieving concrete concepts although there is disagreement about the precise nature of this role and the ATL subregion involved in this process (Patterson et al.,  ; Simmons and Martin,  ; Binder and Desai,  ). Our laboratory and others have reported that the superior bank of the anterior STS/superior-polar tip is preferentially sensitive to social concepts such as social words (e.g., \u201cfriendly\u201d) and vignettes that evoke theory of mind (Zahn et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ). The superior loci for these effects may reflect the connectivity of superior-polar regions of the ATL to neuromodulatory regions, the amygdala, and hypothalamus [see Olson et al. ( ) for a review]. Indeed one recent study proposed that the dorsal ATL is part of an \u201caffective\u201d system while the ventral ATL is part of a social perception system (Bickart et al.,  ). Bringing these literatures together, it seems plausible that the ventral ATL codes for facial identity by linking-specific faces to social semantic knowledge stored in more superior ATL regions. \n\nCells in the ventral ATL can associate specific faces to identifying information such as affective feelings, names, and biographical information by virtue of their association formation capabilities. In the early 90's it was reported that single neurons in the ventral ATL of monkeys that initially responded to only one abstract pattern, would later respond to a second abstract pattern that had been associated via training with the first (Sakai and Miyashita,  ). More recently it was shown that cells in the ventral ATL in monkeys can represent an trained associative pairing between faces and abstract patterns (Eifuku et al.,  ). Likewise, in humans it has been reported that successful encoding of person-related semantics with a proper name was associated with left ATL BOLD activity (Tsukiura et al.,  ). Even more compelling are findings showing that patients with left ATL lesions are unable to form new associations between names and pictures of objects (Sharon et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough our discussion thus far has emphasized face memory, it should be noted that face patches in the ATL are sensitive to novel faces (Tsao et al.,  ). Our findings also show this. Based on the sensitivity of this region to novel faces, it has also been argued that the ATL is part of a network for perceptual face discrimination (Nestor et al.,  ). We agree with this sentiment however we argue that this is the proverbial \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d since the properties of cells in this region appear to bridge perception and memory. Indeed, both components are required for accurate and rapid identification and there is a wealth of behavioral data showing that person identification is speeded by knowledge (e.g., Young et al.,  ,  ; Bruce and Valentine,  ). As noted earlier, cells in ventral ATL are only sensitive to certain perceptual manipulations such as changes in facial identity, but not to perceptual changes that leave identity intact (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). However, ventral ATL cells are acutely sensitive to different types of familiarity manipulations: responsiveness is enhanced by knowledge-base familiarity in the form of semantic knowledge (Nieuwenhuis et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ) but decreased by perceptual familiarity in the form of stimulus repetition (Sugiura et al.,  ,  ). The strong repetition suppression effect may underlie the familiarity signal reportedly lost after ATL damage (Bowles et al.,  ; Gainotti,  ). \n\nAlthough the response properties of cells in the ventral ATL might seem discordant, they in fact mirror important features of everyday experience with other individuals. On the one hand, when an individual is important to us we acquire knowledge about their name, interests, personality characteristics, and our emotional reactivity to them becomes more nuanced. On the other hand, there are individuals who we frequently see but we stop noticing, such as commuters on the 9 a.m. train, because they have no personal significance. Such   perceptual familiarity   is somewhat trivial when compared to the power exerted by knowledge on face identification. We propose that ATL face patches are active at both encoding and retrieval to integrate perceptual and mnemonic information to form a salience-tagged representation of different individuals. \n\n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 3561664, "text_md5": "45e7a90483e908c7269a15daf0809528", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 68], "journal": [69, 87], "publication_year": [89, 93], "title": [104, 171], "keywords": [185, 306], "abstract": [319, 1651], "body": [1660, 48620]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 23378834, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00017", "pmcid": "3561664", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561664", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3561664"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561664\">3561664</a>", "list_title": "PMC3561664  Anterior temporal face patches: a meta-analysis and empirical study"}

However, we currently lack consensus on where in the cerebellum, we find fine\u2010grained differentiation to unexpected sensory feedback. This may result from methodological diversity in task\u2010based human neuroimaging studies that experimentally alter the quality of self\u2010generated sensory feedback. We gathered existing studies that manipulated sensory feedback using a variety of methodological approaches and performed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analyses. Only half of these studies reported cerebellar activation with considerable variation in spatial location. Consequently, ALE analyses did not reveal significantly increased likelihood of activation in the cerebellum despite the broad scientific consensus of the cerebellum's involvement. In light of the high degree of methodological variability in published studies, we tested for statistical dependence between methodological factors that varied across the published studies. Experiments that elicited an adaptive response to continuously altered sensory feedback more frequently reported activation in the cerebellum than those experiments that did not induce adaptation. These findings may explain the surprisingly low rate of significant cerebellar activation across brain imaging studies investigating unexpected sensory feedback. Furthermore, limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe the cerebellum could play a role as climbing fiber activity associated with feedback error processing may not be captured by it. We provide methodological recommendations that may guide future studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nTo successfully act within a dynamic environment, we continuously monitor sensory feedback associated with our own movements to ensure our actions have the desired outcomes. Even the simplest movements require complex coordination between multiple effectors. The continuous monitoring of sensory feedback helps to refine motor plans and adjust them to contextual and environmental changes. The forward model is a computational process that compares expected to actual sensory consequences of an action (see Figure  ; Jordan & Rumelhart,  ; Miall & Wolpert,  ; Wolpert,  ). This comparison is essential to motor control and relies partly on the cerebellum (Blakemore, Frith, & Wolpert,  ; Ishikawa, Tomatsu, Izawa, & Kakei,  ; Ito,  ; Kawato, Furukawa, & Suzuki,  ; Miall, Weir, Wolpert, & Stein,  ; Wolpert, Miall, & Kawato,  ). However, there is still no strong consensus on where in the cerebellum unexpected sensory feedback is processed. To this end, the current meta\u2010analysis systematically explores patterns of cerebellar activation in neuroimaging studies of sensory feedback manipulations. Such manipulations create an artificial mismatch between intended and perceived sensory consequences of an action, constituting methods commonly used to probe forward models in brain imaging studies. \n  \nComponents of a forward model. A diagram which outlines five major components of a Forward Model. The \u201cMotor Plan\u201d incorporates the components (1) \u201cEfference Copy\u201d and (2) \u201cMotor Command.\u201d The implantation of the Motor Command leads to (3) \u201cObserved Sensory Feedback.\u201d The efference copy is an expectation of sensory consequences of the enactment of the motor plan, providing (4) \u201cPredicted Sensory Feedback.\u201d The Observed Sensory Feedback and the Predicted Sensory Feedback are compared. If they do not match, an (5) \u201cError Signal\u201d indicating violation of the expected consequences is returned for updating of the motor plan. The \u201cObserved Sensory Feedback\u201d can also notify the \u201cPredicted Sensory Feedback\u201d with contextual information of body or environment in order to make temporary changes to the prediction rather than updating the motor plan. This is denoted as \u201cDynamic assessment of state\u201d \n  \nA fundamental component of the forward model is the   efference copy  : when the motor cortex sends a command to the peripheral nervous system for the execution of motor behavior, a copy of the command is fed forward to provide an estimate of the sensorimotor feedback predicted from the movement (von Holst & Mittelstaedt,  ). The predicted feedback is compared to the actual feedback from the proprioceptive (Miall & Wolpert,  ; Wolpert et al.,  ), visual (Leube et al.,  ), auditory (Hashimoto & Sakai,  ), and tactile (Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith,  ) sensory periphery. Any discrepancy between predicted and actual feedback constitutes an output known as a corollary discharge (Feinberg,  ). The resultant error signal is processed by the cerebellum, ultimately resulting in an output to cortical areas to adaptively fine\u2010tune behavior. As both the state of the organism and the environment are dynamic, forward models are employed continuously to reduce any discrepancy between predicted and actual feedback through constant monitoring and adjustment of behavior (Desmurget & Grafton,  ; Jordan & Rumelhart,  ). \n\nThe cerebellar cortex comprises overlapping functional zones that process input from specific sensory modalities (Witter & De Zeeuw,  ). Specific areas respond to auditory or visual stimuli (O'Reilly, Beckmann, Tomassini, Ramnani, & Johansen\u2010Berg,  ; Petacchi, Laird, Fox, & Bower,  ; Sang et al.,  ). Likewise, portions of the cerebellum segment into somatomotor topographies associated with the control of different body parts (Buckner, Krienen, Castellanos, Diaz, & Yeo,  ; Mottolese et al.,  ). These divisions are coupled to associated subdivisions of motor cortex responsible for controlling the same body parts. The motor areas contribute cortical input to communication loops between the cortex and cerebellum employed in ongoing motor control. Therefore, the cerebellar cortex receives two principle types of afferents: mossy fibers primarily via the pons which relay information such as the efference copy from corresponding cortical regions (Raymond, Lisberger, & Mauk,  ), while medullary nuclei relay bottom\u2010up sensory feedback\u2010related signals and induce changes in the influence of cortical top\u2010down signals to the cerebellar cortex (Ito, Sakurai, & Tongroach,  ). The inferior olive monitors the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory input and relays an error signal to the cerebellum via climbing fibers (Ito,  ; Kawato & Gomi,  ). The cerebellum also receives signals of unpredicted auditory feedback from the dorsal cochlear nuclei of the medulla (Schwartze & Kotz,  ). In turn, the cerebellum continuously signals the discrepancy back to the cerebral cortex to induce adaptation of motor behavior until the expected feedback matches the actual sensory feedback. \n\nIn order to guide the complex task of adapting behavior to resolve discrepancy between expected and actual sensory feedback, the cerebellum must communicate and coordinate with multiple areas of the cerebral cortex. All output from the cerebellum, such as from the processing of the corollary discharge, are issued via deep cerebellar nuclei (Middleton & Strick,  ), connecting to regions such as the prefrontal cortex (Allen et al.,  ; Balsters et al.,  ; Kelly & Strick,  ; Middleton & Strick,  ; Ramnani,  ; Watson, Becker, Apps, & Jones,  ), motor areas (Akkal, Dum, & Strick,  ; Balsters et al.,  ; Dum & Strick,  ; Kelly & Strick,  ; Lu, Miyachi, & Takada,  ; Wise & Strick,  ), and parietal area (Allen et al.,  ; Clower, West, Lynch, & Strick,  ; Prevosto, Graf, & Ugolini,  ; Ramnani,  ). The cerebellum and these frontal and parietal areas also create loops where reciprocal exchange of information can be continuously fed through a cortico\u2010cerebellar system to allow for continuous adaptation of motor activity (Watson et al.,  ). \n\nA common experimental approach to study neural substrates that implement processes related to the forward model is to manipulate the sensorimotor feedback of self\u2010generated movements. In these experiments, participants typically produce articulatory or manual movements while feedback is altered. For example, studies have investigated how the brain responds to unpredicted feedback by manipulating the acoustic properties of one's own voice (Tourville, Reilly, & Guenther,  ; Zheng et al.,  ), by introducing illusory visual displacement of the hand or a mechanically controlled avatar (David et al.,  ; Diedrichsen, Hashambhoy, Rane, & Shadmehr,  ; Schnell et al.,  ), or by applying an unpredicted external physical force (Diedrichsen et al.,  ; Golfinopoulos et al.,  ). Therefore, there can be much variability in how this mechanism is studied in neuroimaging research in terms of form of motor production, feedback manipulation, and sensory modality of feedback. It was our intention to evaluate over the body of literature eliciting activity in response to various manipulations of self\u2010generated sensory feedback any common areas reported in the brain, with specific interest in finding consensus on the regions of the cerebellum involved. We conducted three activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta\u2010analyses of functional neuroimaging studies to identify patterns of neural activation that are reliably affected by these manipulations. A primary analysis was expected to yield a modality independent but anatomically precise global impression of cerebellar contributions to processes related to the forward model. Two secondary ALE analyses were conducted to differentiate this impression in terms of potential modality\u2010specific components, as well as a contrast analysis between auditory and visual feedback results. This distinction is made as although higher processing cortical areas may be responsive irrespective of the sensory modality, there is cerebellar and cortical distinction between areas responsive to auditory and visuomotor feedback manipulations. In doing so, we may shed light on a consensus of where the cerebellum is involved in processing feedback error, and specifically if the cerebellum is more reliably probed in areas segregated for auditory or visual sensory input. Additionally, due to the high diversity in methods across this body of literature, we aimed to further investigate the dependency of cerebellar activity reported on the factors which most commonly varied across the experiments selected for our meta\u2010analyses. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \nWe generally followed recent best practice guidelines for the conducting of neuroimaging meta\u2010analyses (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). These guidelines have been put forward to improve the transparency and replicability of meta\u2010analyses. We accordingly report information advised such as research question, inclusion and exclusion criteria, detailed information for all experiments, and a step\u2010by\u2010step flowchart (see Figure  ). \n  \nMeta\u2010analysis flowchart. A flowchart diagram recommended in the best practice guidelines for the conducting of neuroimaging meta\u2010analyses (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). The flowchart lists eight sections.

(6) Conversion of coordinates into the same reference space. (7) Calculation of meta\u2010analyses. (8) Transparent reporting. Each section outlines all relevant information for the study in order to provide the reader with all necessary information for replication \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nThe PubMed ( ) database was searched for human neuroimaging studies using combinations of relevant keywords (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], positron emission tomography [PET], sensorimotor learning, adaptation, and shifted\u2010, delayed\u2010, altered\u2010, masked\u2010, incongruent\u2010, and distorted feedback). We further cross\u2010referenced the articles produced from the search term to corroborate that no relevant articles were overlooked. Studies were selected if they reported activation contrasts of unpredicted (manipulated) compared to predicted (non\u2010manipulated) self\u2010generated feedback, data acquisition covered the whole brain encompassing the cerebellum, and included tables listing peak activations in standard stereotaxic space. Only data from healthy adult participants were selected. Results reported in Talairach space (Talairarch & Tournoux,  ) were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (Holmes et al.,  ) using the GingerALE (2.3.6) icbm2tal conversion algorithm (Lancaster et al.,  ). This search yielded experiments from 36 studies, reporting a total of 368 foci of activation from 601 participants, including 16 studies of manipulated auditory feedback from vocalizations or button\u2010presses, and 20 studies of manipulated visual feedback of hand movements. Details of the included studies are in Table  . \n  \nStudies included in meta\u2010analysis \n    \n\n### ALE analyses \n  \nThe software package GingerALE (2.3.6) was used to perform three analyses on coordinates for peak activations derived from the studies identified by the literature search ( ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Three single set ALE and one contrast analysis were conducted. ALE computes the likelihood of a voxel for being a source of activation within the set of studies across the whole brain. A primary ALE analysis was conducted on the full dataset of 38 experiments from the 36 studies included, using a cluster forming threshold of   p   <\u2009.001 and 1,000 random permutations with a cluster\u2010level correction of   p   <\u2009.05. These parameters were chosen as they were the recommended threshold settings for the cluster\u2010level multiple test correction listed in the GingerALE software user guidelines. This analysis was performed to identify concordant activations regardless of the feedback modality. A secondary set of ALE analyses was conducted separately on a dataset of 17 experiments from the 16 studies with manipulated auditory feedback, and on 21 experiments from the 20 studies with manipulated visual feedback. Identical cluster forming threshold and correction parameters for the first ALE were applied to the auditory and visual dataset analyses. Contrast analyses were performed comparing auditory and visual ALE results applying a False Discovery Rate assuming independence or positive dependence (FDR pID) of 0.01, with threshold parameters as recommended in the GingerALE manual. \n\n\n### Tests of independence \n  \nWe investigated the relative success of the most commonly applied experimental designs to engage the cerebellum. To this end, we categorized the studies in our dataset by sensory modality (visual vs. auditory), acquisition methods (blocked vs. event\u2010related design), response to manipulated feedback (adaption vs. no\u2010adaptation), and type of feedback manipulation (temporal, spatially or acoustically shifted, masked, mismatched, or physical perturbation). Adaptation studies are categorized as eliciting adjustment in response to sustained manipulation of feedback, where the fine\u2010tuning of motor commands may be relevant to the success of future action. This differs from automatic compensatory responses to brief changes in feedback that do not inform successive behavior. We tested whether the presence of significant activation within the cerebellum was associated with these methodological factors with a chi\u2010squared test of independence applying the Yates correction of continuity using SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Significance thresholds were set at   p   <\u2009.05. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Manipulated feedback: ALE analyses \n  \nThe primary ALE identified five clusters (Table  a and Figure  a). The largest cluster was centered medially in the superior frontal gyrus extending into the right and left supplementary motor area (SMA) (BA 6). There were two right lateralized clusters in the precentral gyrus (preCG) (BA 9) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis (BA 44), as well as two left hemisphere clusters in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (BA 40) and SMA (BA 6). The secondary ALE on auditory feedback manipulation identified six clusters, centered at the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) (BA 22) and right STG (BA 41), with four additional right lateralized clusters at the SMA (BA 6), IFG pars opercularis (BA 44), SMG (BA 40), and primary motor cortex (M1) (BA 4) (Table  b and Figure  b). The secondary ALE on visual feedback manipulation also identified six clusters, centered at the right preCG (BA 6), left hemisphere frontal eye fields (BA 8) and SMA (BA 6), as well as right lateralized clusters at the preCG (BA 6), extrastriate body area (EBA) (BA 37), and SMA (BA 6) (Table  c and Figure  c). Remarkably, both the primary and secondary ALE analyses failed to identify clusters of activation in the cerebellum. \n  \nALE results \n      \n(a) Sensory feedback error ALE.

As no cerebellar clusters were produced in either of the ALE analyses, the contrast analysis did not produce any valuable comparisons of modality specific cerebellar clusters. At a cortical level, the auditory compared to visual ALE cluster contrast produced two clusters in the left and right STG specifically for auditory and not visual feedback error. No significant clusters were found for visual and auditory feedback errors nor any common regions between modality in a conjunction of both ALE analyses clusters (see Supplementary Materials  ). \n\n\n### Relationship between experimental design and cerebellar activation \n  \nTo determine whether certain methodological differences were linked with being more likely to activate the cerebellum we conducted chi\u2010squared tests of independence for four common design features in which experiments differed from one another. With an a priori significance threshold set to   p   <\u2009.05, finding cerebellar activation was not contingent on sensory modality (  p   =\u2009.243), manipulation type (  p   =\u2009.306), or acquisition method (  p   =\u2009.071). However, cerebellar activation was contingent on adaptation (  p   =\u2009.005). Then, 14 of 18 studies (78%) that elicited adaption responses reported significant activation in the cerebellum. In summary, of the four factors tested, cerebellar activation proved to depend significantly on the need for adaptation. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe conducted three meta\u2010analyses of neuroimaging studies that altered sensory feedback during ongoing movements with the aim of localizing the cerebellar contributions to processes related to the forward model. In doing so, we attempted to reconcile an apparent lack of consensus of the role of the cerebellum in experiments of unexpected changes to sensory consequences of our own action. Contrary to our expectations and to broad scientific consensus suggesting that the cerebellum is involved in this process, we did not observe a convergence of activation foci in the cerebellum, although the analyses successfully identified the expected network of cortical areas. We therefore systematically assessed methodological factors that could potentially increase the likelihood of specific experimental designs to activate the cerebellum. Our findings confirm that studies that require adaptation of behavior in response to sensory feedback manipulations most reliably evoke cerebellar activation. \n\n### Responses to unpredicted feedback \n  \n#### Cerebral cortex \n  \nThe primary ALE analysis of the manipulated sensory feedback dataset indicated clusters in the SMA, preCG, IFG, STG, and TPJ. Two of the clusters, the SMA and preCG, were centered in the right secondary motor cortex, regions associated with the production of an efference copy for assessing sensory consequences of movement (Christensen et al.,  ; Ellaway, Prochazka, Chan, & Gauthier,  ; Haggard & Whitford,  ). The cluster centered at the IFG and extending into the prefrontal frontal regions incorporates areas which lend themselves to a broader self\u2010awareness network and are thought to reflect agency over action (David, Newen, & Vogeley,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Jardri et al.,  ; Leube et al.,  ; Nahab et al.,  ). The right IFG plays a role in detecting cues which are relevant to inhibiting motor activity (Corbetta & Shulman,  ; Hampshire, Chamberlain, Monti, Duncan, & Owen,  ) and in subsequent reorienting and updating of action plans (Levy & Wagner,  ). The cluster centered in the TPJ extends into much of the IPL, which is associated with monitoring motor outflow (Desmurget & Sirigu,  ; Sirigu et al.,  ), as well as with awareness of consistency of intended and actual motor consequences (Farrer et al.,  ), where activity is higher when another agent is active (Decety, Chaminade, Grezes, & Meltzoff,  ; Farrer & Frith,  ; Ruby & Decety,  ). The TPJ has been shown to be active in response to changes in visual and auditory stimuli that are task\u2010relevant (Downar, Crawley, Mikulis, & Davis,  ). Almost all clusters identified by the full dataset primary ALE comprised foci from both auditory and visual studies, suggesting a multisensory network. This asserts that some cortical areas process error in both auditory and visual self\u2010generated feedback. The cluster centered in the left STG however was an exception, with only foci contributed from auditory studies. \n\nAnalyses of the auditory subset ALE revealed bilateral STG activation. These auditory cortical processing areas have shown a stronger response to auditory stimuli initiated by others than by oneself (Christoffels et al.,  ; Curio et al.,  ; Heinks\u2010Maldonado, Mathalon, Gray, & Ford,  ; Houde, Nagarajan, Sekihara, & Merzenich,  ; Knolle, Schr\u00f6ger, Baess, & Kotz,  ; Numminen & Curio,  ). Increased activation of auditory cortex has also been correlated with the degree of delay in auditory feedback in speech production (Hashimoto & Sakai,  ) and in response to sound masking compared to expected auditory feedback (Christoffels et al.,  ). Likewise, there was a large medial cluster in the auditory subset in the right SMA. The SMA has been suggested to play a role in auditory sensorimotor associations, for example, in using auditory information to elicit automatic motor responses (Lima, Krishnan, & Scott,  ) and auditory conditioning in a motor task (Kurata, Tsuji, Naraki, Seino, & Abe,  ). \n\nStudies that manipulated visual feedback were more likely to activate the premotor cortex of the right preCG, and a cluster in the EBA extending into the IPL. The EBA is involved in the visual processing of perceiving the human body (Downing, Jiang, Shuman, & Kanwisher,  ; Peelen & Downing,  ), of goal\u2010directed action of body parts (Astafiev, Stanley, Shulman, & Corbetta,  ), and in processing incoherent human biological motion sequences (Downing, Peelen, Wiggett, & Tew,  ). David et al. ( ) suggest that the EBA may be part of a larger network including posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and the cerebellum, that is involved in correcting sensorimotor discrepancy. The IPL engages in the monitoring and comparison of one's own action and the visual feedback that it generates (Schnell et al.,  ), and in visuomotor incongruencies (Balslev et al.,  ), reported as well more broadly in the parietal cortex (Fink et al.,  ; Shimada, Hiraki, & Oda,  ). \n\n\n#### Cerebellum \n  \nDespite a strong consensus suggesting that forward models generally rely on the cerebellum (Bastian,  ; Ishikawa et al.,  ; Ito,  ; Kawato & Gomi,  ; Wolpert et al.,  ), cerebellar activations were reported in only half of the 38 experiments that formed the dataset for the current analyses. The majority of these activations were localized in lobules VI and VIII. Cerebellar lobule VI contains overlapping functional zones that are sensitive to auditory and visual stimulation while a functional zone of lobule VIII is associated with sensorimotor processing (O'Reilly et al.,  ; Sang et al.,  ). The cerebellum receives climbing fiber inputs from the sensory periphery and corticopontocerebellar mossy fiber inputs from cortical motor areas. The cerebellar cortex is arranged into functional modules which act as points of convergence of these inputs (Odeh, Ackerley, Bjaalie, & Apps,  ). These modules in turn send cerebellothalamocortical projections back up to the corresponding cortical motor areas to inform further movements (Palesi et al.,  ). Through functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in humans, there have been efforts to accurately map the functional segmentation of the cerebellum to their corresponding cortical regions (Allen et al.,  ; Habas et al.,  ; Krienen & Buckner,  ; O'Reilly et al.,  ). For example, Buckner et al. ( ) performed functional connectivity analyses on data from 1,000 participants to provide a comprehensive view of all cerebellar connections with cortex. Their results provide strong evidence for two somatomotor homunculi in the anterior and posterior lobes. The anterior map is centered on lobule VI, while the posterior is centered on lobule VIII. The majority of cerebellar activations in studies included in our analyses were reported in lobules VI (Brand et al.,  ; Diedrichsen et al.,  ; Grafton et al.,  ; Graydon et al.,  ; Inoue et al.,  ; Pfordresher et al.,  ; Tunik et al.,  ; Yomogida et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ), and VIII (Anguera et al.,  ; Krakauer et al.,  ; Pfordresher et al.,  ; Tourville et al.,  ). This demonstrates that where cerebellar activations were observed they were not distributed randomly, making these findings unlikely to be false positives. \n\nThe majority of activations in the cerebellum reflecting fine\u2010tuning motor control will be predominately in either of these two somatotopically organized lobules. However, in the ALE analyses, we do not see clustering at each of those regions. The reason for this may be due to the histological organization of the cerebellum. Its structure is completely uniform in its cortex, made up of repeating modules intermixed and overlapping with modules of separate function, having no integral borders (Ito,  ). This can lead to a lack of clear separation of focal activity for one specific function. For instance, electrical stimulation at different sites within the cerebellum can induce contraction of the same muscles (Mottolese et al.,  ), while stimulating areas directly adjacent to responsive areas for movement of a body part would cause no movement at all. This creates a difficult picture to deconstruct, where representations in the cerebellum may be very spatially specific, where there may be multiple representations for movement of one body part, and if so where these representations may be sparsely distributed. For these reasons although many studies will report cerebellar activation in response to the same contrast, attempting to find meaningful clusters of functional localization common across studies may be limited. \n\n\n\n### Considerations for reliable probing of the forward model \n  \nAlthough all studies included in this meta\u2010analysis contrasted experimental conditions of manipulated feedback with non\u2010manipulated feedback, there was a considerable degree of diversity in methodology. Experiments varied in terms of feedback modality, the quality and quantity of the feedback manipulation, whether participants were able to adapt behavior, and whether similar experimental trials were blocked together or intermixed. \n\n#### Choice of feedback manipulation \n  \nThere was considerable variability in the way that different studies implemented manipulations of sensory feedback from self\u2010produced action. The most common feedback manipulations employed delays, a mismatch leading to an abrupt loss of control over feedback, noise masking, spectral shifting of auditory feedback or spatial shifting of visual feedback, and the physical application of an external force. The relative amount of cerebellar foci contributing to the study pool from different forms of manipulations differed accordingly. For example, shifted and feedback mismatch studies were twice as likely to elicit cerebellar activity than not (12/18 and 4/6), while temporal manipulations only elicited cerebellar activity in a quarter of the respective experiments (2/8). Among studies that implemented a continuous shift of feedback, six activations were in lobule VI (Brand et al.,  ; Diedrichsen et al.,  ; Grafton et al.,  ; Graydon et al.,  ; Inoue et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ), three in lobule VIII (Anguera et al.,  ; Krakauer et al.,  ; Tourville et al.,  ), with two foci just anterior to Lobule VI in the IV/V region (Anguera et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ), and two in Crus I/II (Krakauer et al.,  ). The same regions were reported for studies of mismatched feedback, with three foci incorporated in Lobule VI (Pfordresher et al.,  ; Tunik et al.,  ; Yomogida et al.,  ), two in Crus II (Pfordresher et al.,  ; Schnell et al.,  ), and one in Lobule VIII (Pfordresher et al.,  ). However, there was no significant statistical contingency shown between type of manipulation and the report of cerebellar activity in our test of independence analyses. \n\n\n#### Motor response or motor disturbance \n  \nFeedback manipulations can either elicit an adjustment to feedback or disrupt movement altogether. For instance, there is a tendency to speak louder when auditory feedback is masked (Lane & Tranel,  ; Lombard,  ) or to speak more quietly when auditory feedback is amplified (Chang\u2010Yit, Pick Jr, & Siegel,  ). In both cases, feedback from the auditory periphery is at an unpredicted level and motor behavior is adapted accordingly. Likewise, by applying an external physical force to speech effectors (Abbs & Gracco,  ; Gomi, Honda, Ito, & Murano,  ; Honda, Fujino, & Kaburagi,  ; Saltzman, L\u00f6fqvist, Kay, Kinsella\u2010Shaw, & Rubin,  ; Shaiman & Gracco,  ), or shifting the frequency or pitch of feedback (Donath, Natke, & Kalveram,  ; Elman,  ; Houde & Jordan,  ,  ; Jones & Munhall,  ; Larson, Burnett, Kiran, & Hain,  ; Natke, Donath, & Kalveram,  ; Purcell & Munhall,  ; Xu, Larson, Bauer, & Hain,  ; Zarate, Wood, & Zatorre,  ; Zarate & Zatorre,  ), automatic compensation responses are elicited as the speaker attempts to reach their intended auditory targets of their natural sounding speech. These responses of automatic compensation differ from adaptation as they are instantaneous shifts to counteract perturbation, while adaptation can be a conscious process of adjusting motor commands for future behavior in response to continuous change of sensory feedback. \n\nHigh magnitude manipulations may cause feedback to be perceived as entirely outside a range of control of the actor, and thus no longer triggering an automatic compensation in motor production. This stems from the theory that our sense of agency over sensory feedback from the environment is dependent on the magnitude of discrepancy between the predictable consequences of our own action and the unpredictable external influences of sensory input (David et al.,  ). For example, singers can successfully suppress the automatic compensation response when the pitch of their voice is shifted by a large amount, but not when a smaller shift is applied (Zarate & Zatorre,  ). The duration of manipulated feedback also influences compensation responses. Pitch shifts with short durations prompted automatic adjustments while pitch shifts with longer durations were more easily ignored (Burnett, Freedland, Larson, & Hain,  ; Hain et al.,  ; Zarate et al.,  ; Zarate & Zatorre,  ). Some forms of feedback can disrupt movement altogether. By applying delayed auditory feedback (DAF), speech and musical performance are interrupted (Black,  ; Fukawa, Yoshioka, Ozawa, & Yoshida,  ; Havlicek,  ; Howell & Powell,  ; Lee,  ; Mackay,  ; Siegel, Schork, Pick, & Garber,  ). The magnitude of delay is also an important consideration, with DAF of approximately 200\u2009ms being the most disruptive (Fairbanks & Guttman,  ; Hashimoto & Sakai,  ; Stuart, Kalinowski, Rastatter, & Lynch,  ). Further increase of delay may lead to similar disregard of feedback as irrelevant to the agency of the actor. \n\n\n#### Adaptation to changes in feedback \n  \nUnpredicted feedback informs not only adjustments to ongoing movements, but also updates predictions for future movements by means of adaptation. This response to changes in environmental feedback is a form of motor learning and differs qualitatively from motor sequence learning (Doyon, Penhune, & Ungerleider,  ). This type of motor learning therefor must not be seen as planning new coordinated motor plans, and instead viewed specifically as reoptimization that seeks to minimize future costs to the motor system by forming more accurate predictions of existing motor plans (Izawa, Rane, Donchin, & Shadmehr,  ). Across the studies in our analyses, cerebellar foci were most common in studies driving adaptation in response to physical perturbation of the mouth (Golfinopoulos et al.,  ) and arm (Diedrichsen et al.,  ), learning new associations between the spatial consequences of movement when visual feedback is shifted (Anguera et al.,  ; Brand et al.,  ; Diedrichsen et al.,  ; Grafton et al.,  ; Graydon et al.,  ; Inoue et al.,  ; Krakauer et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ), and when vocal pitch was shifted during continuous speech (Tourville et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ). All of these manipulations evoke the fine\u2010tuning of accurately predicting movement outcomes in response to changes in the environment (Ishikawa et al.,  ). Indeed, adaptation was found to be the only factor in our analyses that showed a significant dependency with the elicitation of cerebellar activation. \n\nThe cerebellum plays an important role in adapting future predictions in light of error. Cerebellar patients are able to react to changes to feedback (Morton & Bastian,  ; Smith, Brandt, & Shadmehr,  ), but are unable adapt by calibrating their predictions for subsequent behavior (Maschke, Gomez, Ebner, & Konczak,  ; Morton & Bastian,  ; Smith & Shadmehr,  ). This suggests that adjustments to feedback, which inform subsequent fine\u2010tuning, require cerebellar engagement. Monkeys with experimental lesions to areas of the cerebellum which receive mossy fibers from cortex such as the posterior lobe parafloculus and uvula are unable to adapt to changes in feedback (Baizer, Kralj\u2010Hans, & Glickstein,  ). Inactivation of deep cerebellar nuclei impairs adaptation to physical and visuomotor perturbation (Kerr, Miall & Stein,  ). Cerebellar activity may change over time as the system moves from a state of adapting predictions that have failed, to executing predictions that have been adapted (Gilbert & Thach,  ). \n\nThe effect of activation of the cerebellar cortex on adaptation has been reported as well in humans. Cerebellar excitation in transcranial direct current stimulation can lead to faster adaptation to visuomotor feedback transformation (Galea, Vazquez, Pasricha, de Xivry, & Celnik,  ; Jayaram, Tang, Pallegadda, Vasudevan, Celnik, & Amy Bastian,  ). Moreover, activity in the cerebellum is greatest immediately after conditions in the environment change (e.g., when feedback is first manipulated) but decreases over time (Friston, Frith, Passingham, Liddle, & Frackowiak,  ; Nezafat, Shadmehr, & Holcomb,  ). This has strong implications for the choice of design in experiments seeking to probe the cerebellum's involvement in the forward model. \n\n\n\n### The implications of fMRI \n  \n#### Neurovascular coupling in the cerebellum \n  \nThe blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) response that is measured by fMRI may not be sensitive to some of the neural processes of sensory feedback error in the cerebellum. The BOLD response is correlated with local field potentials (LFP) rather than the spiking rate of neurons (Ekstrom,  ), which has implications for fMRI studies of the cerebellum. Mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellum synapse thousands of Purkinje cells via parallel fibers and strongly influence LFP, leading to strong increases in the BOLD signal. Climbing fibers communicate via one\u2010to\u2010one inputs to Purkinje cells and are thus poorly coupled to the BOLD signal. Experiments that drive cerebellar activity via bottom\u2010up climbing fiber error signals may be unsuited to measurement by fMRI, whereas experiments that drive cerebellar activity via mossy fiber inputs may lead to detectable BOLD responses (Diedrichsen, Verstynen, Schlerf, & Wiestler,  ). This is consistent with the view that the mossy fiber input system is more strongly associated with processes of motor learning in adapting to sensorimotor prediction errors (Giovannucci et al.,  ; Ito,  ; Thach,  ). \n\n\n#### Choice of experimental design \n  \nOur findings suggest that some experimental fMRI designs are more appropriately suited to elicit BOLD responses in the cerebellum. Designs that prevent participants from habituating to altered feedback, and continually cause them to adapt their motor responses, may be most effective in eliciting a detectable BOLD response. McGuire et al. ( ) illustrate habituation in block designs as they observed increased activation of the cerebellum during the first half of their study, but not in the latter half. This is consistent with the broader finding that the cerebellum may be more strongly engaged in adjusting to altered feedback than applying adjustments that have already been computed (Andersson & Armstrong,  ; Flament, Ellermann, Kim, U\u01e7urbil, & Ebner,  ; Horn, Pong, & Gibson,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ; Moberget, Gullesen, Andersson, Ivry, & Endestad,  ). However, the arrangement instead of fast cycling between trials of different conditions in event\u2010related designs may hinder adaptation responses if feedback is not consistent from trial to trial. Long events of consistent perturbation (e.g., Christoffels et al.,  ; Grafton et al.,  ; Limanowski et al.,  ) or similarly with short blocks (e.g., Inoue et al.,  ; McGuire et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ) may be best suited for probing processes related to the forward model associated BOLD response in the cerebellum. \n\n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nWe performed three ALE meta\u2010analyses and one contrast analysis of functional neuroimaging studies that manipulated predicted self\u2010initiated auditory, visual, and sensory feedback with the primary aim to identify cerebellar areas responsive to prediction error. No cerebellar clusters were produced as a result of these analyses. Contrary to common presumptions, we found that not all studies that used such approach show significant activation of the cerebellum, as well as variability in where in the cerebellum activations were reported. Our study suggests that this discrepancy stems from differential sensitivity and specific limitations of the experimental paradigms employed across MR neuroimaging altered sensory feedback experiments. These method\u2010specific characteristics can restrict compatibility with other frameworks, which overwhelmingly support the involvement of the cerebellum in responding to errors in predicted feedback as part of the forward model. We therefore assessed methodological variations that may determine the success of brain imaging experiments in evoking cerebellar activation. The results indicate that experimental designs which most reliably evoked cerebellar activation employed continuous feedback manipulations relevant for adapting motor plans for future action. Due to constraints of neurovascular coupling in cerebellar activity, it is possible that only mossy fiber inputs in response to adaptation elicit demonstrable BOLD signals, while error signals conveyed via climbing fiber spike firing increase may not suitable for fMRI testing. The results further suggest that short\u2010blocked designs may offer the most effective approach, engaging a period of adaptation to changes in feedback without reaching a state of habituation, leading to reliable activation of the cerebellum. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors state no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6771970, "text_md5": "0e83a9036f15b93c8f4865086dbde903", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 99], "journal": [100, 114], "publication_year": [116, 120], "title": [131, 216], "keywords": [230, 302], "abstract": [315, 2001], "body": [2010, 43059]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31155815, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.24681", "pmcid": "6771970", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6771970", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6771970"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6771970\">6771970</a>", "list_title": "PMC6771970  The role of the cerebellum in adaptation: ALE meta\u2010analyses on sensory feedback error"}

Despite its high prevalence and early age of onset, our understanding of the potentially unique neural basis of MDD in this age group is still not well understood, and the existing primary literature on the topic includes many new and divergent results. This limited understanding of MDD in youth presents a critical need to further investigate its neural basis in youth and presents an opportunity to also improve clinical treatments that target its neural abnormalities. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nThe present study aims to advance our understanding of the neural basis of MDD in youth by identifying abnormal functional activation in various brain regions compared with healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of MDD by using a well-established method, multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) with ensemble thresholding, to quantitatively combine all existing whole-brain fMRI studies of MDD in youth compared with healthy controls. This method involves a voxel-wise, whole-brain approach, that compares neural activation of patients with MDD to age-matched healthy controls across variations of task-based conditions, which we subcategorize into affective processing, executive functioning, positive valence, negative valence, and symptom provocation tasks. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nYouth with MDD exhibited statistically significant (p<0.05; FWE-corrected) hyperactivation and hypoactivation in multiple brain regions compared with age-matched healthy controls. These results include significant effects that are stable across various tasks as well as some that appear to depend on task conditions. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study strengthens our understanding of the neural basis of MDD in youth and may also be used to help identify possible similarities and differences between youth and adults with depression. It may also help inform the development of new treatment interventions and tools for predicting unique treatment responses in youth with depression. \n\n\n## Disclosure of Interest \n  \nNone Declared \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"id": 10595821, "text_md5": "99659ddec2edbf22a1310a6a8a9138e1", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 299], "journal": [300, 314], "publication_year": [316, 320], "title": [331, 431], "keywords": [445, 445], "abstract": [458, 2724], "body": [2733, 2733]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.512", "pmcid": "10595821", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10595821", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10595821"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10595821\">10595821</a>", "list_title": "PMC10595821  Major Depressive Disorder in Youth: A Meta-Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies"}

Based on recent research, an alternative non-selective mechanism was proposed by several authors. Presumably, the inhibitory brain activity may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by any imperative stimuli, including Go stimuli, when the context is uncertain. Earlier support for this notion was mainly based on the absence of a significant difference between neural activity evoked by equiprobable Go and NoGo stimuli. Equiprobable Go/NoGo design with a simple response time task limits potential confounds between response inhibition and accompanying cognitive processes while not preventing prepotent automaticity. However, previous neuroimaging studies used classical null hypothesis significance testing, making it impossible to accept the null hypothesis. Therefore, the current research aimed to provide evidence for the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials using Bayesian analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Thirty-four healthy participants performed a cued Go/NoGo task with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. To independently localize brain areas associated with response inhibition in similar experimental conditions, we performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal-probability Go/NoGo tasks. As a result, we observed overlap between response inhibition areas and areas that demonstrate the practical equivalence of neuronal activity located in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, obtained results favour the existence of non-selective response inhibition, which can act in settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResponse inhibition is the ability to suppress inappropriate, automatic, reflexive, or habitual prepotent responses to produce a controlled goal-directed response . It is generally accepted in the literature that response inhibition works in close relation to other processes associated with cognitive control, such as working memory, voluntary attention, conflict monitoring, and action selection . Moreover, response inhibition is thought to represent a multifaceted phenomenon rather than a unitary brain mechanism. A distinction is made between action cancellation and action restraint  as well as between reactive and proactive response inhibition mechanisms . \n\nAccording to the conventional view, the response inhibition process is selectively triggered by \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli that result in increased neuronal activity in brain structures responsible for inhibitory control . However, in several cases, the concept of selective response inhibition fails to explain observed behavioural and neurophysiological phenomena. Manipulating the probability of the occurrence of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli and the subjects\u2019 awareness of the probability of the appearance may slow down the motor response . Moreover, when necessary to rapidly suppress a specific action, the action is inhibited along with all other potential actions. That is, such inhibition can affect the entire motor system . In an attempt to explain the effects mentioned above, several authors proposed the concept of non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) response inhibition . It is thought that these non-selective mechanisms serve to prevent inappropriate or premature responses at the expense of the speed of execution of correct actions. First, response inhibition mechanisms may non-selectively inhibit all potential responses to further selectively execute an appropriate response (non-selective inhibition of multiple concurrent motor responses). Second, inhibition may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by the occurrence of any imperative stimuli instructing on the necessity to suppress or execute a prepared action (non-selectivity of inhibitory stimulus perception). In the present work, we consider the latter mechanism. \n\nA tentative neurophysiological model of the non-selective or \u201cglobal\u201d response inhibition involved in the resolution of interference between several competing response options was proposed by Frank  and included the cortico-subthalamic \u201chyper-direct\u201d pathway  which is capable of rapidly and non-selectively suppress all potential response options. As the research area developed, it was hypothesized that the model might be applied not only to tasks with multiple concurrent response options but also to simpler tasks where the subject has to choose between executing and refraining from an action . The authors used a cued equiprobable Go/NoGo task, wherein a preparatory cue stimulus indicated the probability of a NoGo stimulus occurrence. A simple equiprobable Go/NoGo was chosen instead of a complex Go/NoGo task to limit confounds between response inhibition and the accompanying cognitive processes . Complex Go/NoGo tasks usually utilize the low probability of NoGo stimulus, difficulties in identifying NoGo signals, high attentional or working memory loads. Although one of the possible ways to build up a prepotent response tendency is to bias the Go/NoGo probabilities in favour of Go stimuli, it is not necessary when the design involves a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and reduces the complexity of the identification of Go and NoGo signals to a single bit of information . In these conditions, a stimulus that does not require a response elicits subthreshold automatic motor activations that do not become overt because they are counteracted by fast automatic response inhibition . \n\nWithin the framework of the selective inhibition model, the inhibition process would only be triggered by the identification of the NoGo stimulus. According to the hypothesis of non-selective inhibition, when the context is uncertain (equal probability of NoGo and Go stimuli), the need for response inhibition arises for both NoGo and Go trials. Experimental assessment of the hypotheses revealed no statistically significant differences between the NoGo and Go trials in both the amplitude of the early components of event-related potentials (ERP)  and the level of neuronal activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . At the same time, a significant difference in early ERP amplitudes (peaked at 170\u00a0ms) was found in uncertain equiprobable NoGo and Go trials compared to certain Go-control trials, where no inhibition is required . The authors considered this fact as evidence for the presence of a \u201cnon-selective\u201d inhibitory mechanism that is not specific to the processing of NoGo signals. The analysis of early ERP components suggests that non-selective inhibition may blindly suppress any automatic response when the context is uncertain, acting as a gating mechanism controlling the initiation of a prepared, prepotent response. \n\nHowever, a critical limitation of the above-mentioned studies was that the authors could not accept the null hypothesis, so they did not provide direct proof of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity level between Go and NoGo trials in inhibition-related brain structures. Indeed, within the framework of classical (frequentist) null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we cannot accept the null hypothesis based on the absence of a significant difference. We can only reject it. Thus, the question of experimental support for non-selective response inhibition remains unanswered, and answering this question requires overcoming the methodological limitation of NHST, which is possible using Bayesian statistics . \n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to verify the non-selective response inhibition hypothesis by using the fMRI data from an equiprobable Go/NoGo task. Based on the results of previous studies, it may be suggested that if the hypothesis on the non-selectivity of inhibition is correct, then the brain structures responsible for response inhibition will demonstrate practically equivalent levels of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials. Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was applied to assess this prediction. Instead, if the hypothesis on the selectivity of response inhibition is correct, then activation of inhibition-related brain structures will be observed in the NoGo conditions compared to the Go conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### A meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks \n  \nGiven that a practically equivalent level of neuronal activity can be identified not only for response inhibition-related structures, but also, for example, those related to sensory processing of visual stimuli, working memory, and attention, we conducted a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to independently localize brain structures associated with response inhibition. Studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks were selected for meta-analysis. We searched for studies that, similar to the investigation by Albares et al.  and Criaud et al. , compared neuronal activity in the condition of equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli with the control Go condition, in which the subject did not need to inhibit the prepared action. We hypothesized that inhibition would be non-selectively elicited by both equiprobable Go and NoGo-stimuli when the context is uncertain. To test the non-selective inhibition hypothesis, we considered similar Go/NoGo tasks with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo-stimuli. We did not consider Go/NoGo tasks with rare NoGo-stimuli, since studies using them have previously shown the involvement of selective response inhibition . \n\nWe searched for these studies in the PubMed database in the period from 01/01/2000 to 15/07/2019 using the following keywords: \u201c((fmri) OR (functional magnetic resonance)) AND ((nogo) OR (no-go)).\u201d Four additional studies were identified through manual searches. As a result, 726 papers were identified. At the first stage of selection, we excluded reviews, meta-analyses and papers repeatedly reporting the results of fMRI studies (see the flow chart of analysis in Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nFlow chart of study selection in the meta-analysis. \n  \n\nStudies dealing with Flanker task modifications of Go/NoGo task or based on unequal probability of appearance of Go and NoGo trials were also excluded from the analysis. As a result, 593 papers were excluded. The task designs of the remaining 113 papers provided for equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation. At the next step, 82 of the papers were excluded based on the following criteria: auditory and sensorimotor Go/NoGo tasks were used; only emotion-laden task conditions were used (emotionally neutral conditions were either absent or not considered separately); required Go-control condition (100% probability of the Go stimulus presentation) was not used; the coordinates for the contrast of interest \u201c50/50% Go/NoGo\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control\u201d within a group of healthy subjects were not reported. In 11 out of the 31 remaining studies, healthy volunteer subjects under the age of 18 (children and adolescents) were studied. These articles were also excluded from the analysis because this study focused on brain activity of healthy, adult subjects. In all remaining studies except one, only block designs were used. To make our sample more homogeneous, we excluded the only eligible study with an event-related design . The final meta-analysis included 20 studies (452 healthy subjects, mean age 29\u00a0years) with a total of 210 foci (for more details, see the \u201c \u201d, Table  ). All coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Lancaster transform . The number of studies included in the current meta-analysis meets the minimum recommended number of 17\u201320 studies . \n\nCoordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) was performed using the random-effects activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm  implemented in the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ) and Seed-based   d   Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) algorithm  implemented in the SDM-PSI 6.22 software ( ). Two different CBMA algorithms were used for the cross-method validation. \n\nThe ALE algorithm assesses the spatial convergence between neuroimaging studies by modelling spatial uncertainty of activation foci using isotropic three-dimensional Gaussian probability functions with the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) inversely related to the square root of the sample size of the original study . An ALE map is obtained by computing the union of activation probabilities across studies for each voxel and tested against a null distribution of random spatial convergence between studies . The empirical validations  showed that the optimal FWHM largely depends on the data and may be substantially larger than proposed in . The spatial smoothness of our fMRI data after preprocessing was 13.5\u00a0mm, as estimated by the SPM12 (Statistical parametric mapping) software package ( ). Since our objective was to find an overlap between the results of the meta-analysis and the Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data, we used an additional FWHM of 4\u00a0mm for the ALE meta-analysis. It allowed us to achieve a median kernel FWHM of 13.5\u00a0mm. We used a cluster-level extend threshold of 0.05 corrected for family-wise error (FWE) with an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold of 0.001 (5000 threshold permutations) recommended for the ALE analysis . \n\nThe alternative CBMA algorithm, SDM-PSI, considers not only the coordinates of the activation foci, but also the effect sizes. The SDM-PSI algorithm recreates 3D effect size images for each study using t-values of the peak coordinates and anisotropic kernels . It has been shown that the recreation substantially improved by fully anisotropic kernels and did not depend on the FWHM . We performed the SDM-PSI meta-analysis using the same coordinates as for the ALE meta-analysis adding peak t-values (z-values were converted to t-values). We used the default kernel (\u03b1\u2009=\u20091, FWHM\u2009=\u200920\u00a0mm) and threshold (threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 with 5000 permutations) recommended by SDM developers . \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nThe recruitment of subjects for the present fMRI study was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the sample size was 20 subjects (16 women, aged (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) 23.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6). To protect from the potential impact of relatively small sample size on the observed null-effects a retrospective power analysis was carried out, which suggested increasing the sample size up to 34 subjects. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 healthy, right-handed volunteer subjects (24 women, aged 25.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2). An Oldfield test was used to determine the dominant arm . The subject volunteers signed a written informed consent to participate in the study and were paid for their participation. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the N.P. Bechtereva Institute of the Human Brain of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n\n\n### Power analysis \n  \nTo perform power analysis, we used the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomic LA5c dataset  as it contains fMRI data from a relatively large cohort (N\u2009=\u2009115) of healthy subjects performing a stop-signal task (see \u201c \u201d for details). This classical inhibitory paradigm models a situation in which inhibitory brain activity is selectively triggered by infrequent inhibitory stimuli (stop signal) but not by Go stimuli . The mean effect sizes for the selective inhibition contrast (\u201cCorrect-Stop\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d contrast, see Fig.  ) were estimated within the cortical brain regions revealed by the current meta-analysis. They ranged from 0.57 to 1.12 Cohen\u2019s d. Power analysis was performed using GPower 3.1.9.7 . It indicated that the sample size of 34 subjects would be sufficient to detect the minimum expected selective inhibition effect (d\u2009=\u20090.57, two-tailed one-sample test, alpha\u2009=\u20090.05) with a power of 0.9 (see Fig.  ). The power of 0.8 or 0.9 is commonly used for sample size calculations . \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that obtaining non-significant results with high retrospective power (based on an independent dataset) or high prospective power would not provide direct evidence for the null hypothesis ). To provide evidence for the null hypothesis, Bayesian inference or frequentist equivalence testing should be used . Accordingly, in the current study, all conclusions on the non-selective response inhibition were made only on the basis of the Bayesian analysis and its overlap with the meta-analysis. Results for the classical NHST were added only to illustrate how the more familiar frequentist inference relates to Bayesian inference. \n\n\n### Experimental task and study procedure \n  \nWe used a paired stimulus modification of the Go/NoGo task (see Fig.\u00a0 ) . This task was originally developed to dissociate cognitive processes, such as response inhibition, conflict monitoring, sensory mismatch and category discrimination . Given that imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented in an equiprobable manner this modification of the Go/NoGo task was used for the purposes of the current study. Each trial consisted of the two consequently presented stimuli. The first preparatory cue stimulus warned the subjects on the presentation of the second, imperative stimulus, or indicated no need for any response to the second stimulus. The study included two variants of the experiment\u2019s instructions. According to the first instruction (see Fig.\u00a0 A), the subject should press the response button as soon as possible upon presentation of the pair of images \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A Go\u201d trials) and refrain from acting upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d trials). According to the instructions of the second experiment (see Fig.\u00a0 B), the subject acts after presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P Go\u201d trials) and suppresses an action upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d trials). The subjects were familiarized with the task just before scanning to ensure they understood the instructions. Additionally, before each fMRI session, the subjects were reminded of the need to react to Go stimuli as quickly as possible while refraining from reacting to NoGo stimuli.   \nExperimental design of the Go/NoGo task. S1\u2014first stimulus (preparatory cue). S2\u2014second stimulus (imperative stimulus). A\u2014images of animals, P\u2014images of plants. (  A  ) First experiment: \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d. (  B  ) Second experiment: \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d. Red boxes highlight trials that were compared to test the hypothesis of selective and non-selective response inhibition. \n  \n\nIn both experiments, if the first stimulus presented was an image of a \u201cplant,\u201d subjects do not need to take any actions in response to the presentation of any second stimuli of a trial. In such a trial, the subject should ignore the second stimulus and wait for the next pair of stimuli (\u201cP-A Ignore\u201d and \u201cP-P Ignore\u201d trials). Accordingly, it was assumed that there is no inhibition of the prepared action in \u201cIgnore\u201d conditions. The \u201cIgnore\u201d trials were included in the adopted Go/NoGo task to assess preparatory brain activity, such as preparing to receive a relevant stimulus (attentional set) and preparing to make a movement (motor set), by comparing them to Go and NoGo trials. However, the issue related to the preparatory processes is beyond the scope of the present study. Fifty pairs of each type of stimuli were randomly presented in each experiment. The order of following the instructions was counterbalanced among the subjects. Two variants of the present Go/NoGo task allowed us to control the differences in the load on working memory between A-P/A-A\u2013Go/NoGo stimuli . \n\nThe fMRI data obtained using this experimental task allowed us to test the hypothesis on the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition in the current study, since a similar task design was previously used for the same purpose by Criaud et al. . The imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented after the preparatory stimulus with equal probability, as reported in event-related studies by . To build up prepotent tendency to react, subjects were instructed to press the button with their right thumb as quickly as possible. This is a case of a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and only one bit of information. It is known that these conditions elicit subthreshold automatic motor activations . According to G.A. Miller: \u201cOne bit of information is the amount of information that we need to make a decision between two equally likely alternatives\u201d . Here, it refers to discrimination between \u201canimal\u201d and \u201cplant\u201d stimuli. \n\nSuch an equally probable presentation of imperative stimuli provides several advantages. First, it minimizes the difference in cognitive load between Go and NoGo conditions arising from task complexity . Second, such a design enables the exclusion of effects associated with a low frequency of the NoGo stimuli presentation (\u201coddball\u201d effects) confounding the effect of inhibition . Third, it creates maximum uncertainty regarding the probability of the presentation of an imperative stimulus, thus minimizes the conflict between two response types, making it possible to distinguish between error monitoring and conflict resolution processes on the one hand and response inhibition processes on the other . \n\nIn total, 100 NoGo trials, 100 Go trials, 100 P-A Ignore trials, and 100 P-P Ignore trials were presented over two experimental sessions. In the absence of stimulation, a fixation cross was displayed in the centre of the screen. The stimuli were presented for 100\u00a0ms, and the interstimulus interval was 1000\u00a0ms. The intertrial interval jittered from 2800 to 3200\u00a0ms with an increment step of 100\u00a0ms. Additionally, to improve design efficiency, 100 zero events (fixation crosses) were randomly inserted between the stimuli pairs (trials), and their duration jittered from 3000 to 5000\u00a0ms with an increment size of 500\u00a0ms. The action to be performed consisted of pressing a button with the right thumb. The duration of one task session was 17.5\u00a0min. Before starting the fMRI study, the subjects performed a training task. The Invivo\u2019s Eloquence fMRI System (Invivo, Orlando, FL, USA) was used to deliver the stimuli, synchronize with fMRI acquisition, and record reaction times of subjects\u2019 bottom pressing. The task presentation sequence and all temporal parameters of the stimuli presentation were programmed using the E-prime 2.0 software package (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) was used for the study. The structural T1-images were registered with the following parameters: field of view (FOV)\u2014240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm, repetition time (TR)\u201425\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u20142.2\u00a0ms, 130 axial slices with a thickness of 1\u00a0mm and pixel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201430\u00b0. For the registration of T2*-images, a single-pulse echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used. The period of data registration from 31 axial slices was 2\u00a0s (TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200935\u00a0ms). The following parameters were employed: FOV\u2014200\u2009\u00d7\u2009186\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201490\u00b0, voxel size\u20143\u2009\u00d7\u20093x3 mm. Two dummy scans were performed prior to each session. To minimize head movements, we used an MR-compatible soft cervical collar and foam padding. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of fMRI images \n  \nImage preprocessing included the following: realignment to the first image of the session, slice time correction, co-registration, segmentation, normalization to an MNI template, and spatial smoothing (8\u00a0mm FWHM). Preprocessing and statistical analyses of the images were performed using an SPM12. To assess head motion during the scanning, we calculated the framewise displacement (FD) as the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the six realignment parameters . The mean FD across two runs ranged from 0.07 to 0.36\u00a0mm (group mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation was 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0mm). The average percentage of time points with FD over 0.9\u00a0mm was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092%. We used all time points for the analysis since all subjects had >\u200990% volumes under the FD threshold of 0.9\u00a0mm . \n\n\n### Lateralized BOLD response analysis \n  \nOne of the electrophysiological indicators of overt and covert motor activations is the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) . The equiprobable Go/NoGo study by Hong et al.  showed an increase of the right-hand target-related LRP (\u201cC3 minus C4\u201d ERP difference) in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, which was considered as evidence of a prepotent response tendency. The fMRI analogue of LRP is the Lateralized BOLD response (LBR) . Therefore, we used the LBR to index prepotent motor activations under task settings of the present study. The right-hand LBR was calculated as the mean BOLD signal in the left sensorimotor cortex (SM) minus the right SM cortex (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference). BOLD signal was estimated within 0.5\u00a0s time bins from the target onset time using finite impulse response models (time window from 1 to 12\u00a0s). Regions of interest (ROIs) located in the SM cortex were defined as the overlap between anatomical and a priori functional masks . Functional masks were obtained using the Neurosynth platform for an automatic meta-analysis ( ). We used a uniformity test with a default false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p\u2009<\u20090.01 threshold for the \u201cmotor\u201d term (2565 studies). To obtain anatomical masks, we used voxels with the maximum probability for \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d and \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d labels according to the probabilistic Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas . ROI analysis was performed using one-sample and paired-sample t-tests with FDR correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of fMRI data \n  \nThe first level of analysis was conducted using frequentist parameter estimation. The second level of analysis was performed using both the frequentist and Bayesian parameter estimation . In general, using Bayesian analysis on the second level does not presuppose Bayesian parameter estimation at the first level of analysis. One can combine computationally less demanding frequentist parameter estimation for single subjects with Bayesian estimation and inference at the group level . Onset times of second stimuli presentation (separately for \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d, and also \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d), erroneous button pressing, and missing the responding in Go trials were used to create regressors of the general linear model (GLM) for each subject. Events were impulse responses with a duration of zero convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF). We also performed an additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives for all task regressors to take into account the unknown BOLD delay. Low-frequency drift was removed by temporal high-pass filtering with a cut-off frequency of 1/128\u00a0Hz. Six head motion parameters were included in the GLM as nuisance regressors to account for the movement artefacts . Beta coefficients reflecting an increase in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the experimental condition relative to the implicit baseline were scaled to percent signal change (PSC) following the procedure recommended in [Ref. , p.186]. To this end, the beta coefficients for each condition were divided by the mean value of the beta coefficients for the constant term and multiplied by 100 and a scaling factor (SF) needed so that the peak of an isolated BOLD response is equal to one (SF\u2009=\u20090.21). Two linear contrasts of scaled beta coefficients were calculated: (1) 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d]\u20140.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]   (the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison);   (2) 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]\u20140.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d]   (the \u201cGo  \u2009+\u2009  NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison).   The sum of positive contrast weights was equal to one. The contrasts from 34 subjects were used as variables to verify the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition at the second level of analysis. Only grey matter voxels were included in the second-level analysis, as we did not expect to detect the BOLD signal changes in white matter associated with the Go/NoGo task performance. To that end, a mask was created based on the segmentation of each subject\u2019s structural T1-images. \n\n\n### Verification of the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition \n  \nAs in previous studies employing equiprobable Go/NoGo task with a single prepotent motor response, in the current study, non-selectivity refers to the perceptual decision mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination, or identification of sensory stimuli . In particular, we did not consider non-selectivity related to decision mechanisms that involve the selection between multiple alternative responses, which confound response inhibition processes in choice reaction time tasks . The former type of non-selectivity implies that any imperative stimuli (both Go and NoGo stimuli) would trigger response inhibition when the context is uncertain because of equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. The latter type of non-selectivity, usually called \u201cglobal\u201d inhibition, implies that inhibition affects all alternative responses, including the selected response . \n\nWe tested the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition using the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. In the case of the   selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a selective increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of NoGo stimuli compared to Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d). In the case of the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a practically equivalent increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of both NoGo and Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) in the brain areas related to the response inhibition, which were independently localized by the current meta-analysis (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d). Additionally, we used the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison to distinguish between the brain areas that are simply not activated in current task settings (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009=\u2009Ignore\u201d) from the brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, where no inhibition is required (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). Thus, to identify the non-selective response inhibition in the settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli, it was necessary to show a three-way overlap between (1) inhibitory-related brain areas according to the meta-analysis (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d), (2) brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) and (3) brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). This conjunction analysis was performed by binarization and multiplication of thresholded images . \n\nTo reveal brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d), one has to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. The classical NHST approach estimates the probability (p-value) of obtaining actual data\u2019s best-fitting parameter value,   \u03b2  , or something more extreme under the null hypothesis that the experimental effect is   \u03b8  \u2009=\u2009  c\u03b2  \u2009=\u2009  0.   The null hypothesis can never be accepted using NHST because the p-value does not represent the probability of the null hypothesis, and the probability that an effect equals exactly zero is itself zero . A non-significant result can be obtained in two cases : (1) there is no effect, and our data are against the alternative hypothesis; or (2) our data are insufficient to distinguish alternative hypothesis from the null hypothesis, and we cannot confidently make any inference (low statistical power). When the result obtained is not significant, it is recommended to use frequentist equivalence testing  or Bayesian inference  to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. In the present study, Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was used . \n\nThe Bayesian approach estimates the posterior probability   (PP)   distribution of the effect   \u03b8  , given the data using the likelihood and the prior knowledge. For the second-level Bayesian analysis, SPM12 implements the hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes approach with the global shrinkage prior . It represents a prior belief that, on average, in the whole brain, there is no global experimental effect. If the posterior probability of the effect exceeding the effect size threshold,   \u03b3,   is greater than the predefined probability threshold,   \u03b1  \u2009=\u200995%, then the hypothesis on the presence of \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted (see Fig.  A in the \u201c \u201d): \n\nIf the effect value falls within the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with a probability of   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.95, then the hypothesis of the null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted, supporting the practical equivalence  of the BOLD signal between the conditions compared (see Fig.  B): \n\nThe interval [\u2212\u2009  y  ;   y  ] can be thought of as the neuronal \u201cbackground noise level\u201d  or as a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) that expresses which effect size values (PSC) are equivalent to the null value for current practical purposes . \n\nThe hypothesis on the presence of the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect will be accepted if (see Fig.  C): \n\nIf none of the above criteria are satisfied, the data in particular voxel are insufficient to distinguish the null hypothesis from the alternative hypothesis (\u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, see Fig.  D) . For such voxels, it is impossible to make any inference confidently, so we need to increase the sample size or scanning time. In the current study, our conclusions were based only on voxels in which the effect size values (PSC) fell within or outside the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with the   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Thus, for these voxels, the data obtained are sufficient to make an inference confidently. This decision rule is also known as the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule [ ; see Fig.  ]. It was applied to the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparisons. BPI was performed using the   BayInf   toolbox based on SPM12 ( ) . BPI based on the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule with a zero-effect size threshold corresponds to the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons within the NHST framework . The group-level effect size threshold   \u03b3   was set at one standard deviation of the prior variance of the contrast (prior SD ), which is the default in SPM12 . Simulations showed that this threshold provides high sensitivity to both \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnot activated\u201d voxels while protecting against incorrect decisions . BPI with the ES threshold of one prior SD  typically detect similar \u201cactivations\u201d as classical NHST inference with a voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 . To illustrate this, the BPI results were compared with the classical NHST results. For visualization purposes, the posterior probabilities were converted to the logarithmic posterior odds, LogOdds\u2009=\u2009log(  PP  /(1\u2009\u2212\u2009  PP  )). LogOdds\u2009>\u20093 correspond to   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Anatomical localization of clusters was identified using xjView toolbox ( ). \n\n\n### Sequential analyses \n  \nSince the statistical analysis was carried out twice, for the sample size N\u2009=\u200920 and N\u2009=\u200934, the question of \u201cdata peeking\u201d should be addressed. \u201cData peeking\u201d refers to the practice when a researcher periodically re-analyses sequentially obtained data and decides to stop data collection as soon as significant results are obtained . Sequential analyses and optional stopping in the classical NHST framework substantially inflate the number of false positives and require special adjustments of the p-values along with the definition of the stopping rule based on the power analysis . In contrast, Bayesian inference based on the posterior probabilities or Bayes factors does not depend on stopping intentions and does not necessarily require power analysis . Therefore, the issue of \u201cdata peeking\u201d may be mitigated by the usage of Bayesian statistics . \n\nWithin the classical NHST framework, a statistically significant difference may be shown in any voxel with a sufficiently large sample size, even when the effect is trivial or has no practical significance . Thus, with an unbounded increase of the data, the number of statistically significant voxels will approach 100% of the total number of voxels [see, for example ]. At the same time, Bayesian inference allows one to find not only \u201cactivated\u201d voxels but also \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels with a trivial difference (practical equivalence) and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for which obtained data are not sufficient. Increasing sample size using BPI will lead to the situation when the number of \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels reaches a plateau. When the plateau was reached, it is reasonable to stop the data collection. To illustrate how this relates to the current study, we provide an analysis of the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cactivated\u201d, \u201cnull effect,\u201d and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. To plot these dependencies, the analysis was performed for the samples from 6 to 34 subjects with a step of 2 subjects (see the \u201c \u201d). In total thirty random groups were sampled for each step. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \nAs a result of the ALE meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, we identified the brain structures that were characterized by increased neuronal activity demonstrated in settings of equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation compared to the control Go conditions (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks >\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast): (1) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), (2) right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), (4) bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula (also known as anterior insula/frontal operculum (AIFO)), (5) right premotor cortex (PMC) and frontal eye field (FEF), (6) bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), and (7) bilateral thalamus (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The SDM-PSI results were generally consistent with the ALE results, with the only difference being the absence of clusters in the subcortex (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Therefore, below, we consider only clusters in the cerebral cortex.   \nResults of the ALE meta-analysis.

No significant increases were revealed using a less conservative threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 and a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of 0.005. Additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives also did not reveal a significant \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect predicted by the hypothesis of selective response inhibition. \n\nThe reversed \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast showed the expected motor activations in the pre- and postcentral gyrus, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, subcortical regions and cerebellum (see Fig.\u00a0  and Tables  , Tables   in the \u201c \u201d). Both statistical methods revealed similar activation patterns for the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.8), demonstrating the consistency between the BPI with   \u03b3  \u2009=\u20091 prior SD  and LogOdds\u2009>\u20093   (PP  \u2009>\u20090.95) thresholding approach and NHST with the voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05.   \nResults of classical voxel-wise and Bayesian parameter inference.

White colour depicts (  A  ) non-significant voxels and (  B  ) \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels. Figure was created using Mango 4.1 software ( ). \n  \n\nAt the same time, Bayesian analysis has made it possible to define brain structures with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials. The null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect was revealed for a widely distributed set of regions throughout the entire brain surrounding clusters of activations revealed in the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast (see Fig.\u00a0 A). The \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d regions were separated from activation clusters by regions that consisted of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels . For \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, the data obtained are insufficient to accept or reject the null hypothesis. The number of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels were decreased with increasing sample size (see Fig.   in the \u201c \u201d). The largest gain in the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels can be noted from 6 to 20 subjects. After 20 subjects, the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels reached a plateau. This is also confirmed by the similarity between the BPI results for the sample size of 20 and 34 subjects (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.88 for the \"NoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\" effect, see also Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). \n\nIt should be noted that the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area cannot be reasonably split into several parts, such as activation clusters. Therefore, we limited ourselves to specifying the anatomic localization of brain areas where the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area overlaps with the clusters revealed by the current meta-analysis and brain areas activated by equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (see \u201c \u201d for the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d contrast in the \u201c \u201d, Fig.   and Table  ). \n\n\n### LBR analysis \n  \nThe right-hand LBRs were analysed to assess the prepotent motor tendency in equiprobable Go/NoGo task settings. We did not find a significant increase in LBR above zero for the Ignore condition in any of the analysed time bins (see Table   in the \u201c \u201d). At the same time, we found a significant increase in LBR in the NoGo trials compared to the Ignore trials for time bins from 2.5 to 5.5\u00a0s (pFDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Therefore, the revealed increase in LBR supports the presence of prepotent motor activity in the NoGo trials (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nLBRs for the right hand (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference).

Three-way overlap was observed in (1) right DLPFC, (2) right IPL, (3) right TPJ, (4) left IFG and anterior insula (AIFO), (5) right PMC, and FEF (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The results of the three-way overlap obtained using the SDM-PSI meta-analysis were generally consistent with the ALE overlap (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Two additional clusters were revealed using SDM-PSI meta-analysis: (1) left ACC/preSMA (BA 32) and (2) right anterior insula. In the discussion, we considered only those clusters that were found in three-way overlaps for both meta-analyses.   \nThree-way overlap between the ALE meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis.

Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data provides evidence of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity evoked by Go and NoGo stimuli in several brain structures. According to the results of our meta-analysis, some of these brain structures, including the right DLPFC, IPL, and TPJ, the left IFG (AIFO), the right PMC, and FEF were associated with response inhibition. These structures were repeatedly found to be activated whenever the condition of equal probability presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli was compared with the control Go condition (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). At the same time, we did not observe the selective response inhibition effect (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d) in the current study. This finding is consistent with the data of several previous event-related fMRI studies that did not find significant activity increase in NoGo trials compared to Go trials under similar experimental conditions , see also random-effects analysis within visual and audio modalities in . \n\nAn important question is whether we did not able to observe selective response inhibition due to insufficient inhibitory load in our task setting. Previously, it was argued that some configurations of the Go/NoGo task may not reliably evoke prepotent motor activity and therefore their inhibition requirements are reduced . The argument for this was supported by fronto-central P300 amplitude reduction observed in the slow-paced (i.e. stimulus-stimulus interval\u2009>\u20094\u00a0s) equiprobable Go/NoGo settings compared to settings with fast-paced rare NoGo trials. However, the study by Wessel  did not consider the cue-target type paradigms, aimed to increase the likelihood of a prepotent motor response, as in the current study. Equiprobable cue-target Go/NoGo tasks have previously been successfully used to study prepotent response inhibition . Moreover, the Wessel study  considered fronto-central P300 as an index of inhibition of prepotent motor activity. However, some studies have suggested that the P300 component (and also the N200 component) is too late to explain the inhibition processes . It was argued that a marker of inhibitory control should exhibit activity that precedes inhibitory effects at the level of the motor cortex or the effector muscles (about 150\u00a0ms after inhibitory stimuli presentation, see . \n\nArguments on fast early inhibition were considered in a recent review by Diesburg and Wessel  developing the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model of motor inhibition in humans. This model was originally proposed by Schmidt and Berke  based on subcortical rodent recordings. It assumes that inhibition of motor responses is a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, any unexpected stimuli non-selectively and briefly delay or \u201cPause\u201d actions. The \u201cPause\u201d process has a global inhibitory effect on the motor system via the monosynaptic \u201chyperdirect\u201d pathway from the cortex to the subthalamic nucleus and is similar to the \u201cglobal inhibition\u201d concept proposed by Frank . In the second stage, if an unexpected stimulus is discriminated as inhibitory, a relatively slower inhibitory process fully \u201cCancels\u201d action via the \u201cindirect\u201d pathway. Therefore, the \u201cPause\u201d process \u201cbuys time\u201d for stimulus discrimination and decision making. According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model, the early transient suppression of corticospinal excitability and subthreshold EMG may be a reflection of the \u201cPause\u201d process. Although Diesburg and Wessel  have mainly focused on the stop-signal tasks, they also argued that their theoretical framework applies to motor inhibition in other paradigms, including the Go/NoGo tasks. The authors posit that the \u201cPause\u201d process is part of a universal orienting response common to all salient, task-relevant events. This is in line with the hypothesis of the current study. When the context is uncertain because of the equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli, any imperative Go or NoGo stimuli may non-selectively trigger the inhibitory process. Conceptually this is similar to the \u201cPause\u201d process. \n\nThe presence of the prepotent response tendency in the current study was supported both by fast response times (\u2053\u2009380\u00a0ms) and increased LBR in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (fee Fig.\u00a0 ), in which no prepotent motor activity was expected. The former finding is closely match behavioural data from previous studies with similar equiprobable Go/NoGo design, where subjects were trained to react as fast as possible to create prepotent response tendency . The later experimentally demonstrates the presence of covert prepotent motor activity in NoGo trials. \n\nThe other important question is how precisely observed activity can be associated with response inhibition per se in those brain regions in which the overlap was found between the meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis. It is well known that the frontoparietal structures (DLPFC, IPL, TPJ) are engaged not only in Go/NoGo tasks but also in experiments examining task switching, resolution of cognitive conflicts, working memory, and attention focusing (\u201cmultiple demand system\u201d ; \u201ctask-general network\u201d ; \u201cextrinsic mode network\u201d . According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model the non-selective inhibitory process (\u201cPause\u201d) and attentional process may be indistinguishable, because attentional orienting to salient, task-related signals inherently accompanied by broad motor suppression . Both processes are so fast and transient that their neural signatures may be near impossible to disentangle. Furthermore, attentional and inhibitory processes may rely on overlapping neural circuits. \n\nHowever, several attempts have been made to dissociate inhibitory and attentional processes by using special modifications of Go/NoGo task that control for attentional loads. For example, the fMRI study by Chikazoe et al.  showed greater activation to infrequent NoGo-stimuli than to infrequent Go-stimuli in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG). Since both NoGo and Go stimuli were infrequent, the authors associated pIFG activation with an inhibitory process. They also demonstrated attention-related activity in the right inferior frontal junction (anatomically close to pIFG) using infrequent Go stimuli vs. frequent Go stimuli contrast. The other fMRI study by Dodds et al.  showed activation in the right IFG to NoGo trials without attentional shifting compared to Go trials with attentional shifting. Reverse contrast revealed activation in the left inferior parietal cortex. The authors suggested that the right IFG and the left inferior parietal cortex are preferentially activated during response inhibition and attentional shifting, respectively. Dissimilar results have been observed in the fMRI study by Meffert et al. , which varied the frequency of Go and NoGo stimuli. They showed that the   left   IFG and dorsal pre-SMA were responsive to NoGo stimuli regardless of stimuli frequency. Meanwhile, a more ventral portion of pre-SMA and anterior insula showed greater activity to low frequency relative to higher frequency stimuli, regardless of response type. Finally, in the EEG studies by Hong et al.  and Hong et al.  the attention-related neural activity (P300 ERP and theta oscillations in the cingulate cortex) was dissociated from inhibitory-related activity by comparing between attended-NoGo and ignored-NoGo conditions. \n\nAt the same time, the most prominent feature of brain activity during Go/NoGo tasks compared to diverse non-inhibitory tasks is a right-dominant activity in DLPFC [meta-analyses: ]. Among different response inhibition tasks, several meta-analyses showed that an action-restraint (Go/NoGo task) elicits stronger activation in the right DLPFC and parietal cortex compared to another inhibition process, namely, action cancellation (stop-signal task) . Furthermore, the \u201cresponse uncertainty\u201d tasks induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli evoked more activity in the right DLPFC (near the cluster revealed in the current study with coordinates [x\u2009=\u200945 y\u2009=\u200933 z\u2009=\u200928], see Table  ) compared to Go/NoGo and stop-signal tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli (\u201cresponse override\u201d tasks) . \n\nIn meta-analyses by Simmonds et al.  and Criaud and Boulinguez , it was supposed that the increased activity in the right DLPFC observed during Go/NoGo tasks may be due to increased demands caused by working memory and attentional load rather than the inhibition processes per se. The authors explained this by the fact that most of the fMRI studies used complex designs. Therefore, it would be relatively more difficult to identify a NoGo stimulus, which is believed to increase the need for inhibitory control and consequently increase the brain inhibitory activity in NoGo trials. However, this confounding effect was controlled in the current fMRI study because we utilized a simple equiprobable Go/NoGo task. \n\nAnother prefrontal structure related to the non-selective response inhibition in the current study was the left IFG (opercular part, AIFO). At the same time, the right IFG is commonly associated with response inhibition . Based on the study of patients with brain damage  and other neuroimaging studies using primarily the stop-signal tasks , it was claimed that the right IFG represents a key node of the response inhibition brain system. Currently, this opinion is under active discussion . It is noted that Aron et al.  predominantly relied upon studies using the stop-signal task and did not consider studies using Go/NoGo tasks . Other studies revealed worse performance in the Go/NoGo task when the left (not right) IFG was damaged . According to these findings, the left IFG can also participate in inhibitory control during action restraint, which is also confirmed by our results. \n\nRegarding the practically equivalent participation of PMC in both the Go and NoGo trials, it was previously shown to participate in the planning and coordination of actions because its electrical stimulation results in involuntary motor actions . According to Duque et al. , premotor cortex function is associated with inhibition of any premature actions and control of the time of action execution. The authors refer to this brain mechanism as \u201cimpulse control\u201d, a concept that is similar to the non-selective response inhibition . \n\nIn summary, it can be noted that the selectivity of response inhibition has been studied more extensively to date than its non-selectivity. A considerable amount of research on inhibitory control has used tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli. However, over time, it has become apparent that under several conditions, non-selectivity of response inhibition can, in principle, occur. Studies on non-selectivity of response inhibition typically focus on the possible brain mechanisms for non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) inhibition of motor responses in the settings of interference among multiple concurrent response options . Recently, Criaud et al.  supposed the possibility of involvement of non-selective response inhibition not only for NoGo stimuli but also for Go stimuli. In the current study, the practical equivalence of BOLD signals evoked by equiprobable NoGo and Go stimuli was demonstrated for a number of brain areas associated with response inhibition in an uncertain context, according to our meta-analysis. The present study results proved that response inhibition can act as a non-selective mechanism of action inhibition when the context is uncertain. Thus, one promising area of further research of brain mechanisms of response inhibition (and inhibitory control in general) is the study of the interplay between selective and non-selective inhibition as a function of the contextual uncertainty degree. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFor the first time, combining a meta-analysis and second-level Bayesian analysis yielded results favouring the existence of non-selective response inhibition in equiprobable Go/NoGo task settings. In the present work, selectivity means that inhibition is triggered only by an inhibitory stimulus. The overlap between brain areas previously associated with response inhibition in uncertain context and brain areas demonstrating the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials was observed in the right DLPFC, IPL, TPJ, FEF, PMC, and left IFG (AIFO). When a subject was waiting for an equiprobable Go or NoGo stimulus, a non-selective inhibitory control process occurred in both Go trials and NoGo trials in opposition to the model of selective response inhibition. This type of response inhibition prevents the performance of any premature motor actions and operates in a non-selective, \u201cglobal\u201d mode. Its involvement is favoured by contextual uncertainty caused by the equally probable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. Presumably, upon the identification of a Go stimulus, the inhibition is released and the process of action execution is initiated, i.e., it acts as a gating mechanism for accessing a prepared motor program. At the same time, we do not discard the opportunity of involvement of selective inhibitory mechanisms in a less uncertain context. Therefore, future research should address the issue of how brain mechanisms of selective and non-selective response inhibition are inter-related. \n\n### Limitations and further considerations \n  \nGenerally, it is assumed that the non-selective response inhibition is a relatively early transient process. Therefore, one of the limitations is associated with a low temporal resolution of the fMRI method. Further studies of the early temporal dynamics of neural activity are needed using EEG, MEG, and intracranial recordings in similar uncertain context settings. In particular, evidence for the practical equivalence of early ERP amplitudes (170\u00a0ms) revealed previously in equiprobable NoGo and Go trials should be provided in a future research. It is also important to note that we looked for practically equivalent increases in regional brain activity as measured by BOLD-signal. Firstly, it is possible to look for the similarity of local activity patterns by employing multivariate classification techniques in future studies. Secondly, future research should consider how non-selective response inhibition is mediated by interactions between the revealed cortical structures and subcortical structures that form inhibitory and excitatory cortico-striato-thalamo cortical circuits. \n\nDespite the fact that revealed fast reaction times and the LBR increase in NoGo trials evidenced the existence of prepotent response tendency, the low error rate might be a potential limitation of the current study because of the high automaticity of induced behaviour. At the same time, such low commission error rates have been repeatedly reported in several equiprobable Go/NoGo studies . Future research should use objective electrophysiological measures, such as LRPs, subthreshold electromyographic activity, and motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation to rigorously demonstrate prepotent motor activity in equiprobable cue-target Go/NoGo task settings. \n\nThe other important challenge for the current study and the field in general is the question of segregation of the brain activity elicited by non-selective response inhibition from that elicited by non-inhibitory processes, like attentional or executive processes. One possible solution may be to look for brain activity that is causally related to inhibitory effects at the level of the primary motor cortex, spinal cord, and effector muscles. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 9203582, "text_md5": "a525b7315c80fa7d96613f228ae28709", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 248], "keywords": [262, 299], "abstract": [312, 2227], "body": [2236, 62192]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35710930, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-14221-x", "pmcid": "9203582", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203582", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9203582"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203582\">9203582</a>", "list_title": "PMC9203582  Evidence for non-selective response inhibition in uncertain contexts revealed by combined meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis of fMRI data"}

Beyond the core brain areas typically activated in pain empathy studies (insular and anterior cingulate cortices), the diversity of paradigms used may reveal secondary networks that subserve other more specific processes. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on pain empathy was conducted to obtain activation likelihood estimates along three factors and seven conditions: visual cues (body parts, facial expressions), visuospatial (first-person, thirdperson), and cognitive (self-, stimuli-, other-oriented tasks) perspectives. The core network was found across cues and perspectives, and common activation was observed in higher-order visual areas. Body-parts distinctly activated areas related with sensorimotor processing (superior and inferior parietal lobules, anterior insula) while facial expression distinctly involved the inferior frontal gyrus. Self- compared to other-perspective produced distinct activations in the left insula while stimulus- versus other-perspective produced distinctive responses in the inferior frontal and parietal lobules, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum. Pain empathy relies on a core network which is modulated by several secondary networks. The involvement of the latter seems to depend on the visual cues available and the observer's mental state that can be influenced by specific instructions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmpathy is a multidimensional construct supported by distinct yet interacting neural networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Researchers generally agree that empathy emerges from two major interacting components: an affective component and a cognitive component. The affective component of empathy, also labeled affective resonance ( ), affective empathy ( ;  ), experience sharing ( ) or affective sharing ( ), can be broadly defined as vicariously experiencing other peoples\u2019 sensorimotor states and emotions. The cognitive component of empathy, also known as cognitive empathy ( ), perspective taking ( ), self/other distinction ( ) or mentalizing ( ), refers to the perspective of another person while maintaining a distinction between one\u2019s own emotional state and that of the other. Thus, empathy is proposed by many to stem from the combined effect of these components and relies on various regulation mechanisms ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe neural correlates of empathy have been explored through a variety of functional neuroimaging paradigms in the last 15\u00a0years. The findings of this growing literature generally support the dichotomy between the affective and cognitive components of empathy (e.g.  ;  ). On the one hand, tasks that aim to selectively engage the affective component of empathy are associated with several brain structures including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, temporal pole, precentral gyrus (PreCG; i.e. primary motor cortex) and postcentral gyrus [PosCG; i.e. the primary and secondary somatosensory (SS) cortices; see Figure 5 in  ]. These brain structures are also associated with attentional, emotional, motivational and sensorimotor processes ( ;  ;  ). On the other hand, tasks that rely more on the cognitive component of empathy engage brain structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and fusiform gyrus (see Figure 5 in  ). These structures are also associated with executive control, action representation, working memory and visuospatial processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally, tasks that engage the affective and the cognitive components of empathy have been associated with a common set of brain regions including the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), supplementary motor area (SMA), cingulate motor area, anterior insula (AI) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; see Figure 5 in  ). This suggests that there might be a core network that is recruited across different empathy tasks. Additionally, differences in tasks used to probe empathy that can stem from differences of instructions or stimuli can also be associated with distinct and secondary networks ( ;  ;  ). The latter could be coherent with the fact that tasks tap differently in the affective or cognitive component of empathy. \n\nParadigms illustrating other\u2019s pain (also termed vicarious pain, or more commonly referred to as pain empathy paradigms) are the most common method employed to examine neural networks underpinning empathy (for a discussion on the potential overinterpretation of the term empathy in such contexts, see  ). Typically, participants view static or dynamic visual stimuli of the limbs submitted to noxious stimulation (SS pain paradigms) or facial expressions of pain [emotional-communicative (EC) pain paradigms]. These various sensory and emotional visual stimuli may contribute to the differences found in the reported brain response across studies. For instance,   showed that viewing facial expressions of pain, compared to the limbs submitted to noxious stimulation, triggered more activity in the midline frontal and parietal and amygdala, while the opposite contrast yielded more activity in sensorimotor regions. A recent meta-analysis ( ) confirmed that EC pain paradigms are related to structures in the frontal [i.e. IFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and PreCG], temporal [i.e. middle temporal gyrus (MTG), STG and fusiform gyrus] and occipital [i.e. inferior (IOG) and middle occipital gyrus (MOG)] lobes, in addition to subcortical and limbic structures such as the thalamus, putamen, AI, amygdala and the anterior cingulate. Another factor that varies in the use of stimuli across SS pain paradigms is the visuospatial orientation that is either from one\u2019s own (first-person) or from a protagonist\u2019s (third-person) perspective. First-person perspective (1PP), compared to third-person perspective (3PP), is related to higher and faster subjective evaluations of the other\u2019s pain and an increased modulation of brain activity in structures related to the affective component of empathy ( ;  ). Finally, different types of instructions with regard to the cognitive perspective to adopt when viewing the stimuli are used across pain empathy paradigms. Indeed, participants are usually instructed to adopt either a self-perspective (i.e. to feel a person\u2019s pain as if it was their own pain) or the other\u2019s perspective (i.e. to imagine or to evaluate a person\u2019s pain), or to focus on the stimulus without specific instruction about the perspective (i.e. to pay attention to the stimulus). For instance,   showed that adopting a self-perspective is associated with higher pain ratings and involves more brain activity associated with the affective component of empathy [i.e. the secondary SS cortex (SII), ACC and insula], whereas taking the other\u2019s perspective yielded specific increases in activation of structures related to the cognitive component of empathy (i.e. the PCC, precuneus and TPJ). \n\nDifferences in methodological choices (i.e. visual cues, visuospatial perspective, perspective-taking instructions) can influence the way the dimensions of empathy are solicited in participants and explain part of the variability across studies. However, very few studies have contrasted these conditions directly (e.g.  ;  ), and no study has previously tested all of these differences in methodology within the same study. Failure to contextualize results within such methodological variations can pave the way for misleading conclusions about between-study divergence ( ) or oversimplified interpretations of empathy processes ( ). It thus remains difficult to draw an integrative view of how visual cues, visuospatial perspective and perspective taking influence the brain response during pain empathy. Previous meta-analyses partly addressed this issue ( ;  ). For instance,   conducted an image-based meta-analysis that compared SS pain paradigms to abstract-cue paradigms (i.e. abstract symbols indicating that another person is receiving a noxious stimulus). Since this 2011 meta-analysis, the number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations on pain empathy has exploded, reaching more than 200 studies. Paradigms have consequently varied greatly in terms of visual stimuli and instructions used to solicit empathy. In a recent meta-analysis,   examined differences between paradigms using either stimuli of facial expressions of pain or noxious stimulations applied to a body limb and differences between paradigms that oriented the participant\u2019s perspective either toward the self (labeled perceptual/affective paradigms) or the other (labeled cognitive/evaluative paradigms). However, other methodological differences, such as visuospatial perspective, have not been addressed. In addition, results indicated that SS compared to EC pain paradigms were related distinctively to the bilateral MFG, the bilateral IPL and the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), whereas no specific region was found to be associated with the EC compared to the SS pain paradigms. This result is surprising given that several empirical studies (e.g.  ;  ), as well as qualitative reviews and theoretical papers (e.g.  ;  ;  ), support the functional dissociation between SS and EC pain cues during pain communication (e.g.  ) and empathy (e.g.  ). The unexpected finding could be explained by the definition of the different conditions, which are relatively broad and in which different constructs overlap. \n\nThe objectives of the current activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on pain empathy studies were 2-fold: first, to provide an up-to-date quantitative map of brain region and networks (the core network) involved in empathy for pain and, second, to address between-study methodological differences through a factorial- and theoretical-based framework (secondary networks). Between-study differences were systematically and quantitatively compared according to three factors and seven conditions that stem from the choice of methods for each included study. Importantly, these factors/conditions can also be organized in terms of their reliance on the different components of empathy proposed in contemporary neurocognitive models: visual cues (body parts submitted to noxious stimulations and facial expressions of pain), visuospatial perspective (first-person visual perspective and third-person visual perspective) and cognitive perspective (self-, stimuli- and other-oriented tasks). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Studies and coordinates selection \n  \nTo select fMRI studies using pain empathy paradigms, a systematic literature search was conducted between the 5th and 31th of January 2018 inclusively. Articles were obtained through online databases without any timeline restriction. Selected keywords were \u2018pain\u2019 in conjunction with \u2018fMRI\u2019 or \u2018MRI\u2019 or \u2018magnetic resonance imaging\u2019 or \u2018Imaging\u2019 in conjunction with \u2018empathy\u2019 or \u2018empathic\u2019 or \u2018empathie\u2019 or \u2018facial expression\u2019 or \u2018vicarious\u2019. This initial search led to a total of 717 articles across PubMed (  n  \u00a0=\u2009245), Embase (  n  \u00a0=\u2009243), Medline (  n  \u00a0=\u2009119), PsychINFO (  n  \u00a0=\u200991) and CINAHL (  n  \u00a0=\u200919) databases. A preselection of articles was done based on title and abstract by the authors Josiane Jauniaux and Ali Khatibi independently. Only empirical fMRI studies assessing vicarious pain and/or empathy published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Quantitative or qualitative reviews were excluded. A total of 193 potential studies were identified. \n\nThe identified studies were then independently inspected and counter-verified by authors Josiane Jauniaux and Ali Khatibi according to the following selection criteria: (i) studies using visual stimuli; (ii) studies on healthy populations; (iii) studies on clinical populations, health professionals, children, seniors and long-term mindfulness meditation practitioners reporting results from a control group separately; (iv) studies reporting MNI or Talairach coordinates; and (v) studies reporting results from regions of interest or whole-brain analysis. Studies that had first-hand pain, namely, studies applying nociceptive stimulations on participants and a pain empathy condition, but for which the pain empathy condition was not conducted simultaneously with the first-hand pain condition were also included. Studies using different conditions, for instance, showing pictures of individuals of different ethnicities, level of attractiveness or degree of familiarity, were considered as well. Studies using different conditions and/or tasks, for example, induced hypnotic analgesia, exposing participants to violent video games and induced stress, were included. To reduce the number of potential confounding variables, studies that used complex visual scenes (e.g. complex social scenarios, sports situations, abstract cues) or auditory stimuli (e.g. narratives or sounds to indicate that pain was being administered) were excluded. Studies using paradigms to induce social exclusion or during which participants needed to inflict pain upon someone were also excluded. Finally, studies using the same original data set as a previous published paper were removed. In sum, a total of 94 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. See   for a full overview of the study selection process. \n  \nDiagram outlining the study selection process.   n  , number of studies or experiments;   n   [f], number of foci;   n   [p], number of participants. \n  \nAmong those, fMRI coordinates were extracted from only 84 studies. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria but did not report the results for the contrast of either vicarious pain > no pain or vicarious pain > baseline. The findings for three of these studies could be included after the authors agreed to provide the data from this contrast. The final sample included 86 studies; 95 experiments; 2283 participants, about 46% of whom were women (at least 1061 women; 4 studies did not report the women/men ratio); and 1332 foci. Participants were all adults from the general population and were aged between 19 and 49 years (mean, 21.89 years; s.d.,\u00a02.96 years). Age and standard deviation averages were calculated based on the number of studies in which the age (73 studies) and standard deviation (63 studies) were reported and were weighted for the number of subjects in each study. Of these, not all studies reported standard deviation. Thus, the calculations are based on the available information. \n\nExperiments were categorized into three factors and seven conditions based on methodological variations and the processes involved. Two factors involved largely bottom-up (i.e. stimulus-driven) processes: visual cue and visuospatial perspective. The third factor engaged more top-down (i.e. instruction-driven and/or task dependent) processes, namely, the self/other cognitive perspective. For each of these factors, a set of corresponding conditions were identified, described in detail hereinafter. \n\nVisual cue refers to nature of the visual information available from the other\u2019s pain experience. Across paradigms, the visual cue presented is mainly SS (i.e. limbs exposed to noxious stimulations) or EC (i.e. social affective cues such as facial expressions of pain) in nature. Thus, the experiments were divided based on these two types of visual information forming two conditions. Some studies used both stimuli of the limbs in pain and facial expressions of pain within the same experimental condition in their experiment; these studies were taken into account in the general analysis for pain empathy but were not included in either the individual SS or EC condition. \n\nVisuospatial perspective refers to the spatial orientation of visual information, or the observer\u2019s point of view of the other\u2019s pain. Differences in visuospatial perspectives exist mainly across SS paradigms. Therefore, for this factor, only studies using SS paradigms were included. Stimulation of the limbs is generally presented from one\u2019s own perspective (1PP; 0\u201345\u00b0 angle) or a protagonist\u2019s perspective (3PP; 180\u00b0 angle). Thus, studies using an SS paradigm were divided based on these two visuospatial perspectives, leading to two conditions. Some studies used stimuli of the limbs presented from several visuospatial perspectives; these studies were included in the general analysis for pain empathy but were not added into the 1PP or 3PP condition. In the cases when researchers did not clearly report which visuospatial perspective was used for their stimuli, a short survey was sent to them in order to obtain this information (see   for more details). Following the authors\u2019 responses, 11 experiments were added to the factor visuospatial perspective. In total, 35 experiments were included in this factor. \n  \nList of references included in the meta-analysis and their corresponding factors and conditions \n    \nLastly, the self/other cognitive perspective, which relates to the cognitive and effortful process of taking either the self perspective or the other\u2019s perspective, has been manipulated through explicit instructions across paradigms. Three conditions were identified for this factor, namely, the self-perspective [self-oriented (SEO) tasks], the other perspective [other-oriented (OTO) tasks], or the neutral perspective [stimuli-oriented (STO) tasks]. More precisely, studies for which an instruction was given to the participants who oriented their attention toward a self-perspective were included in the SEO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to rate/evaluate/judge how they (the\nparticipants) felt empathic for the person, to share the emotional feelings of the person, to empathize with the person, to experience the feeling of the person, to indicate if they experience pain while viewing the person in pain or to explicitly take their own perspective. Studies using a photo cue (an image of the participant) to instruct the participants to adopt their perspective were also included in the SEO condition. Studies for which an instruction was given to the participants who oriented their attention toward the other perspective were included in the OTO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to rate/evaluate/judge the perceived unpleasantness and/or the intensity of the other\u2019s pain, to evaluate if the person was suffering from pain or not, to put themselves into the other\u2019s perspective, to imagine how the person feels, to imagine the emotions of the person or to put themselves into the perspective of an observer. Studies using a photo cue (a photo of a stranger) to indicate to the participants to adopt another perspective were also included in the OTO condition. Finally, studies for which an instruction was provided to the participants who oriented their attention toward the stimuli were included in the STO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to view the stimuli attentively, to passively view the stimuli, to carefully look at the stimuli, to watch the stimuli, to pay attention to the stimuli and then, in some cases, to press on a button when viewing the fixation cross. In some studies, the instruction given to the participants were not clearly reported. These studies were not included in any of the specific self/other cognitive perspective conditions but were taken into account in the general pain empathy analysis. Some researchers have used visual stimuli of the limbs and/or facial expressions of pain while using different instructions in their studies. In order to reduce the heterogeneity across studies included in the factor self/other cognitive perspective and to better isolate the effect of the cognitive perspective, at first, only studies using an SS paradigm were included in this factor. Then, analyses were carried out a second time, adding studies using an EC paradigm in order to examine whether the introduction of visual stimuli of facial expressions of pain would change the pattern of results. \n\n reports all studies included in the meta-analysis and their corresponding conditions.   reports the number of experiments, participants and foci by factors and conditions. See   for more methodological details regarding each study. \n  \nDescription of the sample: number of selected studies, experiments, foci and participants in each factor and their associated conditions \n  \nThe number in parentheses refers to the number of studies, experiments, foci and participants; included studies are those that used SS and EC pain paradigms for the self/other pain cognitive perspective taking factor. \n  \n\n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis: ALE \n  \nThe ALE method used in this study consists of modeling the uncertainty in localization of activation foci using Gaussian probability density distributions ( ,  ). Gaussian distributions quantitatively adjust for the spatial uncertainty resulting from between-participant and between-template variance of the neuroimaging foci in order to model the coordinates ( ). The width of these Gaussian functions is computed based on the number of participants in each experiment ( ). The resulting ALE value is an estimate of the probability that at least one of the foci in the studies coordinates is truly located at a given voxel value ( ). For more details about methodological procedures to compute ALE analyses, see the   User Manuel for Ginger ALE   ( ). \n\nFor the current study, the coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the latest version of the GingerAle software (version 2.3.6) available on the BrainMap web site ( ) ( ). From the selected studies, stereotactic coordinates from the main effect of vicarious pain > no pain or vicarious pain > baseline, independently from other variables (i.e. effect of a task, condition or group), were extracted and were used in order to conduct a general ALE map for all experiments (i.e. global pain empathy map). Due to the very small number of studies reporting decreases in activation (i.e. negative blood oxygen level-dependant contrasts), only increases in activation across and between studies were examined, and deactivation responses were excluded. Coordinates originally reported in Talairach space were converted to the MNI space using the Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation ( ;  ) implemented in Ginger ALE. It should be noted that the conventional terminology of the ALE method was used in this paper: the word \u2018experiment\u2019 refers to a single experimental contrast analysis, whereas the term \u2018study\u2019 refers to an empirical article reporting one or more experiments. \n\nConjunction and subtraction analyses were then conducted. To do so, pooled ALE maps were computed. A pooled map was generated for the visual cue factor by merging SS with EC conditions data sets. A pooled map was generated for the visuospatial perspective by merging 1PP with 3PP conditions data sets. Three pooled maps were generated for the self/other cognitive perspective by merging the following conditions: SEO with OTO, SEO with STO and OTO with STO. These pooled maps were computed a second time by adding studies using an EC paradigm. The following conjunction and subtraction analyses were performed for each factor:\n   \nVisual cue \n  \nSS   \u2229   EC \n  \nSS\u2009>\u2009EC \n  \nEC\u2009>\u2009SS \n    \nVisuospatial perspective \n  \n1PP   \u2229   3PP \n  \n1PP\u2009>\u20093PP \n  \n3PP\u2009>\u20091PP \n    \nSelf/other cognitive perspective taking \n  \nSEO   \u2229   STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSTO\u2009>\u2009SEO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO   \u2229   STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSTO\u2009>\u2009OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO   \u2229   OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO\u2009>\u2009OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n    \n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the cluster-level inference ( ,  ). A cluster-forming threshold of an uncorrected   P   value of 0.001 and a cluster-level inference threshold of 0.05 (permutation test) were applied for each factor (i.e. each pooled map) and for each of the seven conditions (i.e. each single ALE map). Contrasts and conjunction analyses were run with an uncorrected   P   value of 0.001 at first and then with a voxel-wise false discovery rates (FDRpNs) of 0.05 and 0.01 as the cluster-forming threshold to improve sensitivity to strong but focal activation. For all these analysis, a large mask size and the random-effect Turkeltaub nonadditive method were applied to minimize within-experiment and within-group effects ( ). Images were created using MRIcron software ( ). Broadman areas were determined using XJView ( ) from the coordinates found in the result files provided by the GingerAle software. \n  \nActivation likelihood clusters across all pain empathy experiments for the pain > no pain condition.

Regions consistently activated included frontal brain areas, including the IFG bilaterally (BA 44/45, extending dorsally to BA9 in the left hemisphere; BA 44 extending dorsally to BA6 in the right hemisphere), the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; the SMA) and the left aMCC. In the parietal lobes, the following regions were consistently activated across all pain empathy experiments: the bilateral IPL (anterior/dorsal to the TPJ) and the right SPL. Activation was also observed in the AI, posterior insula (PI) and fusiform gyrus bilaterally, and the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Subcortical regions including the thalamus, the amygdala and the lentiform nucleus/striatum also showed consistent activation across pain empathy experiments. Finally, activations were found in temporal\u2013occipital regions, such as the left IOG, inferior temporal gyrus [ITG; in the extrastriate body area (EBA)/occipital face area (OFA)] and the right MOG. Results are shown in  , and coordinates for all peak activations and ALE values are reported in  . \n\n\n### Visual cues \n  \nThe ALE map for SS alone showed significant clusters in the following regions: bilateral AI, MFG, PreCG, IFG, MOG, claustrum and thalamus; left ACC, aMCC, IPL, IOG, SFG, claustrum and putamen; and right PosCG, SPL, lateral globus pallidus (LGP) and fusiform gyrus (see   and   in   for peak activation coordinates and ALE values). The ALE map for EC alone showed significant clusters of activation in the bilateral IFG and ITG, left thalamus (ventral anterior and ventral lateral nucleus), AI, ACC, amygdala and right MTG (see  ; peak coordinates and ALE values are reported in  ). The conjunction analysis for SS and EC revealed consistent activity in the bilateral AI, bilateral ITG (EBA/OFA) and left ACC. The subtraction analysis showed activations for SS compared to EC in the bilateral IPL, SPL and AI/claustrum, left PI, and right PosCG and precuneus. The IFG was activated bilaterally for EC compared to SS (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). In summary, SS and EC pain paradigms were related to common [i.e. left ACC, bilateral AI and ITG (EBA/OFA, BA37)] and distinct [i.e. SS: bilateral IPL (BA40), AI and SPL (BA7); EC: bilateral IFG (BA44/45)] activations. \n\n\n### Visuospatial perspective \n  \nThe ALE single map for 1PP yielded convergence of increased activity in the bilateral IPL and SPL, right PI, IFG, claustrum, MFG, PreCG and MOG, and left AI, PreCG, ITG, aMCC/ACC and putamen (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). The ALE single map for 3PP yielded consistent activations in the bilateral PosCG and left AI, ACC, MOG and IPL (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). Conjunction analysis for both perspectives revealed bilateral activity in the PosCG, left AI, ACC and IPL ( ). Subtraction analysis revealed no specific clusters for the 1PP (1PP\u2009>\u20093PP) or 3PP (3PP\u2009>\u20091PP; see   for the peak activation coordinates and ALE values). Overall, based on the ALE single maps, the 1PP and 3PP conditions showed a similar pattern of activations. However, the 1PP condition was associated with a greater extent of activations in structures related to the affective and cognitive components of empathy (i.e. bilateral SPL, right IPL, PI, SPL, IFG, claustrum, and MOG, left ITG and putamen). Both visuospatial perspectives commonly recruited structures implicated in the affective component of empathy and self/other distinction (i.e. left AI, ACC, and IPL and bilateral PosCG). \n  \nActivation likelihood clusters for pain empathy experiments using SS or EC visual pain information during a pain > no pain condition.

Several clusters of activation were found for the SEO condition when studies using an EC paradigm were added, namely, the bilateral IPL and claustrum, and left AI, IFG, PreCG, aMCC, ACC and MFG. Refer to   in   for peak coordinates and ALE values. For the OTO condition, the single ALE map revealed consistent activation in the bilateral AI, IFG, MFG and fusiform gyrus; left PI, IPL, caudate head, ACC, claustrum and IOG; and right SPL, aMCC, culmen and PosCG (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). When adding studies using an EC paradigm, the analysis revealed a similar pattern, but with more regions of activation. Specifically, in this analysis, the bilateral AI, IFG, SPL, SFG and IPL, left ACC, claustrum, and fusiform gyrus and right MOG, were recruited (see  ). For the STO condition, the single ALE map showed consistent activations in the bilateral IPL and additionally in the right PosCG and IOG, and left IFG, PreCG, ITG and fusiform (  and  ). When adding studies using an EC paradigm, several additional clusters were found, including in the bilateral IPL, left AI, ITG, IFG and claustrum, and right PosCG, IOG, fusiform gyrus and SFG (see   for peak coordinate and ALE values). \n\nWhen running the conjunction and subtraction analyses, results showed common and distinct patterns of activation for certain conditions. Conjunction analyses showed consistent activities in the bilateral IPL, left PreCG and right MOG for the SEO and STO ( ); the bilateral IPL and left ACC, AI, MFG, IFG and SFG for SEO and OTO ( ); and the bilateral IPL, left ITG, PreCG and fusiform, and right PosCG for the OTO and STO ( ). The contrast STO\u2009>\u2009OTO was associated with activations in the right IOG, cerebellum and IPL, and left PreCG and IFG ( ). Other contrasts did not show significant activation (i.e. SEO\u2009>\u2009STO, STO\u2009>\u2009SEO, OTO\u2009>\u2009SEO, SEO\u2009>\u2009OTO and OTO\u2009>\u2009STO; see   for peak coordinates and ALE values for each of these analyses). When adding studies using an EC paradigms in the analyses for the self/other cognitive perspective factor, the conjunction analyses revealed consistent activity in the bilateral IPL, left PreCG, IFG and AI for the SEO and STO conditions; the bilateral IPL and left ACC, AI, claustrum, MFG and IFG for SEO and OTO conditions; and the bilateral IPL, left ITG, IFG and AI, and right PosCG and SFG for the OTO and STO conditions. The subtraction analysis STO\u2009>\u2009OTO was associated with consistent activation in the bilateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum, right IOG and SFG, and left IFG. The subtraction analysis SEO\u2009>\u2009OTO showed specific activations in the left AI for the SEO condition. Other contrasts did not show significant activations (i.e. SEO\u2009>\u2009STO, STO\u2009>\u2009SEO, OTO\u2009>\u2009SEO and OTO\u2009>\u2009STO).

Threshold for the conjunction and subtraction maps: cluster-forming   P  -uncorrected <0.001. \n  \nIn summary, based on the single ALE maps, results showed that other-oriented tasks were associated with a greater extent of activations in the core (i.e. left AI and right aMCC) and secondary (i.e. left MFG, right IFG, SPL and bilateral fusiform gyrus) brain networks related to pain empathy compared to self-oriented tasks. Other-oriented tasks were associated with a great extent of activation in the core (i.e. left AI/ACC) and secondary (i.e. left MFG, right PosCG, IFG, SPL and fusiform gyrus) compared to stimuli-oriented tasks. Self-oriented tasks were associated with a greater extent of activations in the core (i.e. left AI) and secondary (i.e. IFG) networks compared to stimuli-oriented tasks. In addition, the three types of tasks were related to common activations in the bilateral IPL. Other- and self-oriented tasks commonly activated the left AI and ACC. Finally, distinct activations were found for stimuli- compared to other-oriented tasks in frontoparietal (i.e. right IPL and left PreCG and IFG) and occipital (right IOG) structures in addition to the cerebellum when considering only SS pain paradigms. Self- compared to other-oriented task was related to distinct activations in the left AI when considering both SS and EC pain paradigms. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe neural correlates of empathy and its components have been explored using a number of pain empathy paradigms involving different stimuli, instructions and tasks. Failure to consider the underlying processes and these methodological variations in the study of empathy oversimplifies the interpretation of neuroimaging studies and can give a misleading impression of the results obtained with these diverse experimental conditions. The objectives of the current work were to provide a general quantitative map of brain structures involved in empathy based on previous fMRI studies on pain empathy and to replicate how empathy may reveal a core network, as previously found ( ;  ). Moreover, it aimed to explore secondary networks in empathy which may depend on specific properties of the stimuli and tasks used across these different studies. At first, a general coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis on 95 fMRI pain empathy experiments was conducted. Studies were then categorized based on their methodological variations, leading to three factors and seven conditions: pain visual cues (i.e. body parts in noxious situations and facial expressions of pain), pain visuospatial perspectives (i.e. IPP and 3PP), and self/other cognitive perspectives taking (i.e. self-, stimuli- and other-oriented tasks). ALE conjunction and subtraction analyses were carried out in order to investigate whether secondary networks could be related to these specific conditions. \n\n### Empathy and its related processes \n  \nIt is generally accepted that empathy is supported by two major components, an affective and a cognitive component ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The current research, which quantitatively synthesized almost a hundred fMRI experiments, supports this conceptualization, showing that pain observations recruit several structures throughout the brain networks associated with these empathy components. Indeed, the general analysis showed the engagement of frontal (i.e. IFG), parietal (i.e. SPL, IPL), sublobar (i.e. AI/PI, thalamus), limbic (i.e. aMCC/ACC, amygdala) and subcortical (i.e. cerebellum) structures, which are typically associated with the affective component of empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The study also showed activation of other parietal (i.e. IPL) and temporal (i.e. fusiform gyrus and ITG) structures, which are typically associated with the cognitive component of empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ). Although empathy can be divided into these two major components, more rudimentary processes may underlie these \u2018umbrellas components\u2019 ( ). The combined activation of the structures underlying these processes is likely to facilitate a fully empathic experience, as discussed hereinafter. \n  \nSignificant activation likelihood clusters for conjunctions and subtractions analyses for the self/other cognitive perspective taking factor \n  \nHigher ALE values or   Z   scores are associated with greater probability of activation across experiments. \n    \nSignificant activation likelihood clusters for conjunctions and subtractions analyses for the self/other cognitive perspective taking factor with studies using an SS or an EC paradigm \n  \nHigher ALE values or   Z   scores are associated with greater probability of activation across experiments. \n  \n#### An affective representation: at the core of pain empathy \n  \nThe current research shows that pain empathy relies on a core network of structures that include the AI and the aMCC/ACC. These regions were found to be consistently recruited across a variety of pain paradigms. Similar to   meta-analysis, the present analysis reveals a large number of clusters relating to activation of the AI and aMCC/ACC (69 and 49 clusters out of 95 related to the AI and aMCC/ACC, respectively). In addition, the AI and aMCC/ACC were consistently and commonly activated across different visual cues, visuospatial perspectives and self- and other-oriented perspective-taking instructions. These results also support those of other meta-analyses that found activation in the AI and aMCC/ACC during empathy for non-pain-related conditions ( ;  ;  ) and for empathy for non-pain-negative affective states ( ). Activity in these structures has been suggested to be associated with the affective/perceptual component of pain experience ( ;  ;  ), as well as with the affective-resonance component of empathy ( ;  ). Accordingly, our results of combined activation of the AI and aMCC/ACC are in line with the hypothesis of a shared neural representation related to the affective component of pain. It should be noted, however, that the meta-analysis of  ) showed that the amygdala, the rostal ACC and the posterior cingulate cortex were also commonly activated across the selected studies, results that were not replicated in the present study. The coordinated-based meta-analysis of  ) differed from the current analysis in that it was conducted with paradigms that employed visual, textual or auditory stimuli of social interactions during which participants watched passively or evaluated various dimensions of the others\u2019 emotional states. Although results from this previous meta-analysis diverge partly from the current results, it appears that the AI and the aMCC/ACC are consistently identified as part of what we call the core network of empathy. Additional structures may be recruited depending on the specific affective modality, visual information or perspective with which an observer is to empathize. \n\nAlthough the AI and the aMCC/ACC are suggested to be at the basis of an affective shared neural representation during empathy, evidence from other research fields suggests that these structures are also implicated in a variety of other functions. Although the AI and the ACC have been consistently shown to be related to nociceptive stimulation, it was alternatively proposed to view these areas being part of a functional system involved in detecting, orienting attention toward and reacting to salient sensory events ( ). Indeed, a neuroimaging review ( ) and meta-analysis ( ) suggest that the insula is a key node of the \u2018salience network\u2019 relating to the capacity to detect relevant stimuli in the environment. Additionally, research shows that the AI contributes to interoceptive representations and subjective awareness of the body\u2019s various states ( ,  ). Moreover, in relation to pain, a large body of evidence shows a posterior\u2013anterior functional dissociation within the insula. The posterior parts of the insula are suggested to integrate nociceptive afferents ( ), encode pain intensity ( ;  ), and may be related to preconscious pain perception ( ). In contrast, the anterior parts of the insula are suggested to underpin evaluative aspects of pain sensation ( ;  ) and conscious voluntary reactions ( ). Furthermore, a review suggests a caudal\u2013anterior and lateralized functional organization of the insula for pain experience and pain observation ( ). Within the left insula, the caudal to the mid-areas would be more related to pain experience, whereas the anterior areas would be preferentially associated with pain empathy. Within the right insula, pain experience would be related to the full caudal\u2013anterior spectrum. The anterior areas would be associated only in part with pain empathy. Since our results showed consistent activation in the anterior and caudal insula/PI bilaterally and more frequently in the AI, one may conclude that the insula cortices, in particular the anterior parts, may play an important role in detecting salient cues related to the other\u2019s pain in order to evoke a conscious interoceptive image of the other\u2019s pain sensation and intensity. \n\nAn ongoing debate challenges the previous assumptions about the specific function of the dorsal ACC (dACC) in pain ( ). A considerable body of evidence suggests that the dACC is responsive to pain ( ), pain empathy ( ) and both ( ). However, it would be misleading to say that this structure is   selective   to pain experience and/or pain observation, as it is also responsive to viewing or experiencing negative emotions ( ) and other cognitive functions, such as attention ( ;  ), inhibition ( ), and language, motor, learning and memory ( ), to name only a few. However, neuroscientists seem to agree on one point: the dACC \u2018subserves survival-relevant functions\u2019 ( );  ). More precisely, the dACC has been linked to the attentional control that serves to regulate cognitive processes and to adjust our behaviors in accordance with internal goals ( ). Based on a large-scale quantitative analysis of fMRI data,  ) proposed that the dACC serves an alarm-like function for goal-related conflicts requiring attention. During pain, the role of the dACC may therefore be to integrate basic affective and cognitive processes in order to assign and organize, in an attentional control manner, other brain functions and behaviors to assure survival. In addition, several studies show that brain responses in the AI and the ACC correlate with prosocial behaviors ( ;  ;  ). Our study suggests that such processes might take part in pain empathy, as the dACC and the AI were consistently activated during pain empathy. Perhaps the AI and ACCs constitute a network that, firstly, allows an internal, somatovisceral and conscious representation of the other\u2019s pain and, secondly, coordinates other brain functions to select adaptive behaviors such as empathic responses and prosocial behaviors. \n\n\n#### A somatosensorimotor representation \n  \nThe discovery of mirror neurons located in the ventral premotor cortex (F5) in nonhuman primates ( ) prompted affective and social neuroscientists to propose the perception\u2013action hypothesis, which stipulates that the perception of others\u2019 actions automatically activates the observer\u2019s brain representations of these actions ( ). More specifically, according to this hypothesis, a \u2018mirror mechanism would be at the basis of brain mechanisms that transform sensory representations of others\u2019 behaviour into one\u2019s own motor or visceromotor representations concerning that behaviour\u2019 ( ). Indeed, substantial evidence shows that observation of others\u2019 actions is related to a network of cortical structures typically activated when executing those actions in human (see  ;  ;  , for meta-analyses). These include the IPL, the ventral premotor cortex and the caudal part of the IFG (see Figure 2 in  ). Additional activations in the SPL ( ) and SMA ( ) have also been associated with action execution and action observation. In line with this prediction, our results show activation of such networks during pain empathy, with consistent activation observed in the IPL, ventral premotor cortex, and caudal part of the IFG, SPL and SMA. The experience of pain is associated with expected or observable actions, such as the withdrawal of a hand from a noxious object, which might engage this \u2018mirroring\u2019 system at the basis of the perception\u2013action coupling mechanism. In addition to an internal representation of the motor aspects of the other\u2019s pain, an SS representation of the observed pain might also be triggered during pain empathy. Indeed, our general map of pain empathy showed consistent activations in the SS cortices and thalamus, brain areas related to the capacity to discriminate sensory characteristics of direct pain experience, such as the intensity, quality and localization ( ;  ;  ). Thus, a shared neural representation of the other\u2019s SS pain characteristics might unfold during pain observation. Taken together, our results support the view that mirroring mechanisms might be at the origin of the activation of an embodied somatosensorimotor representation of the other\u2019s pain engaged during pain observation. \n\n\n#### Processing social nonverbal communication cues \n  \nIn addition to internal affective and somatosensorimotor representations of the other\u2019s pain, the current results suggest that visual processing of social nonverbal communication cues is performed through both shared and partly distinct channels during pain observation. Indeed, our general ALE map revealed consistent activations in the ITG, more specifically in the EBA and the OFA. Moreover, the conjunction analysis revealed that these structures were commonly activated in paradigms using SS (i.e. limbs submitted to noxious stimulation) and EC cues (i.e. facial expression of pain). The EBA/OFA are structures classically related to visual perception of human body parts ( ). Furthermore, the general ALE map revealed activation in the amygdala, a structure associated with relevant biological movements, for instance, faces and bodies expressing emotions ( ;  ;  ). The amygdala is also well known to be related to negative emotions such as fear and anxiety ( ), and a recent study showed that when instructed to rate their own affective responses to others\u2019 emotional faces, variations in participants\u2019 amygdala activation were related to the variations in their subjective responses ( ). The body and the face are important agents of communication during social interactions, as they both allow us to express and communicate emotions ( ). As consistent and concurrent activities of the EBA/OFA and amygdala were found in the current work, these regions may work in concert to detect and process socioemotional nonverbal communication cues during pain empathy. From an evolutionary point of view, the processing of socioemotional cues has an adaptive function of signaling potential dangers to prepare fight-or-flight responses ( ). When empathizing, the detection of socioemotional cues might be a basic process relevant in order to understand others\u2019 EC cues, for instance, of fear and/or anxiety, associated with the pain experience and to initiate, if needed, fight-or-flight responses. \n\nOur general ALE map across all selected fMRI studies on pain empathy provides quantitative meta-analytic evidence that several brain structures are implicated during pain observation; these brain structures subserve internal somatosensorimotor and affective representations of the other\u2019s pain, in addition to processing relevant social nonverbal communication cues. However, these results do not indicate if some of these structures could be a part of secondary networks involved in the processing of specific aspects of the other\u2019s pain experience or are related to different cognitive processes in the observers, such as taking different perspectives. ALE conjunction and subtraction analyses were performed to examine more closely how different visual pain cues and observers\u2019 perspectives might be related to specific networks. \n\n\n\n### Secondary networks implicated during pain empathy \n  \n#### Visual cues \n  \nIn addition to a core empathy network, secondary networks related to specific pain visual cues have been identified. Indeed, subtraction analysis revealed that SS cues (i.e. observation of body parts in painful situations) were related to activations in the SPL and IPL, in addition to the AI bilaterally. Pain empathy studies show that SS pain information generally involves action understanding (inferior parietal/ventral premotor cortices) and SS processes to a greater extent compared to other types of pain visual information, such as abstract cues ( ) or EC pain information ( ). In addition, as mentioned earlier, the AI is a key node permitting interoceptive and subjective representations of pain experience/observation and encoding evaluative aspects of pain. The results of the current work extend these findings and establish a distinct neural network engaged by the observation of SS pain cues during pain empathy. This type of pain visual cues seems to engage action understanding, SS sensation processes, and embodied conscious pain representation, and thereby probably engage a somatosensorimotor pain representation to a greater extent compared to EC pain cues. \n\nIn contrast, EC pain cues (i.e. facial expression of pain) were related to specific activations in the bilateral IFG (BA 45/47). The present results reveal new findings not reported in a recent ALE meta-analysis also examining differences between EC and SS pain cues ( ). Indeed, the study by  ) did not show distinct higher ALE values for EC pain cues compared to SS pain cues, as was found in the present study. The divergence of results may be related to differences in the number and selection of studies.  ) included 48 experiments that used an SS pain paradigm and 22 experiments that used an EC pain paradigm for their ALE contrasts analyses. In our work, we included 53 experiments in the SS pain condition and 25 experiments in the EC pain condition for our ALE contrasts analyses. In addition, the included experiments were not extracted from exactly the same studies. For instance, in the current work, some studies were excluded during the selection of the studies process, as they used complex visual scenes as stimulus or were not reporting results from a healthy adult population, and consequently were not included in the EC pain condition, which were included in  ). Inversely, some studies were included in the current meta-analysis (e.g.  ;  ), which were not in  ). It is, however, difficult to determine why these studies were not included in  ), as the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each condition (e.g. EC pain paradigm) were not specified in details. Thereby, a direct comparison of results of both meta-analyses based on the selected studies for each condition is hazardous. Another explanation could be related to differences in the choice of statistical thresholds. In  ), images were thresholded to a corrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 level using a cluster-level inference (5000 permutations, initial cluster-forming threshold of FDR   P  \u00a0<\u20090.01). In the current work, images were thresholded at first to an FDRpN   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 and then to an uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001 using a cluster-level inference (5000 permutations, initial cluster-forming threshold of FDR   P  \u00a0<\u20090.01). Clusters were found in the bilateral IFG with the uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001, whereas no cluster was found with an FDRpN   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05. Thereby, differences in results between  ) meta-analysis and current meta-analysis might be related to differences in thresholds. We cannot exclude that the distinct activation found in the bilateral inferior frontal lobule for the EC pain cue compared to somatosensory pain cue might be a false positive (as an uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001 increases the rate of false positives). However, the large number of empirical studies (e.g.  ;  ), as well as qualitative reviews and theoretical papers (e.g.  ;  ;  ) supporting the functional dissociation between SS and EC pain cues during pain communication (e.g.  ) and empathy (e.g.  ), instills confidence in the present findings. The absence of effect found in  ) might be related to a false negative due to a more conservative statistical control. A role for the IFG in the distinctive processing of EC cues appears highly plausible based on the available literature. \n\nThere are many studies supporting the multifunctional role of the IFG in human nonverbal communication during interpersonal interactions, including through intentional body movements (emblematic gestures;  ) and facial expression of pain (see  , for a review). Motor mirroring processes located in the IFG may allow human to understand others\u2019 communicative gestures, including facial expressions ( ;  ;  ). As the IFG is a structure classically related to speech production ( ), as well as face imitation ( ;  ;  ), social-affective researchers have suggested that there may be a common evolutionary root between speech production and gesture recognition, which would permit the understanding of others\u2019 communicational cues during nonverbal interactions ( ) and more broadly during empathy ( ;  ). \n\nOur results are also consistent with other studies showing the involvement of the IFG during empathy ( ;  ). In particularly, the left IFG is found to be related to the evaluation of emotional face expressions ( ). In  ,  ), the evaluation and production of meaningful facial expressions of pain were related to a greater activation in the IFG compared to the discrimination and imitation of motor components of the same facial expressions. In another study, a group of patients with lesions in the either left (  n  \u00a0=\u20093) or right (  n  \u00a0=\u20095) IFG (BA 44/45) showed altered emotional empathic abilities, as measured by the two affective scales (personal distress and empathic concern) of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ( ). These results suggest that the IFG not only contributes to understanding others by imitation but also subserves an affective/evaluative aspect of the other\u2019s pain experience. In sum, our results are in line with previous studies supporting the important role of the IFG in the evaluative/affective component of the other\u2019s pain when the pain experience is communicated through sociocommunicative cues. Facial expressions of pain may be a symbolic and abstract gesture of the affective pain experience shared by others. \n\nTaken together, results of the current work expand upon previous findings and add robustness to the neural dissociation related to distinct pain visual cues. Our results, which are based on a large data set of neuroimaging literature, establish a neural dissociation between SS and EC pain information during pain empathy. SS cues activated brain areas associated with somatosensorimotor resonance (SPL, IPL, AI), whereas EC cues activated distinctly regions related to social nonverbal communication, such as gestures and affective resonance (IFG). \n\n\n#### Visuospatial perspective \n  \nUnlike visual pain information, differences in visuospatial perspectives do not seem to recruit specific neural networks, although differences in activation were found in a number of brain regions. Indeed, based on the subtraction analyses, no specific clusters were found to be consistently activated for the 1PP or the 3PP. However, when examining the single ALE map of both perspectives separately, some differences can be observed. A first-person compared to a third-person visuospatial perspective seems to evoke a larger number of brain activations related to somatosensorimotor resonance (SPL, IFG, premotor and SMA cortices) and visual perception of body parts (ITG/EBA), suggesting that a 1PP results in a more robust embodied self-pain representation. This result is consistent with previous studies documenting the effect of the visuospatial perspective on neural response during pain observation. Pain assessment responses are faster ( ), pain evaluation is higher ( ), and brain activity is greater ( ;  ) when viewing limbs in noxious situations from a 1PP compared to a 3PP. In sum, a 1PP seems to facilitate pain somatosensorimotor resonance, but such differences should be interpreted with caution given the absence of significant effect in the contrast analyses. Future brain imaging research should further examine how activity within those areas relates to relevant behavioral responses to pain in self and others. \n\n\n#### Cognitive perspective \n  \nTo date, studies on cognitive perspective during pain observation are inconsistent and limited. On the one hand, studies show that imagining oneself in pain during pain empathy paradigms is related to higher self-ratings ( ;  ) and enhanced activation in brain structures related to SS resonance (SII) and affective resonance (ACC and insula) ( ;  ;  ). For instance,   noted a higher signal change associated with a self-oriented perspective in the middle insula and PI compared to adopting the perspective of a sufferer. On the other hand, in the study by  , no effect of the instruction was identified at either the behavioral or neural level, regardless of the visuospatial perspective. The current study provided a meta-analytic examination of the effect of instructions designed to orient the participant\u2019s perspective toward the self- or the other\u2019s pain. \n\nBased on the subtraction analysis, the current study showed no specific activation related to a self- or other-oriented perspective considering only paradigms using SS pain visual cues. However, when considering paradigms using SS and EC visual cues, specific activations were found in the left AI for the self- compared to other-oriented perspective. A self-oriented instruction seems to rely more on an embodied pain representation compared to other-oriented instruction, but this effect is found only when both SS and EC pain cues are used. As shown earlier, the present study tend to support the idea that SS compared to EC pain visual information enhance activity in regions related to pain somatosensorimotor resonance (i.e. superior parietal lobule, IPL, and AI) to a greater extent. Perhaps, when using an instruction designed to modulate the participant\u2019s perspective on top of viewing SS visual cues only, the effect of instructions is too small to be detected. \n\nThe current research also demonstrates that instructing participants to direct their attention toward the stimulus (stimulus-oriented perspective) during pain empathy was related to activations in specific regions compared to an instruction orienting the participants\u2019 attention toward the others, namely, in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, MOG/IOG, IPL and PreCG/IFG. The attention network model of  ) suggests a large-scale dorsal frontoparietal network that embodies orienting attention processes to the external environment by sending top-down biasing signal to sensory input. Indeed, if a person directs his or her attention toward a particular sensory modality, information processing is greatly facilitated for the corresponding stimuli and suppressed for the nonattended stimuli ( ). Moreover, activation can increase in the bilateral inferior frontal areas and in the anterior core of the dorsal network during tasks where participants are required to detect a target presented in a stream of frequent and standard stimuli (see  , for a quantitative fMRI meta-analysis). Here, the higher ALE values in occipital and frontoparietal areas for stimulus-oriented compared to other-oriented instructions may reflect a stronger exteroceptive attentional focus in the former condition. Rather than allowing participants to process pain stimuli according to how they naturally attend to the other\u2019s emotional state, a stimulus-oriented instruction could shift the participants\u2019 attention more toward the visual features of the stimuli. In other words, using a stimuli-oriented instruction during a pain empathy task seems to increase top-down attentional control subserved by the dorsal frontoparietal network. \n\nFinally, when comparing the single ALE maps for the self- and other-oriented perspectives, a larger number of brain regions related to the pain empathy network are observed for the other-oriented perspective. A possible explanation may be related to the greater variability in the instructions verbatim used to orient the participants\u2019 perspective and spontaneous strategies adopted by participants to orient their perspective. Across the studies using a self-oriented instruction, some provided more precise instructions than others on how to adopt a self-oriented perspective. For example, some studies requested participants to \u2018try to experience the feelings of the person whose body part is shown in the pictures\u2019 (e.g.  ). This type of formulation is more specific and may help participants accomplish the task more adequately and minimize heterogeneity across participants. Other studies using a self-oriented instruction mentioned to \u2018take their own perspective\u2019 (e.g.\n ). This type of instruction is more abstract and may be interpreted differently between participants. On the other hand, studies using other-oriented instructions usually used either a pain discrimination task or a pain evaluation task. In these studies, instructions are generally more precise and clear. This type of task may engage participants more in the other\u2019s pain experience and therefore in a more embodied pain experience. \n\nAnother explication could be that some studies included a behavioral measurement (e.g. rating the level of unpleasantness and/or of intensity of the pain or rating the amount of the pain on a visual analog scale or a Likert scale) while others not, and this is not perfectly distributed across our conditions over the whole sample of studies. Also, for studies that included a behavioral measurement, the rating period could be before, during or after the scanning session and thereby be or not part of the targeted period of interest. From a set of 15 experiments that used an SS paradigm included in the self-perspective condition, 47% were asking the participants to rate something during the scanning session. From a set of 17 experiments that used either an SS or an EC paradigm included in the self-perspective condition, 47% were using rating during the scanning session. From the set of 36 experiments that used an SS paradigm included in the other-perspective condition, 67% were using rating during the scanning session. From the set of 47 experiments that used either an SS paradigm or an EC paradigm included in the other-perspective condition, 72% were using rating during the scanning session. All these differences related to the behavioral measures (i.e. the moment of rating, the type of rating, the instructions of the ratings, etc.) are all possible confounding variables and could have influenced the processes (e.g. motor, anticipation, action, monitoring, etc.) at play during the conditions. See column Behavioral Measures in   for more details on these methodological differences. \n\n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSeveral efforts have been made to carry out an exhaustive search and to obtain a maximum of experiments in each condition. Nevertheless, three conditions had a low number of experiments for the ALE quantitative analysis (  n  \u00a0=\u200910 for third-person visuospatial perspective,   n  \u00a0=\u200915 for self-oriented cognitive perspective,   n  \u00a0=\u20098 for stimuli-oriented cognitive perspective).  ) suggested that an ALE meta-analysis requires at least 20 experiments to achieve a reasonable power. Meanwhile, the results in  ) indicate a relatively good balance between type I and II errors, with conditions involving only 10 experiments. An up-to-date meta-analysis might be necessary in the near future to strengthen or perhaps to nuance the available findings and interpretations once additional fMRI studies of pain empathy are conducted for these more specific conditions. Another explanation for the lack of significant results for some of the analyses conducted, in particular the subtraction analyses, can possibly stem from the methodological discrepancies among the experimental designs across studies. Indeed, other factors might contribute to the heterogeneity across studies: methodological factors, such as the inclusion or not of a behavioral measure (i.e. to rate different aspects of the pain) during the scanning session, characteristics of the targets depicted in the stimuli and/or sociodemographic characteristics of participants. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, undertaking a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on pain empathy and comparing the influence of different pain empathy paradigms on the brain response are essential steps to gain an improved understanding the neurobiological basis of human empathy. Synthesizing the abundance of fMRI reports on pain empathy allows for improved sample size, statistical power and validity compared to considering only results from single neuroimaging studies. The current meta-analysis demonstrates that empathy recruits different neural networks associated with affective resonance, somatosensorimotor resonance and the processing of nonverbal socioemotional communicational cues. Moreover, this work provides evidence that differences in emotional visual information, visuospatial perspective and cognitive perspective taking involve the brain networks underpinning empathy to varying degrees. In addition, results suggest that pain empathy paradigms are particularly efficient in recruiting brain structures that are related to the affective components of empathy (i.e. AI and aMCC/ACC), as well as the regions related to pain somatosensorimotor resonance (i.e. IPL, SPL and IFG). This highlights the need to develop other paradigms that would particularly solicit other components of empathy, such as the cognitive component of empathy, or emotion regulation processes in the context of pain, as this would help to broaden our understanding of empathy processes and their related neural correlates. Finally, although different neural networks implicated in empathy have been identified, it remains unclear how these networks are interrelated. As empathy emanates from several interacting components, fMRI studies using global multivoxel pattern analysis and investigating connectivity patterns would be relevant in order to yield stronger interpretations of the interrelations between these networks. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors certify that they have no actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding the research reported in this article. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6847411, "text_md5": "a06d13a94b8c48d3b03bc45393119060", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 78], "journal": [79, 103], "publication_year": [105, 109], "title": [120, 248], "keywords": [262, 363], "abstract": [376, 1868], "body": [1877, 72383]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31393982, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsz055", "pmcid": "6847411", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6847411", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6847411"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6847411\">6847411</a>", "list_title": "PMC6847411  A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on pain empathy: investigating the role of visual information and observers\u2019 perspective"}

Sleep time occupies up to a third of the human lifespan.  With the increasing pressure of external factors such as modern society, environment, and working mode, the incidence rate of insomnia disorder is increasing year by year. Insomnia is a subjective feeling that sleep time and sleep quality do not meet daytime social function, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness.  Prevalence estimates for insomnia symptoms range between 30% and 50%  in the general adult population and up to 80% in patients with psychiatric illnesses.  There is a complex two-way relationship between insomnia and negative emotions such as depression and anxiety, which interact with each other, are relatively independent.  Long term insomnia or low sleep quality will lead to the imbalance of the interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and cause anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions.  When the body is in a state of tension and anxiety for a long time, the sensory function of the nervous system will be extremely sensitive, causing difficulty in falling asleep, easy to wake up, aggravating sleep disorders, forming a vicious circle.  Research using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) suggests that insomnia is related to arousal, emotion, reward, and abnormal functional activities in cognitive brain regions.  It is not only related to functional abnormalities in local brain regions, but also related to abnormal internal connections of default network, prominence network, and emotional network. \n\nAt present, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia is in the world. Due to less doctors and more patients, high work intensity and other reasons, the proportion of sleep in medical workers is seriously imbalanced, which is more likely to lead to insomnia and other sleep problems.  According to the latest sleep survey report released by the China Sleep Research Association, at present, more than 300 million people in China have sleep disorders, and the COVID-19 epidemic has delayed falling asleep for 2 to 3 hours. Long term insomnia can affect the emotion, learning, memory, and other functions of medical workers, resulting in the decline of work efficiency and the increase of error rate.  Therefore, how to reduce the negative impact of insomnia and other sleep problems on medical workers and improve the quality of medical service has become the key problem to be solved urgently. \n\nAcupuncture is one of the important complementary and alternative therapies. Many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety,  but its specific mechanism needs to be further explored. Rs-fMRI is an important means to study the neural mechanism, because of its good repeatability, noninvasive, and other advantages, it has become the preferred method of modern neuroimaging research. In rs-fMRI technology, by using the analysis method of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), it can reflect the changes of spontaneous brain activity more stably and accurately in the resting state. Some studies have explored the characteristics and rules of brain activity changes in insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety patients treated with acupuncture by calculating the changes of ALFF and Reho in the brain. However, the results are inconsistent due to the differences of inspection equipment, test standards of analysis software and sample size. Therefore, this study used meta-analysis method to integrate and analyze the changes of ALFF and Reho, and to explore the characteristics and rules of acupuncture on the changes of brain activity in insomnia comorbid with emotional disorders, in order to provide effective evidence for the elucidation of its pathogenesis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe protocol of this meta-analysis will be conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols statement guidelines.

The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials. Gov, will be searched for ongoing or have finished trials with unpublished data. \n\n\n\n### Data collection and analysis \n  \n#### Selection of studies \n  \nClinical studies will be identified and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers (LY and ML). In order to ensure that the reviewers have a good understanding of the background and purpose of the review, they will be trained in advance. Use NoteExpress 3.2.0 software (Available at:  ) to independently manage the search results from above-mentioned databases. Firstly, remove the duplicate literature. Secondly, after reviewing the title and abstract, excluding the literature that does not comply with the standard. Finally, further review the full text and rule out the literature that is not line with the standard. Any disagreements related to study selection results will be discussed after cross-checking and arbitrated by the third reviewer (HZ). The flow diagram of all study selection procedure is shown in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of the study process. PRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. \n  \n\n#### Data extraction and management \n  \nTwo reviewers (JC and YL) will independently screen the study and extracted data, and if there were differences of opinion, the third reviewer (HH) intervened to discuss. According to the designed data extraction table, the basic information of the study including: \n  \nidentification information (article name, publication year, first author); \n  \ngeneral information (country, study type, sample size, and study design); \n  \nparticipants (age, sex, and scale and fMRI results before treatment); \n  \ninterventions (type of acupuncture, acupuncture points selection, and treatment frequency/session/duration); \n  \ncomparator (if there is any, details of the treatment including therapeutic method, dosage, frequency, and course); and \n  \noutcomes (time, scale and fMRI results points for each measurement, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index , Hamilton Depression Scale , Hamilton Anxiety Scale, ReHo and ALFF, as well as follow-up duration, and adverse events). \n  \n\n#### Addressing missing data \n  \nFor study with missing data or clarification for unclear information, we will try to contact corresponding authors for further information. Otherwise, we will analyze the existing information and conduct sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of missing data. \n\n\n#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies \n  \nAccording to the bias risk assessment tool of Cochrane system reviewer's Handbook V.5.1.0, the bias risk of included literatures will be evaluated by 2 reviewers (LY and ML) independently evaluated each of the following items as \u201clow risk,\u201d \u201chigh risk,\u201d or \u201cunclear risk\u201d: \n  \nselection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), \n  \nperformance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), \n  \ndetection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), \n  \nattrition bias (incomplete outcome data), \n  \nreporting bias (selective reporting), \n  \nother bias (such as presample size estimation, early stop of trial). \n  \n\n#### Quality of evidence assessment \n  \nAccording to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method,  2 reviewers (JC and YL) will use the GRADE rating standards to independently assess the quality of evidence for each outcome as 4 levels: \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d quality. The quality of evidence quality will be assessed according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. \n\n\n#### Data synthesis and analysis \n  \nRevMan software (Version 5.3) (Available at:  ) and stata13.1 (Available at:  ) will be used for meta-analysis. The count data were represented by relative risk and continuous variables by standardized mean difference. 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated for both. The heterogeneity of the included studies was judged by   I   value, with   P  \u200a<\u200a.05 as the statistical difference.   I   values of 0% to 24.9%, 25% to 49.9%, 50% to 74.9%, and 75% to 100% respectively indicate zero, low, medium, and high heterogeneity. When   P   \u2265 .10 and   I  \u200a<\u200a50%, fixed effect model was used to analyze the heterogeneity. Otherwise, metaregression analysis was used to analyze the source of heterogeneity. If clinical heterogeneity could not be excluded, random effect model (mantel-Haenszel) was selected. The bias of the study was analyzed by Egger test and funnel plot (  P  \u200a<\u200a.05). \n\n\n#### Subgroup analysis \n  \nSubgroup analysis will be conducted to evaluate the specific influence of intervention type, acupoints selecting, acupuncture manipulatio, treatment duration on pooled results. If the data is insufficient, qualitative synthesis will be conducted instead of quantitative synthesis. \n\n\n#### Patients and public involvement \n  \nThere was no patient or public participation in the formulation of the study protocol. Patients will not participate in data collection and analysis of systematic review and meta-analysis. \n\n\n#### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nSince this meta-analysis will use data from published studies to extract data without involving individuals or privacy, there is no need for ethics approval or patient consent. The results of this meta-analysis will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nLong term insomnia or low sleep quality will have harmful effects on the spirit and cognition of patients,  resulting in decreased alertness and increased the occurrence of accidents, errors, and injuries.  Healthcare support personnel and healthcare practitioners represent 2 of the 5 occupational groups with the highest prevalence of short sleep duration.  Nearly 30% of resident physicians and 20% of hospital-based nurses suffer from depression, a rate 2 to 3-fold higher than the general public.  A number of studies have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating insomnia comorbid with emotional disorders, and acupuncture has the characteristics of simple, convenient, and nontoxic side effects. Therefore, acupuncture therapy is more and more widely used to improve the symptoms of patients with insomnia and the impact on life and work. \n\nWith the rapid development of imaging technology, such as Electroencephalogram, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Computed Tomography, Magnetoencephalography, Positron Emission Tomography, and now the most popular Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The development of these technologies has made a greater breakthrough in the positioning and integration of brain function. Rs-fMRI has been widely used in the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of diseases. Research shows that acupuncture can regulate the emotion of insomnia patients, the functional activities of cognitive brain area and the functional connection of functional brain network.  In rs-fMRI, the ALFF method can accurately reflect the spontaneous activity of neurons in resting state from the point of view of energy,  the increase of ALFF indicates the increase of spontaneous activity in this brain region, on the contrary, it indicates that the spontaneous activity is decreased. ReHo is used to measure the local consistency of spontaneous blood oxygen level dependence in specific brain regions in the resting state, and can stably reflect the time synchronization of local brain neuronal activity.  These 2 methods can be used to explore the characteristics and rules of spontaneous brain activity changes in patients, in order to reveal the relevant mechanism. \n\nIn recent years, there have been studies on the application of rs-fMRI to explore the mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety, but no related systematic review and meta-analysis have been published. This study will include and integrate the latest and most comprehensive literature in this field to explore the effects of acupuncture on brain activity in patients with insomnia comorbid with emotional disorders. However, this study has some limitations. First of all, the relevant research literature is insufficient and may not be able to carry out further correlation analysis, such as subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. In addition, there may be heterogeneity between studies due to the use of different evaluation criteria and acupuncture methods. In summary, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence-based medicine basis for elucidating the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia comorbid with emotional disorders. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Formal analysis:   Lin Yao, Mengyuan Li. \n\n Investigation:   Lin Yao, Mengyuan Li, Jiazhen Cao, Yanze Liu. \n\n Methodology:   Lin Yao, Mengyuan Li, Jiazhen Cao, Yanze Liu. \n\n Project administration:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Resources:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Supervision:   Haizhu Zheng. \n\n Validation:   Haizhu Zheng. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Lin Yao. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Haipeng Huang, Hongfeng Wang. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 8136997, "text_md5": "dc98343fa33788b4e210146fc238c259", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 113], "journal": [114, 134], "publication_year": [136, 140], "title": [151, 244], "keywords": [258, 347], "abstract": [360, 2320], "body": [2329, 19361]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34011090, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000025988", "pmcid": "8136997", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136997", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8136997"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136997\">8136997</a>", "list_title": "PMC8136997  Study on acupuncture improving insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety based on rs-fMRI"}

Though controversial, Brinley plots can assess between-task differences, the impact of increasing task demand, and the relationship between responses in two groups of subjects. Since a relationship exists between response times and the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI), Brinley's plotting method could be applied as a meta-analysis tool in fMRI studies of aging. Here, fledgling \u201cPeiffer plots\u201d are discussed for their potential impact on understanding general cognitive brain activity in aging. Preliminary results suggest that general cognitive slowing may be localized at the sensorimotor transformation in the precentral gyrus. Although this meta-analysis method is naturally used with imaging studies of aging, theoretically it may be applied to other study pairs (e.g., schizophrenic versus normal) or imaging datasets (e.g., PET). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. INTRODUCTION \n  \nIn the mid 1960s, Brinley \npresented a novel plotting \nmethod to consider the\nrelationship between response times in young and older \nadults across a variety\nof tasks with varying levels of cognitive difficulty \n[ ]. The average response times\nfor both the young and older groups of adults on each task was \nplaced on a\nscatter-plot, and a regression line was then fitted to the \ndata using the\noperation of  . \nIn doing so, a relationship was \nrealized between the\nbehavior in young adults and its ability to predict behavior \non the same task\nin older adults. The power of this method of data analysis is \nthat it can be\nused across task types to pool data from multiple studies. \nHere we harvest the\npowerful aspects of the Brinley analysis method and apply \nthem to functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Meta-analyses of \nfMRI data are\ntypically hindered by differences in the types of tasks \nused across studies.\nThe use of the Brinley method allows for a \nmeta-analysis of fMRI data that\nactually takes advantage of multiple cognitive tasks. \nHowever, the remaining\nchallenge is to carefully interpret the findings. \n\nThe history of Brinley plots is rife with \ndebate and discussion on what the plot is measuring\nand what it means. Feelings in opposing camps can \neven be so strong as to\nelicit T-shirts emblazoned with the No symbol over \nthe word Brinley. Later\nresearchers inferred that aspects of Brinley plots \ncould provide information on\ngeneral cognitive functioning in older adults since \nBrinley's data contained\nboth task switching and nonswitching data subsets \n[ \u2013 ]. For example, if the slope\nfor the fitted line of a group of tasks is 1, then there is \nequal change between tasks for younger and older adults. \nHowever, when the slope of the\nfitted line deviates and is greater than 1, there is \nan increased slowing in\nolder adults associated with more cognitively demanding tasks \n(i.e., a general cognitive slowing deficit is evident in \nolder adults regardless of task [e.g., \n[ ]]). Other researchers have\ndisagreed with this Brinley plot interpretation and suggest \nthat the plot\nreflects a difference in response variability \nbetween the age groups rather\nthan processing speed, per se \n[ ]. \nFinally, current work in how\naging affects processing speed questions the degree \nto which general cognitive\nslowing can be summarized with one linear \nfunction across all types of tasks \n[ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn addition to describing the behavioral appearance \nof cognitive slowing, research\nhas pursued localizing the phenomenon within the \naging brain. Generalized\ncognitive slowing has been thought to \nresult from pervasive slowing of all\ncognitive brain functions in older adults. \nWith this in mind, some researchers\nhave proposed that the locus of general \ncognitive slowing occurs where sensory\nimpulses transfer to a common site of motor \ngeneration for the response and\nthat this sensorimotor dysregulation intensifies \nwith more difficult tasks [ \u2013 ]. Yordanova and colleagues\nfound evidence to support this hypothesis using event-related \npotentials, which\nare able to evaluate the timing and strength \nof cognitive processing in\nresponse to external stimuli \n[ ]. However, when considering\ntask-specific slowing impact, other researchers point to \nadditional slowing in\nspecific cognitive areas such as working memory, \nvisual search and mental\nrotation [ , \n ], \nwhich may occur in addition to\nor instead of the sensorimotor slowing. \n\nAfter reviewing the body of research literature \non general cognitive slowing in\naging, we adopted the early Brinley method \nfor plotting reaction times and\napplied it to the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) \nsignal from multiple fMRI\nstudies. In doing so, an attempt is made to localize \nbrain areas responsible\nfor the deviant slope in the response time Brinley plot. \nUnlike reaction times,\nthe BOLD signal has a \nlegitimate negative value\n(i.e., deactivations) that occurs when contrasting activity \nduring two different events. For example, \ncertain brain areas are more active during\nbaseline than during any particular task. \nThese areas prominently include\nposterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobe \nareas and are known as\nthe default network [ ]. \nIn applying Brinley's\nplotting method on the BOLD signal, we are able to construct \nnovel Peiffer\nplots, a meta-analysis of fMRI data that is not limited to \nsite locations of\nactivation maxima and thus not skewed to evaluate only areas \nidentified as\nstatistically different within a study \n[see discussion in [ ]]. \nTypical meta-analyses of\nfMRI data use location-centered approaches \nwhere the focus of peak activity is\nevaluated [ \u2013 ]. This can underestimate\nbetween-task differences because subthreshold \nactivity differences are\noverlooked [see discussion in [ ]]. \nFurther, differences in task\nparameters and paradigm domain limit the tasks \ncompared in many fMRI\nmeta-analyses to a single type of task \n(e.g., Stroop interference task \n[ , \n ]). \nWith the novel method\nproposed here, a plot can be made across a \nvariety of fMRI studies to evaluate\ntwo different population groups to identify areas \nshowing between-task\ndifferences that may not necessarily be identified as \ndeviant within an\nindividual study comparison. Lastly, in using this method to \ncompare young and\nolder adults, we may be able to show localization of the areas \nthat may in fact\nidentify differences in age-related information \nprocessing that characterize\ngeneral cognitive slowing. \n\n\n## 2. METHODS \n  \nBOLD data and behavioral response times were obtained from 4 simple \ndetection tasks (3 visual and 1 auditory). In order to plot a BOLD signal value \nfor young and older adults in each study, original fMRI data was needed. \nThe fMRI Data Center ( ) contributed a complete dataset from Buckner and colleagues \n(Accession no. 2-2000-1118W) for 2 points in\nthe analysis (young = 14; older adults = 14) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements related to responses associated with the \npresentation of a single\nor double flashing checkerboard. The other 2 points were \nfrom studies performed\nin our laboratory (young = 20; older adults = 20) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements were related to block activity during an \nauditory task where\nsubjects needed to respond when they heard a target tone or \nin a visual task\nwhere they responded to the blurring of a flashing checkerboard. \nFor all points\nin the meta-analysis, all fMRI comparisons were between \ntask and baseline\n(i.e., fixation cross) and were preprocessed with global \nsignal correction. Further,\nduring the preprocessing of the data, \nit is spatially normalized to MNI\ntemplate space. Normalized task specific \n\u201ccon\u201d images reflecting the\ntask-related BOLD activity change from baseline \nwere computed with SPM99 for\nall individuals in each dataset. These individual \n\u201ccon\u201d images were then\naveraged within age group for each study resulting in a \ntotal of 8 average BOLD\nactivity maps (2 age groups over 4 tasks). \nThis process emulated the\nconstruction of a traditional Brinley plot which averaged \nthe response times\nfor each task within each age group. \nWithin the BOLD average signal maps, each\nvoxel contains a value representing the age \ngroup's average BOLD activity for\nthat task at that standardized MNI   \ncoordinate. \n\nUsing the 4 average young maps as observed  -values and\nthe corresponding 4 average older adult maps as observed \n -values, a linear\nregression analysis   was calculated \nwithin each voxel that contained\nat least 3   data points (see   for \na representative voxel). Individual 3D maps were computed that contained \nvoxels with individual\nregression parameters of interest (e.g., slope, b-intercept, \nR-square, predicted  -value, etc.). \nSince the null hypothesis H  in question was whether or\nnot there was equivalent change between young and older \nadults across tasks,\nthe slope value for H  was 1. To evaluate \nH  :  , the\nabsolute residual values were calculated at each data point in \nSPM2  . \nThe resulting 8 residual maps (2\nage groups over 4 tasks) were then statistically compared \nusing a t-test in\nSPM. When the n is large enough, theoretically, \nit would be more statistically\ncorrect to analyze the difference between these residuals with \na paired t-test.\nIf the null hypothesis was true, \nthen the absolute residual values would be\nequal and not statistically different from each other \n . \nIf the slope was not equal to 1, then the\nvoxel's t-test would be significant \n .\nMultiple comparisons were controlled for by using FWE of \n  < 0.05 and an\nextent threshold of at least 3 consecutive voxels. \nThe sign (+ or \u2212) and value of\nthe slope could then be assessed to determine how \nthe two groups deviated in \ntheir BOLD signals across the tasks plotted in the analysis \n(e.g., one group activates an area more across tasks then the other group). \n\nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, \nslopes of \u22121 should not be considered as\npart of the null hypothesis, since the direction of \nactivity across tasks for\nthe age groups would actually be opposite \n(i.e., young adults activating across\ntasks while older adults deactivate). \nTherefore, it is also important to\ninvestigate areas where the slope is significantly negative, \nsince the above\n\u201cresidual\u201d analysis would not just eliminate slopes \nof +1 but also slopes which\nwere not significantly different from \u22121. \nAn example of this can be seen in the\nplotted data of   \nin which this particular voxel would not be significant\nin the above \u201cresidual\u201d analysis, but still \nrepresents an interesting result. Significant\nvoxels with a slope of \u22121 can be identified using the \n -value \nof the regression\nused to fit the Peiffer plot \n(i.e.,   < .05 for the slope to be different from\nzero). Three contiguous voxels with a significant regression \n -value \nand a negative slope will be \nconsidered a cluster of interest as well. \n\nTo evaluate a significant voxel's b-intercept, \nthe 95% confidence interval was assessed. If this interval\ncontained zero, the voxel's b-intercept was considered \nnot to deviate from\nzero. Again, b-intercept clusters were considered \nsignificant if they contained\nat lest 3 contiguous voxels with significantly nonzero \nb-intercepts. \n\n\n## 3. RESULTS \n  \nThe traditional Brinley plot using average response times \nacross the 4 tasks included in the fMRI meta-analysis showed the established \ndifferences between young and older adults \n(see  ). \nThe slope of 1.4 supports general\ncognitive slowing within the dataset even though \nrelatively simple response\ntime tasks were used, and although uninterpretable \nfor response time data, the\nnegative b-intercept is also typical. With a slope \ngreater than one, older\nadults had greater differences between \ntasks in response time than younger\nadults. \n\nFor the fMRI meta-analysis, five distinct clusters \nsurvived the stringent correction applied\nfor multiple comparisons. The location of these clusters \nis summarized visually\nin   and details \nare given in Table 1\n. \nClusters of interest to competing\ntheories of general cognitive slowing were \nfound within the left pre- and\npostcentral gyrus areas as well as within the right \nmedial frontal gyrus. All\nclusters identified in the analysis had, on average, \na slope that was\nsignificantly less than one yet significantly greater \nthan negative one (see  ). \nThis slope indicates that between these 4 tasks, younger \nadults had greater BOLD signal change than older adults \nin these brain areas. Notably,\nthere is a lack of difference in between-task BOLD activity \nwithin primary\nsensory areas such as vision between older and younger adults, \neven though several studies have reported older adults \nhaving less activity than younger\nadults in sensory areas \n[ \u2013 ]. \n\nWhen the Peiffer plot was explored for 3 contiguous\nvoxels with significantly negative slopes less than zero, \n19 total clusters were identified. Nine of these \nclusters (47%) were located within the right\nmiddle and superior frontal gyri and included a total of \n68\u2009voxels (see  ). \nAcross these clusters older adults showed BOLD deactivation on \ntasks when younger adults tended to slightly activate and \nolder adults had BOLD activation\nwhen younger adults were deactivating on a task \n(average slope \u22121.89 +/\u2212 0.21).\nThese areas appear to be activating in opposition between \nthe age groups and\nare contiguous to the right middle frontal gyrus area \n(cluster no. 4) identified\nin the \u201cresidual\u201d analysis. \nOther clusters, showing similar activity\ndifferences were seen within left medial frontal gyrus \n(2 clusters; 6\u2009voxels);\nleft inferior parietal lobule (3 clusters; 10\u2009voxels); \ncingulate gyrus (2 clusters; 7\u2009voxels); \nand single clusters within the basal ganglia (5\u2009voxels),\nmidbrain (3\u2009voxels), and the left posterior \nlobe of the cerebellum (7\u2009voxels).\nIt is important to note, however, that these findings, \nunlike those from the \u201cresidual\u201d\nanalysis above, have not been stringently controlled for \nmultiple comparisons\naside from retaining the requirement for 3 contiguous voxels. \n\nTo assess whether these slope findings were dependent \non age and not an epiphenomenon of the\ndatasets, a randomization of the age groups was \nperformed within each dataset.\nIndividuals were randomized in two groups so that the average \nage of both\ngroups was roughly equal (  \u223c  51 years of age). \nWhen the Peiffer plot was\nconstructed for these new groups, no significant clusters were \nidentified where\nthe null hypothesis (H  :  ) \nwas false. Additonally, no significant\nareas were identified where the slope was \u22121. \nThese findings thus support the\nclaim that the results of the original plot \nwere not due to the dataset\ncomposition (i.e., scanner, site, or paradigm) \nbut were dependent on separating\nthe study populations by age. \n\nAssessment of\nthe b-intercept indicated that the lack of significant \nslopes within the\nprimary sensory areas may be due to a baseline shift in activity \nbetween the\nage groups (see  ). \nFor example, within visual cortex, several areas were\nidentified that had negative b-intercepts which \nindicated that across the tasks\nolder adults tended to start from a lower BOLD \nactivity level than young adults\n(if  , then \n  negative BOLD signal). \nThis result is a continual within-task\ndifference, which is also seen in the published literature \n[ \u2013 ]; however, since this reduced\nBOLD signal in older adults is constant across several tasks, \nit does not have\na slope which deviates significantly from 1. \nIn addition, an area within right\nmotor cortex shows a positive b-intercept and thus greater \nactivity in older\nadults relative to younger adults. \nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous\nreviewer, this result is consistent with the model hypothesis \nof hemispheric asymmetry\nin older adults (HAROLD). \nThe HAROLD model states that there is reduced\nlateralization of brain activity in older adults \nrelative to younger adults,\nwhich results from changes in neural architecture \nand not cognitive strategy \n[ , \n ]. Due to the small number of\ndata points used to construct these plots, \nthe area included within the 95% confidence\ninterval of the b-intercept is relatively large. \nTherefore, these early\nfindings may underestimate the amount of brain activity \nwhich could be\ndescribed as being affected by an age-related \nDC-shift and is thus an\nage-related BOLD signal difference that is independent of task. \n\nFinally, an epiphenomenon of the method was \nrevealed when evaluating the goodness of fit,\nas measured by the R-squared value. \nAreas where the slope was similar to one\nshowed very high R-squared values (>0.8) \nsuggesting a high predictability\nfor older adults' BOLD signal in several \nbrain regions; however, within the\nclusters identified as significantly deviant \nfrom one, R-squared values were\nlower and ranged between 0.1\u20130.46. \n\n\n## 4. DISCUSSION \n  \nHere we report the preliminary use of a \nnovel meta-analysis technique in studies on\naging, which localizes one factor of general \ncognitive slowing to the\nsensorimotor transfer. These findings lend support to \nexisting data from\nevent-related potential work indicating that \nslowing occurs predominately\nduring the time for generation of the response in older \nadults and not when evaluating\nincoming sensory material \n[ , \n ]. Deviant slopes could be\nfound in between-task BOLD activity values where younger \nadults have greater\nBOLD activity change than older adults in the \nsensorimotor transfer area in the\nleft hemisphere. Additionally, right frontal \nareas were identified with slopes\nnear \u22121, indicating that older and younger \nadults were activating these\nattentional areas in opposite directions across the tasks. \nNot surprisingly,\nmore attentionally demanding tasks have shown \nthat older adults have\ndifferential patterns of activation within the \nfrontal cortex in response to the\ntask when compared to younger participants \n[ , \n ]. \n\nAn important caveat exists, however, \nsince datasets within this analysis were obtained from\nrelatively noncognitively demanding tasks. \nIn other words, more brain areas\nmay be involved as loci of general cognitive \nslowing and would emerge as more\ncognitively demanding datasets become available for assessment. \nComparing our\ncurrent datasets to the existing literature on Brinley plots of \nreaction times,\nsimple discrimination tasks show the least amount of response \ntime slowing;\ntherefore, these BOLD signal findings presumably will only \nbecome stronger with\nthe addition of datasets containing more cognitively demanding \nconditions\n(e.g., working memory). In addition, with more tasks requiring \ngreater attentional demand, the negative slope found within right \nfrontal cortex may\nsteepen and be found within the residual analysis which \ncan control for the\nmultiple comparisons inherent within imaging data. \nPower analyses of these\npreliminary results suggest that roughly 9 datasets are needed to \nperform a meta-analysis with a paired t-test to achieve a \npower-level of 80%. \n\nInterestingly, all\nsignificant clusters identified as deviant within the \nmeta-analysis were\nseparate from peak activity differences reported in any of the \nindividual tasks\nused within the datasets. \nIf traditional meta-analysis techniques were used \n[ \u2013 ], none of these areas would\nhave been found. Utilizing this novel meta-analysis technique, \nit is possible\nto assess between-task differences in BOLD activity between \ngroups regardless\nof paradigm design, task parameters, and location of the scan. \nWhile global\nsignal correction was used to normalize \nthe datasets within this study, the\nassessment method could also be performed using \naverage group z-maps that would\nallow datasets from multiple fMRI processing software \npackages to be analyzed\ncollectively. Additionally, this method may yield \ninteresting findings in a\nvariety of study groups where a clear \u201cnormal\u201d \ngroup can be identified and used\non the  -axis \n(e.g., schizophrenics versus normals; \ndyslexics versus normals; AD versus\nnormal older adults). It is important to keep in mind that \nthe use of this\nmethod is to determine between-task differences among \ntwo populations and not\nto differentiate the two groups within any one paradigm \nof the analysis. Thus,\ndifferences in whether or not an area is \nidentified as deviant come from how\nthe BOLD signal responds across a wide array of tasks. \n\nAn existing disadvantage of this meta-analysis technique \nis that it requires access to raw\nfMRI data to obtain subjects' normalized contrast \nweighted BOLD activity maps\n(task - baseline) from multiple tasks. With the\ncontinued increase of complete data sets maintained in \naccessible repositories\nlike the fMRI Data Center, this should\nhopefully become less burdensome in the near future. \n\nOverall as a meta-analysis method in the fMRI field, \nthis plotting addresses several\nlimitations of existing analysis methods. \nSpecifically, it allows the\nassessment of between-task differences regardless of a \ntask's paradigm domain\nor baseline condition. Further, it can identify \nareas of subthreshold effects\nin addition to the suprathreshold \nwithin-task differences that are identified\nby performing a meta-analysis on voxel quadrants \nidentified in individual\nstudies as the local maxima. Lastly, this method \nprovides imaging researchers\nthe ability to localize between-task differences \nin BOLD signal and apply that\nknowledge to existing behavioral evidence not only in aging but \nin other complex conditions \n(e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, etc.)\nas well. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 2233772, "text_md5": "722823d3667bf43d22773b8a72ef9730", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 83], "publication_year": [85, 89], "title": [100, 206], "keywords": [220, 220], "abstract": [233, 1277], "body": [1286, 21924]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 18274664, "doi": "10.1155/2008/167078", "pmcid": "2233772", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233772", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2233772"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233772\">2233772</a>", "list_title": "PMC2233772  Resurrecting Brinley Plots for a Novel Use: Meta-Analyses of Functional Brain Imaging Data in Older Adults"}

Recent brain imaging studies suggest abnormal brain activity underlying psychopathic behavior. No reliable pattern of altered neural activity has been disclosed so far. This study sought to identify consistent changes of brain activity in psychopaths and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. First, we used activation likelihood estimation (p < 0.05, corrected) to meta-analyze brain activation changes associated with psychopathy across 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reporting 753 foci from 155 experiments. Second, we characterized the ensuing regions functionally by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database (p < 0.05, corrected). Psychopathy was consistently associated with decreased brain activity in the right laterobasal amygdala, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilaterally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. A robust increase of activity was observed in the fronto-insular cortex on both hemispheres. Data-driven functional characterization revealed associations with semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal and fronto-insular cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal and left fronto-insular), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional as well as cognitive reward processing (right amygdala and fronto-insular cortex). Aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy is located in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. Physiological mental functions fulfilled by these brain regions correspond to disturbed behavioral patterns pathognomonic for psychopathy. Hence, aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n Psychopathy   is a term derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (soul) and \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (suffering). The term has undergone several shifts of meaning in the history of psychiatry. While it was originally associated with the notion of organic inferiority , Kurt Schneider (1923) used it as an umbrella term for what we would call personality disorders nowadays . Among the variants of psychopathy (i.e., personality disorder) that Kurt Schneider described, the type of the   affectionless psychopath   came closest to our current use of the term. Less than two decades after Schneider, American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley (1941) published his most influential monograph,   The Mask of Sanity  . In this book, Cleckley not only provided rich case descriptions but also a clinical profile of criteria that psychopaths would fulfill. Among these criteria were pathological egocentrism, the inability to love others, deceitfulness, and a lack of remorse or shame. Both Kurt Schneider (1923) and Hervey Cleckley (1941) emphasized the importance of callousness and the lack of emotional resonance as pathognomonic symptoms of the disorder.  Others also emphasized that social negativism is the most elementary datum of psychopathy . \n\nIn contrast to antisocial (or dissocial) personality disorder according to the American Psychiatric Association (2013) and the World Health Organization (1992) , the distinguishing hallmarks of psychopathy are a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold interpersonal style . While most psychopaths can meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, most individuals with antisocial personality disorder do not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Psychopathy is of high public concern due to its association with violence and offense recidivism.  Although psychopathy is considered a relatively rare phenomenon (with the prevalence estimated at about 1% of the general population ), psychopaths commit a disproportionate amount of crime , especially of violent offenses. The odds of violent re-offending are more than twice as high in psychopathic offenders as in non-psychopathic offenders. \n\nIn the recent past, neuroimaging studies have sought to identify brain abnormalities underlying psychopathy.  However, a considerable variability in results across studies has been pointed out, which may be due to differences in design (e.g., active vs. passive tasks), analysis (e.g., group comparisons vs. correlational analyses), and sample sizes.  Furthermore, differences in measurement of psychopathy (e.g., clinical vs. self-report; different cutoff thresholds) and sample demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, incarcerated vs. non-incarcerated) might introduce inhomogeneity. Given this heterogeneity of neuroimaging results, it has been deemed \u201cpremature to interpret certain findings as support for any particular theoretical viewpoint\u201d regarding affected neural circuits.  Put differently, it still remains an open question whether psychopathy is based on a robust organic substrate or merely reflects a variant of bad character traits. A summary of the extant imaging data is urgently needed to identify potential neural correlates of psychopathy. For an objective assessment of inter-study concordance, automated meta-analyses that quantify the level of concordance and allow identification of brain regions associated with significant convergence in a testable manner are preferable. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), firstly described by Turkeltaub et al. (2002) and subsequently refined , meets these demands and represents the most widely accepted approach for such quantitative integration of neuroimaging findings. Here, we used ALE to locate abnormal brain activity associated with psychopathy. \n\nThe mere localization of aberrant brain activity leaves unclear, however, whether functional brain alterations can account for pertinent psychopathology in psychopaths. To remove this ambiguity, we furthermore statistically assessed the physiological mental functions of the regions where we found convergence of altered brain activity associated with psychopathy. That is, we did not refer to previous assumptions in the literature on the putative psychological functions of the respective approximate brain regions. We rather statistically linked psychological functions to the exact clusters revealed by our meta-analysis by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. This combination of functional localization and characterization allows for observer-independent linking of pathophysiology to psychopathology. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \n#### Data selection \n  \nA principled procedure to identify the relevant experimental studies was used. First, we selected studies through a standard search in the PubMed ( ) and ISI Web of Science ( ) databases using the terms \u2018psychopathy\u2019 or \u2018psychopathic\u2019 in combination with \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018functional MRI\u2019, \u2018functional magnetic resonance\u2019, \u2018PET\u2019, \u2018positron emission\u2019, \u2018ASL\u2019, \u2018arterial spin labeling\u2019, \u2018MEG\u2019, \u2018magnetoencephalography\u2019, \u2018neuroimaging\u2019, or \u2018imaging\u2019. Second, further studies were found by means of the \u2018related articles\u2019 function of the PubMed database and by tracing the references from the identified papers and review articles. Task-based neuroimaging experiments were considered relevant when they reported either (1) direct group comparisons between psychopathic und non-psychopathic subjects or (2) correlations of brain activity with an established measure of psychopathy (e.g., the revised Psychopathy Checklist [PCL-R] ). Both approaches are valid to operationalize alterations in brain activity associated with psychopathy because psychopathy can be conceptualized categorically as well as dimensionally . Importantly, both approaches included in our meta-analysis related psychopathy to established measures of this disorder. Additionally, only experiments reporting results of whole-brain group analyses with coordinates referring to a standard reference space (Talairach-Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) were included. Results of region-of-interest analyses and studies not reporting stereotaxic coordinates were excluded. \n\nOn the basis of these search criteria, 28 papers were found to be eligible for inclusion into the meta-analyses ( ). Only functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) but no positron emission tomography (PET), arterial spin labeling (ASL) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies fulfilled our search criteria. Together, these papers reported 753 foci obtained from 155 experiments (with \u201cexperiment\u201d referring to an individual contrast reported in this paper; cf.,  ). The count of these foci was composed of 150 activations from 38 direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and 95 foci of positive correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 43 analyses as well as 234 deactivations from 37 direct group comparisons (psychopaths < non-psychopaths) and 274 foci of negative correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 37 analyses. Differences in coordinate spaces (Talairach vs. MNI space) were accounted for by transforming coordinates reported in Talairach space into MNI coordinates using a linear transformation . \n\nFirst, convergence of all reported foci was analyzed for the main effect of aberrant brain activity in psychopaths (155 experiments, 753 foci). Furthermore, we assessed convergence of reported activation foci indicating increased brain activity in psychopaths by pooling direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and positive correlational analyses (81 experiments, 245 foci). In an analogous manner (i.e., by pooling group comparisons and correlational analyses), we tested for convergence of reported deactivation foci (74 experiments, 508 foci). The denoted sample sizes, i.e., numbers of experiments, have been shown to be sufficient to achieve robust meta-analytic estimates . \n\n\n#### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using the revised ALE algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging results . This algorithm aims to identify areas with a convergence of reported coordinates across experiments that is higher than expected from a random spatial association. Reported foci are treated as centers of 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus.  Here, the between-subject variance is weighted by the number of participants per study, since larger sample sizes should provide more reliable approximations of the \u201ctrue\u201d activation effect and should therefore be modeled by more \u201cnarrow\u201d Gaussian distributions. \n\nSubsequently, probabilities of all foci reported of a given experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation (MA) map ( ).  Notably, foci were organized by subject group, which prevents multiple foci from a single experiment from cumulatively influencing MA values.  This approach hence prevents multiple experiments performed by one subject group from cumulatively influencing ALE values. It can thus be excluded that effects are amplified by non-orthogonal contrasts (i.e., from the same study) being submitted to the same analysis. Voxelwise ALE scores (union across these MA maps) then quantified the convergence across experiments at each location in the brain. To distinguish \u201ctrue\u201d from random convergence, ALE scores were compared to an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association among all MA maps. The resulting random-effects inference focuses on the above-chance convergence across studies rather than the clustering within a particular study.  This null hypothesis was derived by computing the distribution that would be obtained when sampling a voxel at random from each of the MA maps and taking the union of these values in the same manner as for the (spatially contingent) voxels in the original analysis.  The p-value of a \u201ctrue\u201d ALE score was then given by the proportion of equal or higher values obtained under the null distribution. The resulting nonparametric p-values were then assessed using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE ) to correct for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) and transformed into z scores for display . \n\nFor anatomical labeling, we capitalized on cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain provided by the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) Anatomy Toolbox . Clusters were thus assigned to the most probable histologically defined area at the respective location. This probabilistic histology-based anatomical labeling is reported in the results tables. References to details regarding cytoarchitecture are given in the table notes. \n\n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nFunctional characterization intends to link topographically defined brain regions with corresponding psychological processes by testing which kind of experiments are most likely to activate a given region. To functionally characterize regions exhibiting aberrant activity related to psychopathy (i.e., the regions revealed by our meta-analysis; cf.  ), we made use of the BrainMap database ( ) that currently contains \u2248 7,500 experiments in healthy subjects (experiments investigating age, gender, disease, or drug effects excluded). BrainMap meta-data provide information on behavioral domain and paradigm class of each neuroimaging experiment included in the database. Behavioral domains describe the mental processes isolated by the statistical contrasts  and comprise the main categories action, cognition, emotion, interoception, perception, as well as their subcategories. Paradigm classes specify the task employed in the corresponding neuroimaging studies (see   for the complete BrainMap taxonomy). To describe the functional roles of the candidate regions, we used a reverse inference approach, which tests the probability of a mental process being present, given knowledge that a particular brain region is activated.  More precisely, the functional profile of a region was determined by over-representation of mental processes (i.e., behavioral domains and paradigm classes) in the experiments activating the respective cluster relative to the entire BrainMap database using a binomial test.  The significance threshold was set to p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). To draw a more differentiated picture and complement this view by providing additional information on weaker associations, we also report both forward inference (probability of observing activity in a brain region given knowledge of the psychological process) and reverse inference (probability of a psychological process being present given knowledge of activation in a particular brain region) at a more liberal threshold (p < 0.05, uncorrected) in the supplement. This approach provides an objective and quantitative attribution of mental functions to brain regions in contrast to commonly used qualitative and subjective interpretation of activation foci in neuroimaging. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nAcross 155 experiments, convergence of aberrant brain activity in psychopathy was observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex on both hemispheres, in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in the fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum, and in the laterobasal subdivision of the right amygdala ( ;  ). The follow-up analysis of   increased   neural activity associated with psychopathy indicated convergence in the left and right fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum ( ). In contrast, convergence of   decreased   brain activity in psychopathy was located in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex, and the right laterobasal amygdala ( ). Taken together, the follow-up analyses were able to unambiguously classify each malfunctioning region as showing either increased or decreased activity. That is, our analyses did not identify any region that was not selectively hyper- or hypoactivated. Contribution analyses did not suggest a specific stimulus or task characteristic to critically drive the effects. It can thus not be inferred that certain kinds of design lead to differences in a particular region. \n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nTo obtain an objective description of the tasks recruiting regions that feature aberrant activity associated with psychopathy and thus provide a link to the psychopathology of psychopathy, we conducted a functional characterization of the regions that were found in our meta-analysis. Hereby, psychological terms were related to the respective region as registered in the BrainMap database, i.e., on basis of functional experiments in healthy subjects ( ;  ). \n\nThe right lateral prefrontal cortex was significantly associated with action execution and at the more liberal threshold also with pain perception. In contrast, the left lateral prefrontal cluster was significantly associated with phonological (and semantic) language processing. At the relaxed threshold, also the dorsomedial prefrontal region was related to semantic language processing but was most robustly linked to social cognition. A significant above-chance association with the emotional domain was found for the laterobasal amygdala cluster. Lowering the statistical threshold specified an association with reward processing within the emotional domain. In an analogous manner, the right fronto-insular cluster related to reward processing, however, within the cognitive domain. The functional profile of the left fronto-insular cluster, in contrast, resembled that of the left lateral prefrontal cortex with a focus on language/speech processing, including delayed matching-to-sample tasks, as well as in addition pain processing. \n\nTaken together, we found decreased activity in regions associated with action control, semantic language processing, pain processing, social cognition, and emotional reward. Increased activity was observed in regions involved in cognitive reward and also in semantic language and pain processing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study sought to identify robust alterations of brain activity associated with psychopathy and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. To this end, we combined meta-analyses of whole-brain neuroimaging studies of psychopathy with functional characterization of the obtained regions using meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. Our meta-analysis revealed aberrant brain activity associated with psychopathy converging in frontal, insular, and limbic regions. Post-hoc analyses in combination with data-driven functional characterization indicated decreased activity in regions crucial for semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal cortex), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional reward processing (right amygdala). In contrast, increased activity was located in a region for cognitive reward processing (right fronto-insular cortex) and another region associated with semantic language and pain processing (left fronto-insular cortex). \n\nThe observation of altered activity in two regions that were associated with semantic language processing fits well with previous evidence from psychological experiments showing abnormal processing of semantic and affective verbal information including vocal affect recognition in psychopathy . In this context, dysfunctional affect-language interactions have been proposed in psychopaths (\u201cThey know the words, but not the music\u201d).  The concomitance of increased and decreased activity in two nearby regions involved in semantic verbal processing (left fronto-insular and lateral prefrontal cortex) might seem confusing   prima facie   but reflect an imbalance of closely related brain networks as recently observed in affective disorders . \n\nAberrant (i.e., decreased) activity converged in a cluster within the right lateral prefrontal cortex that turned out to be associated with action execution. This finding might represent the neural correlate of impaired action control in psychopathy . This interpretation is supported by electroencephalographic data suggesting that poor response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits is predicated on reduced frontal function . In addition, the improvement of weak response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits after non-invasive electrical stimulation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex seems to confirm the supposed association . At a liberal threshold, this cluster as well as the cluster in the left fronto-insular cortex were also related to pain processing according to our functional characterization. Although caution is warranted, this result matches evidence suggesting psychopathy is linked to altered perception and tolerance as well as empathy of pain . \n\nThe dorsomedial prefrontal cortical region, where we found decreased activity, was significantly associated with social cognition, which includes empathy, morality, and theory of mind. A previous meta-analysis of the neural correlates of moral cognition in healthy subjects showed that the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is consistently involved in all these three subdomains.  Moreover, our meta-analytic finding likely constitutes the neural basis of sociopathy or being affectionless (in Kurt Schneider\u2019s sense) as the core trait of psychopathy implying lack of empathy and remorse. The dysfunction of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex may result from or in altered functional connectivity of this region, which has been reported elsewhere and is most likely based on its reduction in gray matter . \n\nFinally, our analyses demonstrated consistently decreased activity in a laterobasal region of the amygdala that related to emotional reward processing, but increased activity in a brain region associated with cognitive reward processing, namely the right fronto-insular cortex. This down-regulation of affective in favor of cognitive brain regions may underlie pathognomonic shallow affect in psychopathy. Consistent with this notion, it has been noted that callous-unemotional traits are behavioral sequelae of deficient amygdala responsiveness . Also here, the imbalance of affective vs. cognitive regions might rest upon aberrant functional connectivity in the context of gray matter reduction in psychopathy . \n\nSo far, no consistent pattern of structural brain alterations in psychopathy has been identified. However, evidence of gray matter thinning in lateral and medial prefrontal as well as in temporal cortical regions suggests a link between structural perturbations and aberrant activity in these regions that we identified in this meta-analysis.  These morphological changes may be associated with certain psychopathic traits and in particular be evident in so-called unsuccessful psychopaths , i.e., individuals whose rule-breaking and dissocial behavior has led to legal action or punishment. \n\nA limitation of this meta-analyis (but meta-analyses in general) is that not all available functional imaging studies on psychopathy fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The exclusion of studies restricting their analyses to a limited numbers of regions (i.e., region-of-interest approaches) may explain why our meta-analysis did not locate reliably altered activity in regions that one would have expected from the literature, e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex. However, it did confirm abnormalities in other notorious regions implicated in psychopathy such as the amygdala. Both regions are part of a \u201cparalimbic system\u201d that has been proposed to be dysfunctional in psychopathy by Kiehl and colleagues  and i.a. includes the insula, which also emerged in our meta-analysis. In short, our analyses corroborate the paralimbic system dysfunction model of psychopathy, if not with respect to every implicated region. Another model of psychopathy by Blair and colleagues proposed a deficit in the so-called violence inhibition mechanism, which normally leads to a withdrawal reaction of the aggressor when another individual shows signs of distress.  Proper functioning of this mechanism has been assumed to be a prerequisite for moral and empathic social behavior.  The meta-analytic finding of altered activity in a region for cognitive control (right lateral prefrontal cortex) and moral cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) might be regarded as neurobiological underpinning of this neurocognitive model of psychopathy. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the functional characterization of the regions that we found in our meta-analysis matches well with aberrant behavioral patterns observed in psychopaths. However, it has to be kept in mind that the putatively underlying neuropsychological deficits might reflect overall alterations, whereas the neural alterations might be rather specific to a particular construct. Alternatively, the neuropsychological deficits might reflect specific alterations, while the neural differences might be rather generic effects in polymodal regions of the cortex.  We would thus argue that the decoding findings suggest specific avenues to test the dominant neurobiological accounts of psychopathy. \n\nIn summary, our analyses robustly pinpoint aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. These regions may serve as targets for pharmacological interventions or brain stimulation techniques. Their alterations in activity may be based on structural brain changes. The finding of aberrant activity in both limbic and prefrontal regions may reconcile Kiehl\u2019s paralimbic dysfunction hypothesis  with Blair\u2019s violence-inhibition-mechanism-deficit theory . Furthermore, our results objectively illustrate that the (physiological) mental functions fulfilled by the respective brain regions correspond with the deviant behavioral patterns that are characteristic of psychopathy. In other words, the results show that aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6344321, "text_md5": "e8df378a7fd8e5a62581622f4e795353", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 183], "journal": [184, 199], "publication_year": [201, 205], "title": [216, 305], "keywords": [319, 319], "abstract": [332, 2188], "body": [2197, 26517]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30038232, "doi": "10.1038/s41380-018-0122-5", "pmcid": "6344321", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344321", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6344321"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344321\">6344321</a>", "list_title": "PMC6344321  A View Behind the Mask of Sanity: Meta-Analysis of Aberrant Brain Activity in Psychopaths"}

We undertook a systematic meta\u2010analysis of data from task\u2010fMRI studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case\u2010control differences on brain activation. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case\u2010control differences derived from 537 task\u2010fMRI studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. The fMRI tasks were classified according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC).

When considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of RDoC domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole\u2010brain studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or RDoC domain or construct.

Hum Brain Mapp 38:1846\u20131864, 2017  . \u00a9   2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in psychiatric neuroimaging because of its excellent safety profile, high patient acceptability, good spatial resolution and acceptable temporal resolution. To date, the majority of fMRI studies have examined the spatial distribution and level of blood oxygenation\u2010level dependent (BOLD) signal associated with performance of different tasks. The ultimate aim of this line of research is the identification of abnormalities in task\u2010related neural activity that are associated with a specific psychiatric disorder or symptom dimension. Much of the recent scientific impetus for task\u2010fMRI studies in psychiatry can be attributed to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project [Cuthbert,  ; Insel et al.,  ; Sanislow et al.,  ]. The RDoC project posits that psychiatric diagnoses result from disruption in brain circuits that underpin domains of mental function which are important for adaptive behavior. These comprise circuits associated with reward (positive valence systems), threat sensitivity (negative valence systems), cognitive processes, interpersonal interactions (social processes), and biological activation (arousal and regulation) [Sanislow et al.,  ]. In this scheme, task\u2010fMRI is an important tool in mapping mental processes to neural circuits. Case\u2010control differences in task\u2010related brain activity are then used to make inferences about abnormalities in domain circuits relating to disease processes. \n\nThe literature on task\u2010fMRI in psychiatric disorders is extensive and lends itself to quantitative synthesis of the findings from the primary studies. Neuroimaging studies typically report the locations of peak statistical effects using anatomical coordinates referenced to a stereotactic system, most commonly the Talairach [Talairach and Tournoux,  ] or the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space [Evans et al.,  ]. Because of this reporting convention, quantitative synthesis of task\u2010fMRI data utilizes coordinate\u2010based analyses that are concerned with the consistency and specificity of the spatial convergence of the results of the primary studies [Fox et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ]. To date, the task\u2010fMRI literature has been synthesized in multiple coordinate\u2010based meta\u2010analyses that have mainly focused on a single psychiatric disorder [e.g., Chen et al.  ; Crossley et al.,  ; Del Casale et al.,  ; Gentili et al.,  ; Graham et al.,  ; Ipser et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ; Minzenberg et al.,  ]. The few meta\u2010analyses that have compared two or more disorders suggest commonalities in the patterns of fMRI activation that transcend current nosological categorizations [e.g., Delvecchio et al.,  ; Etkin and Wager,  ]. Evidence of trans\u2010diagnostic overlap has also been reported in brain structural [e.g., Arnone et al.,  ; Goodkind et al.,  ; Kempton et al.,  ] and in genetic studies [e.g., Cross\u2010Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,  ; Network and Pathway Analysis Subgroup of Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,  ]. This has led to proposals that psychiatric disorders may arise from perturbations in the functional and structural organization of common large\u2010scale brain networks [Menon,  ]. It is, therefore, timely to interrogate the task\u2010fMRI literature to characterize the spatial pattern of case\u2010control differences in brain activation across multiple RDoC domains and psychiatric diagnoses. \n\nGiven the size and complexity of the relevant literature, we chose to focus on task\u2010fMRI data comparing healthy adults to adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). These psychiatric conditions are particularly amenable to joint examination because they are often comorbid at syndromal level and show significant overlap at the level of symptom dimensions [Buckley et al.,  ; DeVylder et al.,  ; Gorun et al.,  ; Kessler et al.,  ; Markon  ; Vaidyanathan et al.,  ]. We therefore conducted a quantitative analysis of neuroimaging studies of these disorders and mapped peak coordinates of case\u2010control differences in regional brain activation to predefined cortical and subcortical regions within a canonical atlas space. We classified each task according to its corresponding RDoC domain and construct. The coordinates of each case\u2010control difference were then coded according to the corresponding RDoC domain and contrast, the diagnosis of the patient group in the primary study, the level of inference (region of interest or whole\u2010brain) and the direction of signal change (hypoactivation or hyperactivation in patients compared to healthy participants). The main aims of the analysis were to test for diagnostic specificity of the reported case\u2010control differences and to investigate whether any diagnostic specificity (if present) could be attributed to dysfunction within RDoC\u2010specified circuits. The issue of specificity is of primary concern particularly in task\u2010fMRI studies where there is often a tendency \u201cto reason backward from patterns of activation to infer the engagement of specific mental processes\u201d [Poldrack,  ,  ] and by extension to infer abnormalities of specific mental processes in relation to different disorders [Paulus,  ]. Addressing the issue of specificity in connection to task\u2010fMRI is a fundamental first step in moving the field forward conceptually and in identifying new directions for methodological refinement and improvement. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature Search and Study Selection \n  \nWe included original, peer\u2010reviewed fMRI studies that compared healthy adults (age range 18\u201365 years) to adult patients with SCZ, BD, MDD, OCD, or Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorders, Panic Disorder, Post\u2010Traumatic Stress Disorder, Specific Phobias and Social Anxiety Disorder) and reported case\u2010control differences in stereotactic space. Among anxiety disorders, we examined only those for which we could identify a minimum of seven primary studies. This was not a consideration for the other diagnostic categories where the literature was more extensive. We excluded case reports, case series, reviews, studies that combined patients with different diagnoses into a single group and duplicate citations. We interrogated databases available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information up to December 2013 using relevant expanded subject headings and free text searches. A total of 12,037 unique publications were examined and 537 were included in the analyses based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses Statement (PRISMA;  /). PRISMA diagrams and full citations of the studies included are available in Supporting Information Methods 1 and 2a\u2010e. Supporting Information Figure S1 shows the number of studies and their mean sample size per year of publication. \n\n\n### Database Construction \n  \nThe following were recorded from each study separately for patient and control groups: number of participants, age [mean and standard deviation (SD)], sex (% male), diagnostic classification system (e.g., DSM\u2010IV), and diagnostic ascertainment (i.e., structured interview or clinical assessment). The following were recorded, when available, from each study for each patient group: current and lifetime comorbidity with alcohol or substance abuse/dependence, medication status (% receiving any psychotropic medication), and medication type (% atypical antipsychotics, % typical antipsychotics, % antidepressants, % anticonvulsants and % lithium). For each study, we recorded the year of publication, the field strength of the MRI scanner, the activation paradigm used during fMRI data acquisition, the direction of activation changes in patients compared to healthy individuals for each contrast and the level of inference (region of interest, small\u2010volume correction, and whole\u2010brain). For brevity, the term ROI will be used hereafter to denote both region\u2010of\u2010interest and small\u2010volume correction analyses. We followed the RDoC project in classifying fMRI paradigms according to RDoC domains and constructs. The number of studies included per diagnosis, level of inference and RDoC domain and demographic details of the samples are shown in Tables   and  . Details of the study samples, tasks and task\u2010contrasts used can be found in Supporting Information Methods 3. \n  \nOverview of database structure \n      \nDemographic information \n    \n\n### Quantification of Studies Per Anatomical Region \n  \nWe extracted the coordinates of the anatomical locations of the peak statistical effects for case\u2010control differences from each primary study. Following the general convention in meta\u2010analyses, we accepted the results reported as significant in the primary studies. A small minority of primary studies used two fMRI tasks in which case we used the coordinates of the case\u2010control differences for each task. When both ROI and whole\u2010brain results were reported in the same study we only used the coordinates from the whole\u2010brain analyses. Coordinates were transformed to MNI, if reported in Talairach space, using the \u201ctal2icbm_fsl\u201d transform ( /). All coordinates were mapped to the Harvard\u2010Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases [Desikan et al.,  ; Frazier et al.,  ] ( ;  /), with a probability threshold of 10% for each region. This threshold accommodates uncertainty about region localization across individuals and studies and recognizes that activation clusters extend beyond the location of the peak coordinates. The number of unique primary studies reporting one or more coordinates within each region was calculated. Studies that reported two or more coordinates within the same anatomical region were only counted once. Study\u2010counts were summed across hemispheres for each region. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nIndependent variables of interest were diagnosis, level of inference (ROI or whole\u2010brain), RDoC domain, RDoC construct, and direction of signal change (hypoactivation or hyperactivation in patients compared to healthy participants). The dependent variable was number of unique studies implicating each Harvard\u2010Oxford cortical and subcortical atlas region. To test the effect of diagnosis, we created diagnosis\u2010by\u2010region cross\u2010tables and performed   \u03c7   tests with Yates' correction. The same approach was then used to investigate the effect of each of the other variables of interest. Then, we investigated the effect of the variables of interest separately for each atlas region using Fisher\u2010exact tests. We tested for the similarity of the anatomical distributions of results for each variable of interest using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients of the numbers of studies contributing to each atlas region. For example, to test whether studies of SCZ report similar results to BD, we calculated the correlation between the number of SCZ studies by atlas region to those of BD. \n\nWe performed Kruskal\u2010Wallis tests to compare the values of each continuous, quantitative demographic and clinical variable (sample size, age [mean and SD], % male, % of patients on medication and % on each medication type) between studies that reported an effect in each region and studies that did not. For discrete, categorical variables (substance abuse exclusion, scanner field strength) we performed chi\u2010square tests per region. \n\nTo meaningfully compare the distribution of studies across anatomical regions and diagnoses, study counts are represented as a percentage of the total number of studies for each diagnosis divided by the volume of the anatomical region, as larger brain regions would be statistically more likely to contain activation loci simply by virtue of their size. This yielded a score for each diagnosis, for each atlas region, quantified as the percentage of studies for the respective diagnosis, per cm  within the respective region. To test whether this score was randomly (i.e., normally) distributed across regions, we performed Kolmogorov Smirnov tests of the score distribution across all regions and across cortical regions and subcortical regions separately. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Anatomical Distribution of Results Depending on Inference Level \n  \nWhen all reported coordinates were considered together (regardless of whether the primary studies used a whole\u2010brain or ROI approach), case\u2010control differences in BOLD signal were reported in all atlas regions between 4 and 239 times as shown in Supporting Information Figure S2 and S3.Coordinates reported by ROI versus whole\u2010brain studies were not equally distributed across all atlas regions (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200999.59,   P  \u2009<\u200910 ). The same was observed when subcortical (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200925.13,   P  \u2009<\u200910 ) and cortical regions (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200964.07,   P   =0.04) were considered separately. When considering case\u2010control differences from studies using whole\u2010brain analyses only, a Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov test examining the distribution of number of studies per cm  was no longer significant (  D  \u2009=\u20090.10,   P  \u2009=\u20090.58), indicating that subcortical regions were not significantly overrepresented among whole\u2010brain studies alone. Following Fisher\u2010exact tests comparing each region to the total numbers of ROI and whole\u2010brain studies, 3 out of the 8 sub\u2010cortical regions and 16 out of the 48 cortical areas showed at least a nominal effect of level of inference (Table  ). Whole\u2010brain studies were significantly overrepresented among those studies contributing to the thalamus and the brain stem, whereas ROI studies have been chiefly responsible for results in the amygdala (Table  ). Regarding cortical regions, ROI studies tended to focus on frontal and temporal regions and less on parietal and occipital regions (Table  ). Nevertheless, the frequency of ROI and whole\u2010brain results correlated highly across regions (  \u03c1  \u2009=\u20090.78,   P  \u2009<\u200910 , adjusted for region volume). Regions that were significantly supported by ROI studies tended to be among the top regions showing case\u2010control differences even when considering whole\u2010brain studies alone. This lends indirect support to the a priori ROI selection. However, the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and the thalamus appear to be remarkably under\u2010selected among studies using ROI analyses despite the high frequency of case\u2010control differences in these regions at the whole\u2010brain level (Table  ). Among whole\u2010brain studies, the top 10 regions across all disorders (ranked by frequency of case\u2010control difference adjusted for region size) were the nucleus accumbens, anterior insula, posterior parahippocampal gyrus, globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, thalamus, paracingulate gyrus, and putamen (Fig.  ; Supporting Information Table S1). \n  \nThe top 10 regions among whole\u2010brain studies across all disorders (ranked by frequency of reported case\u2010control difference, adjusted for region size).

Pairwise contrasts of study\u2010counts across all regions yielded nominal results for the contrasts of SCZ and MDD (  P  \u2009=\u20090.01) and of SCZ and anxiety disorders (  P  \u2009=\u20090.05). The general lack of diagnostic specificity is also apparent in the Spearman's rank correlations (Table   and Supporting Information Tables 2 and 3), as for each pair of diagnoses, correlation coefficients across regions ranged between 0.42 and 0.82 and were highly significant (0.001\u2009<\u2009  P  \u2009<\u200910 ). When cortical and subcortical regions were examined separately, a significant effect of diagnosis on the anatomical distribution of reported locations of case\u2010control differences was found for subcortical (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200952.75,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003), but not cortical regions. This effect was driven by the amygdala (  P  \u2009=\u20090.01) and the caudate nucleus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.01; Table  ), but disappeared when considering only whole\u2010brain studies (Table  ). In contrast, among whole\u2010brain studies the only region that showed a nominally significant effect of diagnosis was the nucleus accumbens (  P  \u2009=\u20090.004). This effect was primarily driven by an increased frequency of results reported in the nucleus accumbens from OCD studies compared to SCZ (  P  \u2009=\u20090.017) and MDD (  P  \u2009=\u20090.004) studies. Considering each region separately, none of the 56 regions showed an effect of diagnosis that was significant under a Bonferroni\u2010corrected   \u03b1   of 0.05/56\u2009=\u20090.0009 (Tables   and  ). The inference\u2010dependence of the diagnostic effects is also illustrated in Figures  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . \n  \nPercentage of studies within each diagnostic category reporting one or more coordinates within each subcortical structure.

We show that the chi\u2010square test for the effect of diagnosis had 97% power to detect a modest effect size of   w  \u2009=\u20090.2 (df\u2009=\u2009220, alpha\u2009=\u20090.05, 2,267 observations, calculated using G*Power), and >99.99% power to detect a moderate effect size of   w  \u2009=\u20090.30, even when considering only whole\u2010brain studies. Next, we calculated the number of additional studies required to potentially change the current findings by simulating multiples of our cross\u2010tables in R. The effect size of diagnosis was Cramer's   V  \u2009=\u20090.11 when considering both region of interest and whole brain studies. Therefore 500 new studies would be required to detect a diagnostic difference at 80% power and alpha\u2009<\u20090.05. When considering only whole brain studies, 1,054 additional studies would be required to detect a significant effect of diagnosis, at 80% power and alpha <0.05. We conducted the same analyses at the level of brain regions. For a significant effect of diagnosis, given the observed effect sizes the number of studies required increased further. For example, for the amygdala and middle frontal gyrus, two regions that are commonly included in different disease models, we would require approximately double the size of the current database. A review of the literature as the meta\u2010analysis was conducted showed that 47 potentially eligible studies were published for SCZ and the numbers for the other conditions were substantially smaller. Therefore, inclusion of these studies would be unlikely to change the results. \n\n\n### Anatomical Distribution of Results Across RDoC Domains and Constructs \n  \nWhen all primary studies were considered together (irrespective of diagnosis), the choice of task, as classified by RDoC domains and constructs, had an effect on the location of case\u2010control differences in subcortical structures (domains:   \u03c7  \u2009=\u200966.71,   P  \u2009=\u20091.17 \u00d7 10 ; constructs:   \u03c7  \u2009= 130.79,   P  \u2009=\u20091.46 \u00d7 10 ; Fig.  ). Following Fisher exact tests per region, effects were significant for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (Table  ; all   P  \u2009\u2264\u20090.01). In the cortex, the overall effect was not significant (domains:   \u03c7  \u2009=\u2009156.4   P  \u2009=\u20090.10; constructs:   \u03c7  \u2009= 397.61,   P  \u2009=\u20090.78); only a nominally significant effect could be detected in the frontal medial cortex, frontal operculum and the anterior parahippocampal gyrus (Table  ; all   P  \u2009\u2264\u20090.01). However, after excluding ROI studies, no regions were significantly associated with RDoC domains, or constructs (Table  ; all   P  \u2009> 0.08). The frequency of the RDoC domains tested in the primary studies was significantly different across diagnoses (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200987.24;   P  \u2009<\u200910 , Table  ). Therefore, we tested whether classifying studies by RDoC domain may uncover diagnosis\u2010specific patterns of results. Fisher\u2010exact tests per region within each RDoC domain, however, did not yield any significant results beyond what could be expected by chance (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.01). \n  \nFor each region, the contribution of studies that used tasks engaging domains defined by the RDoC project is shown as a proportion of the total number of studies showing case\u2010control differences in that region. Regional distributions can be compared to the overall RDoC distribution shown in the bars on the right of each figure. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \n\n### Anatomical Distribution of Results Depending on Direction of Signal Change \n  \nAcross all studies, the pattern of \u201chyperactive\u201d and \u201chypoactive\u201d foci in patients compared to controls was highly correlated across all regions (  \u03c1  \u2009=\u20090.79,   P  \u2009<\u20092.2 \u00d7 10 ). Nevertheless, this effect was not distributed equally across all regions (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200998.51,   P  \u2009=\u20090.0001), cortical regions (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200965.93,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03), or subcortical regions (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200929.90,   P  \u2009<\u200910 ). The amygdala, planum polare, and the anterior part of the inferior temporal gyrus were significantly more likely to be \u201chyperactive\u201d in patients, whereas the putamen and nucleus accumbens more likely to be \u201chypoactive\u201d (Table  , Supporting Information Figure S4a and S4b). \n\n\n### Effect of Potential Moderating Demographic and Clinical Variables \n  \nThe following   P  \u2010values are Bonferroni\u2010corrected for number of regions tested, but not for number of moderator variables investigated to allow potentially meaningful moderator effects to be considered in future study designs. We found no evidence for an effect of medication status (medicated vs. unmedicated patients; all   P  \u2009>\u20090.14), medication type (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.99), study sample size (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.5), year of publication (  P  \u2009>\u20090.17), and mean age and SD (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.64) for any region. A significant effect of alcohol and substance abuse was found only for the angular gyrus (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200916.96;   P  \u2009=\u20090.01). Of the studies that included patients regardless of substance abuse status, 50% reported case\u2010control differences in this region compared to 23% of studies that excluded patients with a lifetime history of substance abuse, and compared to 14% of studies that excluded patients with both current and lifetime substance abuse. Studies that reported results in the frontal pole tended to include more female patients (  W  \u2009=\u200939,607;   P  \u2009=\u20090.04) and controls (  W  \u2009=\u200939,351;   P  \u2009=\u20090.06). Studies reporting results in the frontal medial cortex also included on average a higher proportion of female patients (  W  \u2009=\u200915,862,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03), but not controls. Finally, higher field\u2010strengths were more likely to contribute to results in the frontal pole (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u200921.84;   P  \u2009=\u20090.001). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study was motivated by the need to interrogate the large task\u2010fMRI literature for evidence of specificity between regional activation patterns and diagnosis for common psychiatric disorders. A further aim was to test whether any evidence of specificity could be accounted for by abnormalities in task\u2010related activations pertaining to mental function domains specified in the RDoC project. We also investigated which regions are most influenced, and possibly biased, by level of inference by comparing the results of ROI studies to data\u2010driven whole\u2010brain studies. Study results are based on the quantitative synthesis of task\u2010fMRI findings from 547 studies comprising observations derived from 21,692 participants. \n\n### Similarity in the Spatial Distribution of Task\u2010fMRI Foci of Case\u2010Control Differences Across Psychiatric Disorders \n  \nWe found nominal effects of diagnosis in several regions when considering both ROI and whole\u2010brain studies (Table  ); these results were driven by ROI studies alone and none survived Bonferroni\u2010corrected   P  \u2010values. Thus, great caution is required in attributing these subtle and potentially biased results as indicative of meaningful diagnosis\u2010specific effects. Rather, our results indicate that the anatomical distribution of case\u2010control fMRI studies are largely diagnostic\u2010general, as indicated by the high similarities between case\u2010control fMRI results across disorders (Figs.   and  \u22128, Table  , Supporting Information Tables S2 and S3). The similarity in the cortical regions implicated in MDD and anxiety disorders is particularly striking as shown in Figures   and  . \n\nIt is theoretically possible that misdiagnosis, medication, symptom profile or disease severity may have influenced the analyses of case\u2010control differences. Given the differences in these variables between diagnostic groups, we consider a systematic bias resulting in increased similarity between diagnoses to be implausible. For example, on average 92% of patients with SCZ were prescribed antipsychotics while this was the case for only 15% of patients with OCD. Therefore we consider alternate interpretation for the similarities in the spatial distribution of task\u2010fMRI case\u2010control differences. It is possible that the disorders examined here arise from largely overlapping neural network dysfunction. This observation is supported by a recent meta\u2010analysis of brain structural case\u2010control differences across multiple disorders that also failed to identify diagnosis\u2010specific effects [Goodkind et al.,  ]. A common biological substrate provides an explanation for the symptomatic overlap in the disorders examined here [Beesdo et al.,  ; Buckley et al.,  ; Eisen and Rasmussen,  ; Kim et al.,  ; OConghaile and DeLisi,  ; Pearlson,  ; Rosen et al.,  ]. The transdiagnostic overlap in brain activation abnormalities also resonates with behavioral observations of shared transdiagnostic cognitive deficits that are present at or before disease onset [Shanmugan et al.,  ; Koenen et al.,  ], and with transdiagnostic overlap of genetic risk factors [Cross\u2010disorder group of the PGC, 2013; Doherty and Owen,  ]. Thus, it appears that transdiagnostic overlap is consistently observed at multiple scales of enquiry involving genetic factors, symptoms, cognitive function, brain morphology, and brain activity. This encourages a cross\u2010diagnostic approach to the investigation of the biological underpinnings of mental disorders. However, there are significant differences in the relative prevalence of symptoms across the disorders examined here. For example, OCD symptoms may be present in about 18% of patients with SCZ [Kim et al.,  ] and psychotic experiences are reported by about 14% of patients with OCD [Eisen and Rasmussen,  ]. Our findings suggest that the relationship between abnormalities in task\u2010related networks to symptoms is both complex and unclear. This relationship has mostly been examined in SCZ where cognitive dysfunction shows no correlation with positive symptoms and only a moderate correlation with negative symptoms [Ventura et al.,  ,  ]. It is therefore likely that the abnormalities in brain networks and network\u2010regions we can observe with fMRI reflect disorder\u2010general conditions that facilitate the emergence and persistence of symptoms but are insufficient for explaining symptomatic variability across disorders. Task\u2010related fMRI cannot identify the nature of computations at the neuronal level; it can only detect the corresponding BOLD signal that suggest that such computations within neuronal assemblies. It is possible that the variability in the observed and reported symptoms across disorders is linked to the exact nature of neuronal computations which may not be detectable by the task\u2010related fMRI studies included in this meta\u2010analysis. \n\n\n### Regions Implicated Across Disorders \n  \nAlthough case\u2010control differences were widely distributed, the dorsal and ventral striatum, the amygdala and hippocampus and cortical regions within the frontal operculum/anterior insula, posterior parahippocampal gyrus and paracingulate gyrus were relatively overrepresented (Fig.  ). Meta\u2010analyses of anatomical MRI studies have confirmed the involvement of subcortical pathology in SCZ [van Erp et al.,  ], MDD [Schmaal et al.,  ] and BD [Hibar et al.,  ] while a meta\u2010analysis of brain volumetric studies identified cortical grey matter reductions in the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex as the most robust deficits across disorders [Goodkind,  ]. \n\nWe found some evidence for diagnostic specificity, supported by whole\u2010brain studies, regarding the nucleus accumbens: case\u2010control differences in this region were more frequently reported in OCD, particularly compared to MDD and SCZ. This observation does not imply that the nucleus accumbens is not involved in disorders other than OCD. Rather, it indicates the relative importance of the nucleus accumbens in OCD compared to other disorders, which is congruent with current neurocognitive theories of OCD that focus on cortico\u2010striatal\u2010thalamic loops [Graybiel and Rauch,  ; Milad and Rauch,  ]. The role of the nucleus accumbens in this framework lies in the integration of affective information with motor selection [Fineberg et al.,  ; Wood and Ahmari,  ]. However, given the difficulty of imaging a small structure like the nucleus accumbens with high confidence, studies that specifically focus on nucleus accumbens anatomy and function are necessary to verify and understand the present finding. \n\n\n### Similarity in the Spatial Distribution of Task\u2010fMRI Foci of Case\u2010Control Differences Across RDoC Domains and Constructs \n  \nThe results of our study suggest that tasks assigned to different RDoC domains or constructs result in a similar neuroanatomical distribution of case\u2010control differences. The RDoC framework specifies different mental processes that are grouped together under distinct domains which are assumed to map on discrete neural circuits. However, the degree to which mental processes engage specific, common or partially overlapping regions remains a topic of debate [Pessoa,  ; Price and Friston,  ]. In fMRI experiments, multiple brain areas are co\u2010activated during a given task; conversely a single brain area may be activated by disparate tasks that may not always share cognitive components [Price and Friston,  ]. The relationship between brain structure and function has been described both as pluripotent (one\u2010to\u2010many) and degenerate (many\u2010to\u2010one). Price and Friston [ ] argue that although brain regions are engaged by multiple dissimilar processes, there is a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d that encapsulates the core functionality of each region. Conversely, given the pluripotent nature of brain organization, such common denominator labels can be attributed to multiple brain regions that are bound to overlap significantly with brain regions defined by other \u201ccommon denominator\u201d labels. Our data suggest that RDoC domains and constructs operate at the level of \u201ccommon denominator\u201d labels which could account for the similarity in the spatial pattern of case\u2010control differences across the diagnoses examined. Alternatively, our results may reflect the fact that standard univariate MRI analyses may not be ideally suited for the examination of brain structure\u2010function relationships relevant to disease processes as they do not provide information about the interactions between the brain regions engaged during a task. It has been argued that brain connectivity, rather than activation, patterns may lead to increased specificity in localizing cognitive processing and the effect psychiatric disorders [Menon,  ; Muldoon and Bassett,  ]. To date however, examination of connectomic architecture of the brain has contributed further to the idea that disease expression impacts shared brain regions and networks across psychiatric disorders [Crossley et al.,  ]. \n\nThe foci identified in task fMRI studies reflect the contrast between baseline and task\u2010related brain activity. Individual differences in baseline activation patterns, such as inherent low frequency fluctuations, occur independently from task and may depend on intrinsic connectivity and morphology, synaptic organization and neuronal density, and physiological parameters such as heart rate and vascular factors. These inherent activation patterns are detectable during rest fMRI, and predict those that can be observed during tasks [Zou et al.,  ]. However, this is a line of enquiry for future studies as task\u2010fMRI meta\u2010analyses of published data cannot address the contribution of baseline activity. \n\n\n### ROI Analysis and Confirmation Bias \n  \nThe use of ROI has the advantage of restricting analyses to specific brain regions thus reducing the burden of correction for multiple testing. We found a correlation between case\u2010control frequencies derived from ROI analyses and those derived from whole\u2010brain analyses, which generally supports this practice. However, on a region\u2010by\u2010region basis we also found that ROI studies resulted in the over\u2010representation of the amygdala and the caudate nucleus, which was not supported when whole\u2010brain studies were considered. Conversely, several regions, particularly the thalamus and parahippocampal gyrus, are not commonly selected in analyses based on a priori hypotheses despite data\u2010driven support from whole\u2010brain studies for their involvement in psychiatric disorders. The pre\u2010selection of ROIs, possibly in combination with the difficulty of publishing negative results, seems to bias the literature and may indirectly lead to oversimplification and over\u2010localization of neurobiological models of behavior and symptoms. Our data cautions that overreliance on ROI analysis may hamper data\u2010driven discovery and artificially exaggerate the role of some regions in psychiatric disorders while ignoring crucial contributions from others. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nAs this is a co\u2010ordinate based meta\u2010analyses, we did not include studies that did not find case\u2010control differences. Although it is statistically possible to model negative studies, such practice would rely on the assumption that negative studies were indeed sufficiently powered. Given the wide variability of tasks, sample characteristics and analyses methods, meaningful retrospective assessment of power at the level of individual studies is infeasible. Moreover, our aim was to test whether it is possible to infer diagnostic specificity for any brain region implicated by available task\u2010fMRI data. \n\nWe do not examine the effect of symptom severity as there was little overlap in scales within diagnosis and particularly across diagnoses. We consider that symptom severity is unlikely to have changed our results given the lack of a significant effect of diagnosis in the topology of case\u2010control differences despite the variable clinical presentation of the patient samples. The studies we considered varied widely in the details of their task designs and within\u2010subject condition contrasts. We were guided by the RDoC project in assigning the different tasks to their purported cognitive domains as we were interested in identifying associations between RDoC domains and diagnosis on case\u2010control differences in patterns of task\u2010fMRI activation. It is theoretically possible, although unlikely given the general lack of diagnosis\u2010specific findings, that other approaches to task classification may have yielded different results. However, we consider the RDoC scheme to represent the best approximation to a gold standard classification for fMRI tasks. \n\nWe used a standard atlas to map the reported coordinates as this facilitates interpretation of the results. As foci could only be mapped to regions included in the atlas, we ensured that our chosen atlas included all main subcortical regions, such as the nucleus accumbens, which proved to be important. As larger brain regions are by default more likely to include more coordinates, we accounted for this by normalizing the number of studies by region volume, by covarying for region volume, or by comparing the frequency distributions against predicted frequency distributions under the null hypothesis given the same regions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe findings of this study suggests that case\u2010control differences in task\u2010fMRI activation reveal a shared topography for SCZ, BD, MDD, anxiety disorders, and OCD. This shared topography explains common deficits in cognitive circuits but does not fully account for variability in clinical presentation and cannot be assumed to imply shared etiological or pathogenic mechanisms. Our findings encourage studies that cross diagnostic boundaries, emphasize the importance of whole\u2010brain studies and urge the careful interpretation and consideration of ROI studies. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 5347927, "text_md5": "2fbf73469f5710bf390260991db30153", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 129], "journal": [130, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 292], "keywords": [306, 488], "abstract": [501, 2208], "body": [2217, 39890]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 28067006, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.23486", "pmcid": "5347927", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5347927", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5347927"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5347927\">5347927</a>", "list_title": "PMC5347927  Addressing reverse inference in psychiatric neuroimaging: Meta\u2010analyses of task\u2010related brain activation in common mental disorders"}

With PTSD affecting social, interpersonal and occupational functioning, clinicians as well as the National Institute of Health are very interested in identifying the most effective psychological treatment to reduce PTSD. From research findings, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is considered as one of the effective treatment of PTSD. In this paper, we present the results of a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on PTSD after MVA through activation likelihood estimation. We found that PTSD following MVA is characterized by neural modifications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cerebral structure involved in fear-conditioning mechanisms. Basing on previous findings in both humans and animals, which demonstrate that desensitization techniques and extinction protocols act on the limbic system, the effectiveness of EMDR and of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) may be related to the fact that during these therapies the ACC is stimulated by desensitization. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTraumatic events (including not only large-scale disasters but also common day-to-day events, such as Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are an important cause of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders. Harvey and Bryant ( ) reports the presence of acute stress disorders (ASD) in 13% of MVA survivors, and according to Mayou et al. ( ) one year after a MVA a quarter of those followed up showed psychiatric disorders, with 11% affected by post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). \n\nPTSD is a relatively common psychiatric disorder occurring as a consequence of a major traumatic event. It is clinically characterized by the following symptoms: involuntarily re-experiencing phenomena (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive images as well as recurrent distressing thoughts of the event); avoidance of talking about or being reminded of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, difficulty in concentrating, increased irritability and hypervigilance) (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association,  ,  ). \n\nDifferent types of psychological therapies have been proposed in the treatment of PTSD, including exposure therapy (Creamer et al.,  ), cognitive therapy (Resick and Schnicke,  ; Ehlers et al.,  ), psychodynamic psychotherapy (Brom et al.,  ) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro,  ). EMDR is currently an effective psychological treatment, recognized and recommended as a firstline treatment for trauma in numerous international guidelines (Bisson and Andrew,  ). According to the review by Ponniah and Hollon ( ) EMDR ameliorates PTSD symptoms significantly more than waiting list, standard care, and pill placebo. They also reported that a number of studies found that EMDR was superior to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) on some measures of PTSD symptoms. However, all of these studies had mixed trauma samples. Another data coming from this review is that between 77 and 90% of EMDR patients no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the end of treatment. Ponniah and Hollon findings provide support for the use of EMDR for all patients with PTSD. \n\nEMDR is a supplementary trauma-focused therapy that includes elements from other effective psychotherapies in a structured protocol drawn from an information processing model of PTSD (Bisson et al.,  ). It requires the individual suffering from PTSD to focus attention on a traumatic memory whilst simultaneously visually tracking the therapist\u2019s finger as it moves across his/her visual field, and then to engage in a restructuring of the memory (Shapiro,  ). Eye movements are the most common form of bilateral stimulation, but stimulation might also be auditory (alternating tones) or sensory (finger tapping). It acts by using dual attention tasks to help the patient process the traumatic event while focusing on negative trauma-related memories, emotions and thoughts during the performance of a task that requires a bilateral stimulation (e.g., eye movements; hand tapping; tones) until a growth in more positive trauma-related thoughts (Jensen,  ; Shepherd et al.,  ; Marcus et al.,  ). \n\nSince its discovery, EMDR has been considered one of the treatments of choice for PTSD, even though studies on its effectiveness are often hindered by methodological problems (see for a critical review Cahill et al.,  ), and in the view of some authors \u201cwhat is effective in EMDR (imaginal exposure) is not new, and what is new (eye movements) is not effective\u201d (McNally,  , p. 2). Although bilateral stimulation is discussed controversially (Cahill et al.,  ), growing evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of EMDR in treating both PTSD in victims and mourning in survivors (Sprang,  ; Solomon and Rando,  ; see also meta-analysis studies: Bisson et al.,  ; Lee and Cuijpers,  ; Watts et al.,  ). Lee and Cuijpers ( ) performed a meta-analysis in which 15 clinical and 11 experimental studies demonstrated different effects of bilateral stimulation through eye movements compared with those produced by other exposure therapies. Possible explanations for the effectiveness of alternating bilateral stimulation are: stimulation acts specifically on disintegrated information related to the traumatic event, or boosts the processing of emotionally memories or, last but not least, may enhance emotional processing in general (Sprang,  ; Korn and Leeds,  ). Herkt et al. ( ) recently observed in healthy subjects without post-traumatic symptoms increased activation in the right amygdala during alternating auditory bilateral stimulation, as used in EMDR, while processing emotionally negative stimuli. These authors suggested that the increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models (Shapiro,  ,  ) of how alternating bilateral stimulation might help with the therapeutic reintegration of information. Specifically, Shapiro ( ) suggests two possible interpretations for the effects of alternating bilateral stimulation: (i) it may boost the processing of any emotionally laden material in general; or (ii) it may have a specific effect just on disintegrated information related to the traumatic episode. Clinicians also observe a decrease in vividness and arousal related to trauma-associated stimuli after EMDR, and neuroimaging studies show that after EMDR there is a decreased activation in limbic areas and increased activation in prefrontal brain regions known to be responsible for cognitive control after the completion of successful treatments (Lansing et al.,  ; Pagani et al.,  ). Clinical trials suggest that different traumatic events interact with individual factors (such as personality, gender and genetic factors) and lead to different physical and behavioral outcomes as well as a different prevalence of PTSD (Ditlevsen and Elklit,  ; Santiago et al.,  ; Husarewycz et al.,  ; Perrin et al.,  ). Even if altered brain areas after PTSD are common and play complementary roles in maintaining the PTSD symptomatology, such as fear conditioning of trauma-related stimuli and failing to recall fear extinction (Pitman et al.,  ). However, specific network of areas could be observed due to specific trauma. In details, PTSD after physical or sexual abuse modifies specific brain structures including the middle and anterior cingulate cortex (MCC; ACC), precuneus (pCU) and middle frontal gyrus (see Shin et al.,  ; Lanius et al.,  ,  ). These brain regions are involved in pain processing, fear, sadness and proprioceptive information. Differently, in the PTSD after combat-related trauma alterations have been found in a network of areas including the bilateral insula, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), superior parietal lobe (SPL) and hippocampus (Pissiota et al.,  ; Britton et al.,  ; Geuze et al.,  ; Morey et al.,  ). Also these structures are known to be involved in emotional processing, especially of sadness (Vogt,  ), and in monitoring internal body states, but they are also involved in a wide range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory, spatial navigation, imagining and planning for the future (Hassabis and Maguire,  ; Vann et al.,  ; Boccia et al.,  ). A specific network of areas is present also in PTSD after catastrophe and includes the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG; Hou et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Mazza et al.,  ). Specifically, the PHG has a crucial role in spatial navigation and in scene perception (Epstein and Morgan,  ) and it is reported only in this kind of trauma, likely due to the fact that the natural disasters mostly involved the surrounding environment and familiar places. Taking together these fMRI studies seem suggest that PTSD due to different kind of trauma can be different from a neurological and cognitive point of view. As a consequence also the variability in the psychological therapies effectiveness could be partially explained by the existence of different neural substrates underpinning the main disorder. \n\nIn view of this evidence, the main aim of the present study is to examine the extent to which neurobiological evidence supports the specific treatment of PTSD after MVA with EMDR. To pursue this aim we first reviewed previous neuroimaging studies about PTSD after MVA and those about neural correlates of EMDR. We hypothesized that by modulating the dysfunctional network of PTSD-MVA, EMDR may be the treatment of choice for patients who develop PTSD after a MVA. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on PTSD after MVA to assess neural network functional changes in people suffering from PTSD following a MVA, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Results have been discussed in light of current evidence about the neural underpinnings of EMDR, which suggests a specific and biologically-based approach to PTSD after MVA. \n\n### Neural Correlates of PTSD After Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) \n  \nIn the last decade different studies have assessed the neurobiological effect of PTSD after MVA (PTSD-MVA). fMRI studies mainly adopted trauma script-driven imagery paradigms, during which participants were required to remember olfactory, auditory, somato-sensory and visual sensations that were associated with their traumatic event (Frewen et al.,  , ; Osuch et al.,  ) or trauma-related pictures (Zhang et al.,  ). In PTSD-MVA patients, listening to trauma scripts leads to decreased activation in the bilateral amygdala and perirhinal cortex (Osuch et al.,  ). Studies also showed a negative correlation in PTSD patients between Emotional Awareness (measured by Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale, LEAS) and activation in the ACC during trauma script-driven imagery (Frewen et al.,  ). In terms of emotional processing, the altered activation and deactivation in the limbic system (i.e., ACC, perirhinal cortex and amygdala) may be the biological substrates of emotional dysfunctions, such as emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, observed in PTSD patients. Actually, Armony et al. ( ) found increased amygdala activation for unmasked happy faces, compared to fearful unmasked faces in PTSD patients. Their finding may contribute to explain why emotional numbing, that is the inability to fully experience positive emotions, is associated with PTSD (Litz and Gray,  ). Furthermore, as stressed by Mazza et al. ( ) emotional numbing is closely associated with emotion processing, and points to a deficit in the acquired ability to understand/share emotions with others. fMRI evidence showed that people suffering from PTSD have functional alteration in emotional brain regions such as the amygdala and insula when presented with fearful and happy faces (Hendler et al.,  ; Armony et al.,  ). \n\nIn a delayed-response working memory task, where emotional (trauma-related) and non-emotional pictures were presented in the delay phase, PTSD-MVA patients showed higher activation in the emotion-processing regions, including the amygdala, precuneus and fusiform gyrus, but lower activation in the inferior frontal cortex, insula and left supramarginal gyrus than the control group (Zhang et al.,  ). The importance of these structures in emotional processing was demonstrated as far back in time as 1948, with the description of symptoms of Phineas Gage, a railroad construction foreman who as a consequence of a rock-blasting accident reported a large lesion in the left frontal lobe. His was one of the earliest documented cases providing evidence that frontal lobes were linked to judgment, decision-making, social conduct and personality (Bechara and Damasio,  ) in spite of a preserved intellect. Not only do frontal lobes contribute to delineating personality and monitoring emotions, they also play a crucial role in emotional processing, performed by some limbic structures, such as the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex and enthorinal cortex. Specifically, the amygdala is involved in fear conditioning (for a review see Janak and Tye,  ). \n\nIn addition, studies using resting-state fMRI paradigms demonstrated that individuals with PTSD-MVA showed a different amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, ALFF), with an increased ALFF in the left medial prefrontal cortex and the right ACC (Bing et al.,  ). A PET study also found a hyperperfusion in the right medial prefrontal cortex and ACC in people with PTSD-MVA (Osuch et al.,  ). Furthermore, Qin et al. ( ), using resting-state fMRI to assess functional connectivity in individuals with PTSD-MVA, found that compared with control participants people with PTSD exhibited decreased PCC connectivity with the right lingual and middle temporal gyri, as well as with the left lingual gyrus. On the other hand, the left inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and insula, left medial frontal lobe and ACC, and right medial frontal gyrus showed increased PCC connectivity in people with PTSD (Qin et al.,  ). These results suggest that patients with PTSD showed different patterns of resting-state functional connectivity. This is a method of functional neuroimaging that makes it possible to evaluate brain region interaction while individuals are not performing any cognitive task. Specifically, Qin et al. ( ) suggested that the increase in functional connectivity could explain the abnormal emotional responses in patients with PTSD, and interpreted the decrease in functional connectivity as being due to comorbid psychiatric disorders. \n\nStructural studies of PTSD after MVA mainly found a decrease in cortical thickness in the left medial prefrontal cortex, ACC and middle frontal gyrus as well as in the right STG (Bing et al.,  ). They also showed increased ALFF values in the prefrontal cortex, ACC and cerebellum. This increased regional activity is known to be important for emotional processing (for an extensive review see Drevets,  ). \n\nFurthermore, structural connectivity network analysis in people with PTSD-MVA, assessed by using diffusion tensor tractography, demonstrated abnormal global properties mainly due to an increased shortest path length (Long et al.,  ). Furthermore, individuals with PTSD-MVA showed enhanced nodal centralities in the bilateral anterior cingulate and pallidum, and in the hippocampus and PHG, and decreased nodal centralities in medial orbito-frontal cortex (Long et al.,  ). These authors suggest that as the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the extinction of conditioned fear, the disruption of the nodal centralities of the orbitofrontal cortex plays a role in the persistence of PTSD symptoms. \n\nIn summary, fMRI evidence showed that PTSD-MVA is characterized by the alteration in the limbic system (i.e., ACC, perirhinal cortex and amygdala) in the left medial prefrontal cortex, in the orbitofrontal cortex and in the middle frontal gyrus as well as in the right STG. These areas are also involved in different degree of changes also in PTSD caused by other traumas, however, the limbic system and in particular of the ACC are more involved in PTSD due to MVA with respect to other traumas. However, more fMRI studies should be performed to better understand neural mechanisms underlying different type of traumas and above all to state that an area is involved only in one type of trauma with respect to another one it should be performed a meta-analysis in which neural correlates coming from different studies on different traumas are analyzed with the aim to individuate cluster of activations. \n\n\n### Neural Correlates of EMDR \n  \nWhile several studies have assessed the behavioral effect of EMDR therapy (as reported above), less attention has been given to neural correlates of recovery after EMDR. One of the most important findings comes from neurophysiological studies, using electroencephalography (EEG). It has recently been found that EMDR facilitates the processing of traumatic memories in eye movement desensitization by improving interhemispheric coherence, measured by EEG (Samara et al.,  ). With regard to brain regions supporting EMDR efficacy in PTSD, both functional and structural neuroimaging studies have been conducted. In a single case analysis Levin and colleagues, using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), found that recovery from PTSD symptoms after EMDR is correlated to increased activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the left frontal lobe (Levin et al.,  ). These authors concluded that successful treatment of PTSD does not reduce arousal at the limbic level, but rather enhances the ability to differentiate real from imagined threats (Levin et al.,  ). Further studies shed some light on the possible neural mechanism involved in recovery from PTSD after EMDR therapy. Lansing et al. ( ), using SPECT to assess the neural effect of EMDR therapy in Police Officers with PTSD, found decreased activation in the left and right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, and right precentral frontal lobe and increased activation in the left IFG, after 10 h (4 sessions) of EMDR therapy. Furthermore, Nardo et al. ( ) used MRI and Voxel Based Morphometry to assess neural predictors of EMDR therapy in people developing PTSD after occupational trauma. These authors found that individuals who did not respond to EMDR showed a significantly lower gray matter density than responders in the bilateral posterior cingulate, as well as in the right anterior insula, anterior PHG and amygdala. They also found that gray matter density negatively correlated with trauma load in the bilateral posterior cingulate, left anterior insula, and right anterior PHG. Thus, they concluded that gray matter lower density in limbic and paralimbic cortices was associated with PTSD diagnosis, trauma load and EMDR treatment outcome. \n\nAs regards the neurobiological mechanism underlying EMDR effects, it has been proposed that the repetitive redirecting of attention in EMDR induces a neurobiological state, similar to that of REM sleep, which allows for re-processing of traumatic memories (Stickgold,  ). Specifically, Stickgold ( ) proposed that EMDR leads to a reduction in the strength of hippocampally mediated episodic memories and amygdala-dependent emotional memories. This hypothesis is consistent with the neuroanatomical findings reported above. \n\nThe above-reported neuroimaging evidence seems to suggest that by modulating the neural circuits altered in PTSD after MVA, EMDR may represent the \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d for PTSD-MVA. EMDR modulating activation in limbic areas and prefrontal regions (Lansing et al.,  ; Pagani et al.,  ) may actually result in the regulation of the dysfunctional network in PTSD-MVA patients, allowing for the reprocessing of episodic and emotional traumatic memories. \n\nIn the paragraphs below we will present results from a meta-analysis of the previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD-MVA, which suggest a biological-founded model for treating PTSD after MVA. \n\n\n\n## Meta-Analysis \n  \n### Studies Selection \n  \nA systematic method was adopted to review literature. The search was carried out using PubMed, a free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature in which all articles using fMRI method are reported. Relevant articles were identified through searches using the following string: (PTSD FMRI) OR PTSD PET. Searches of this database were limited to articles written in English. This produced 615 papers. Our a-priori inclusion criteria for papers were: (1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET); this excluded papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. (2) Providing of coordinates of activation foci, either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space. (3) All participants in the studies were diagnosed with PTSD after MVA. (4) PTSD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, including symptoms persisting for 6 months or more. (5) Other psychiatric disorders or other trauma-related PTSD were excluded. (6) Only group studies were included. Two authors (L.P. and M.B.) independently identified studies matching with the criteria reported above. Only published studies were included in our meta-analysis. \n\nUsing these criteria, we selected only 6 papers reporting 9 individual experiments on PTSD-MVA patients (440 subjects; 30 activation foci). Meta-analysis was carried out on selected studies using the \u201cactivation likelihood estimation\u201d (ALE) analysis. Studies are summarized in Table  . \n  \n fMRI Studies on PTSD-MVA included in the ALE meta-analysis  . \n  \n Notes. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were adopted in the three studies in which time is not specified  . \n  \n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) analyzes the probability that a voxel will contain at least one of the activation foci; it is calculated at each voxel, and results in a thresholded ALE map. ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modeling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nWe performed a general ALE analysis to determine whether a consistent neural substrate of PTSD was found across neuroimaging studies of PTSD after MVA. Then, by means of meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), used to assess the functional connectivity of specific brain regions (Robinson et al.,  ), we investigated the functional connectivity of a brain region that emerged as showing a consistent modification in PTSD-MVA, from the first ALE analysis. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.1.1 (brainmap.org) with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE). According to Eickhoff et al.\u2019s ( ) modified procedure, the ALE values of each voxel in the brain were computed, and a test was performed to determine the null distribution of the ALE statistic of each voxel. The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) value was automatically computed, as this parameter is empirically determined (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The thresholded ALE map was computed using   p   values from the previous step and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) at the 0.05 level of significance (Tom Nichol\u2019s FDR algorithm). Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200 mm  was chosen. A cluster analysis was performed on the thresholded map. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template (brainmap.org) using Mricro. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nResults from the general ALE meta-analysis showed a cluster of activation in the right ACC (  x   = 8;   y   = 46;   z   = 12) (Figure  ). Thus, we assessed the functional connectivity of the ACC by means of MACM. MACM showed patterns of functional connectivity of the ACC, especially at the level of the frontal, parietal and limbic lobes (Figure  ). In detail, we found clusters of activation in the bilateral ACC, insula, IFG, left precentral and cingulate gyri and claustrum, as well as in the right middle and superior frontal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, globus pallidus and thalamus (Figure  ). \n  \n Results from ALE meta-analysis. (A)   Results from the general ALE meta-analysis on neural modifications of PTSD after Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs).   (B)   Functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), assessed by means of meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main aim of the present study is to provide neurobiological evidence on which to base a biological-founded treatment model for PTSD after MVA. Neuroimaging evidence reviewed in the introduction section appears to suggest that by modulating the neural circuits altered in PTSD after MVA, EMDR may represent a \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d for PTSD-MVA. Thus, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of PTSD-MVA to assess (a) brain areas showing consistent modifications in PTSD after MVA; and (b) their functional connectivity. \n\nGlobal results from the present meta-analysis demonstrate that PTSD-MVA is correlated with consistent neural modifications mainly located at the level of the right ACC, whose activity is in turn strongly correlated with activity in the frontal, parietal and limbic lobes. Also based on previous neuroimaging evidence of neural underpinnings of EMDR (Levin et al.,  ; Lansing et al.,  ; Nardo et al.,  ; Samara et al.,  ), we propose that by modulating the dysfunctional network of PTSD-MVA, EMDR may be a treatment of choice for patients who develop PTSD after a MVA. In other words, by working on the neural network that we found altered in PTSD-MVA, EMDR may produce a normalization of the dysfunctional network. \n\nThe neural impact of other therapies does in any case need to be considered. Firstly, the main element of all psychological therapies treating anxiety disorders (including PTSD) is exposure to the feared object or context (Joseph and Gray,  ). Exposure is based on extinction learning (Myers and Davis,  ; Quirk and Mueller,  ; Herry et al.,  ), which relies on inhibition of the amygdala by the prefrontal regions and engages executive functions, mainly recruiting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LeDoux,  ). Furthermore, the greater activity in the left frontostriatal circuit is associated with lower PTSD symptom severity after treatment with CBT (Falconer et al.,  ). Also, the greater bilateral amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate activation is associated with a poor outcome after CBT (Bryant et al.,  ). CBT has been found to regulate brain activations at the level of frontal network and of the limbic structures (Goldapple et al.,  ). In fMRI studies the changes after psychotherapies administered to face major depression, phobia, obsessive compulsive disorders emerge that the psychotherapies (i.e., CBT, Interpersonal Therapy, Behavioral Therapy; Mindfulness based cognitive therapy; computer assisted cognitive remediation and psychodynamic therapy) mainly targets at brain networks (including precuneus and orbito frontal cortex) able to mediate a top-down effect on symptoms improving. They might induce modifications especially in the medial portion of the parietal (i.e., precuneus, as described before), frontal (i.e., superior and inferior frontal gyri) and temporal lobes (i.e., middle temporal gyrus) (Brody et al.,  ; Yamanishi et al.,  ; Buchheim et al.,  ; Ives-Deliperi et al.,  ; Meusel et al.,  ; Yoshimura et al.,  ). Some brain areas modulated by psychotherapies are common with those modulated by EMDR, such as frontal, parietal and limbic structures. However, EMDR acts on ACC that is an important role in the fear extinction. ACC is also a structure modified in PTSD and specifically in PTSD due to MVA. \n\nA systematic review of psychological therapies for chronic PTSD showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms is reduced by using individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) and EMDR. This result emerged from 70 studies involving a total of 4,761 participants, demonstrating more effective TFCBT and EMDR than waitlist/usual care (Bisson et al.,  ). These authors found no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post-treatment, although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non-TFCBT at follow-up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non-TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Worthy of note however is the fact that a considerable proportion of patients (30\u201350%) do not respond to TFCBT (Bradley et al.,  ). Generally speaking, both TFCBT and EMDR are highly efficacious in reducing PTSD symptoms, due to common underlying factors involved in different treatments for PTSD, such as an exposure model to treat the trauma, which causes the patient to rethink previous interpretations of the traumatic event, addressing faulty cognitions or maladaptive copying strategies, and also promoting fear extinction (Bradley et al.,  ). \n\nEMDR on the other hand has repeatedly been found to rely on the ACC (Yamasaki et al.,  ), which we found to be biased in PTSD after MVA. Thus, EMDR may be considered one of the treatments of choice for PTSD after MVA, since it directly acts on the brain region showing an alteration in these patients. It is also possible that the effectiveness of EMDR on PTSD-MVA is related to its action on conditioned fear, mediated by ACC, due to repeated exposure to the traumatic event, while other cognitive therapies like CBT, promoting the rationalization and acceptance of the trauma, modulate the response of the prefrontal cortex, inducing a secondary response on the ACC. This different action could explain the difference between EMDR and CBT, supporting Solomon and Rando ( ), who reported positive treatment effects, obtained more quickly with EMDR compared with other forms of therapies. \n\nAnyway, EMDR cannot be considered suitable just for MVA-PTSD. Actually, EMDR has been successfully used, to treat PTSD after different traumatic events (Lansing et al.,  ; El Khoury-Malhame et al.,  ; Bisson et al.,  ). Unfortunately, as highlighted in the introduction, the paucity of studies assessing neural correlates of EMDR therapy does not allow us to come to any definite conclusion in respect of firstline treatment, even if current data support a biological foundation for EMDR in treating PTSD-MVA and PTSD after other types of traumatic events, such as rape, work-related accidents or duty-induced PTSD (Lansing et al.,  ; El Khoury-Malhame et al.,  ; Bisson et al.,  ). It should be noted that current literature lacks systematic studies that take into account the nature of the trauma event and the treatment effect. Thus, even though further systematic studies are needed to prove that EMDR is one of the best approaches to treating PTSD following a MVA, we believe it may be one of the most effective. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 4404810, "text_md5": "8d0e847052a3193425f867f39f7194bd", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 112], "journal": [113, 131], "publication_year": [133, 137], "title": [148, 246], "keywords": [260, 384], "abstract": [397, 1501], "body": [1510, 31967]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25954183, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2015.00213", "pmcid": "4404810", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404810", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4404810"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404810\">4404810</a>", "list_title": "PMC4404810  EMDR therapy for PTSD after motor vehicle accidents: meta-analytic evidence for specific treatment"}
{"text": "Messina, Irene and Bianco, Simone and Sambin, Marco and Viviani, Roberto\nFront Psychol, 2015\n\n# Title\n\nExecutive and semantic processes in reappraisal of negative stimuli: insights from a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies\n\n# Keywords\n\nemotion regulation\nreappraisal\nreappraisal via perspective-taking\nreappraisal of stimuli\nALE\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nNeuroimaging investigations have identified the neural correlates of reappraisal in executive areas. These findings have been interpreted as evidence for recruitment of controlled processes, at the expense of automatic processes when responding to emotional stimuli. However, activation of semantic areas has also been reported. The aim of the present work was to address the issue of the importance of semantic areas in emotion regulation by comparing recruitment of executive and semantic neural substrates in studies investigating different reappraisal strategies. With this aim, we reviewed neuroimaging studies on reappraisal and we classified them in two main categories: reappraisal of stimuli (RS) and reappraisal via perspective taking (RPT). We applied a coordinate-based meta-analysis to summarize the results of fMRI studies on different reappraisal strategies. Our results showed that reappraisal, when considered regardless of the specific instruction used in the studies, involved both executive and semantic areas of the brain. When considering different reappraisal strategies separately, in contrast, we found areas associated with executive function to be prominently recruited by RS, even if also semantic areas were activated. Instead, in RPT the most important clusters of brain activity were found in parietal and temporal semantic areas, without significant clusters in executive areas. These results indicate that modulation of activity in semantic areas may constitute an important aspect of emotion regulation in reappraisal, suggesting that semantic processes may be more important to understand the mechanism of emotion regulation than previously thought. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotion regulation plays a key role for the capacity, unique to humans, to react in a flexible way to emotional events ( , pp. 201\u2013216;  , pp. S47\u2013S53). Indeed, the capacity to adaptively regulate negative emotion seems to be a protective factor against the development and maintenance of psychopathology ( , pp. 974\u2013983;  , pp. 217\u2013237;  , pp. 128\u2013134). Moreover, the improvement of adaptive emotion regulation skills is one of the most important aims in several psychotherapeutic treatment approaches ( , pp. 611\u2013630;  , pp. 1230\u20131237) and interventions in health psychology ( , pp. 215\u2013221;  , pp. 205\u2013210). Especially in neuroscience, the concept of emotion regulation is key to explaining brain functioning alterations associated to psychopathology ( , pp. 413\u2013418) and their normalization due to psychotherapy ( , pp. 788\u2013796;  , p. e74657). \n\nIndividuals may use different emotion regulation skills to change the spontaneous flow of emotional reactions. For example, following stressful events individuals may attempt to positively reappraise the event ( , pp. 345\u2013360), use humor ( , pp. 1895\u20131909), avoid thoughts associated to such events by suppressing them ( , pp. 59\u201391), or may ruminate on the stressful event ( , p. 163). Differences between emotion regulation strategies are therefore of great interest in the context of models of mental health and psychological intervention. \n\nAmong emotion regulation strategies, reappraisal has been defined as \u201c  construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in non-emotional terms  \u201d ( , pp. 281\u2013291). The importance of reappraisal is due to its adaptive value in decreasing emotional experiences in response to negative events. For example, the habitual use of reappraisal has been found to be associated with the increased expression of positive emotion, more effective interpersonal functioning and increased well-being ( , pp. 281\u2013291;  , pp. 348\u2013362). In developmental psychology, evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that the habitual use of reappraisal predicts the development of interpersonal flexibility, interpersonal openness and stronger social connections in children and adolescents ( , pp. 780\u2013784;  , pp. 779\u2013786). In clinical psychology, it has been shown that reappraisal is positively correlated with mental health and negatively with emotional disorders ( , pp. 974\u2013983;  , pp. 341\u2013362). \n\nSeveral recent studies have used neuroimaging to clarify the neural mechanisms mediating reappraisal. In most of these studies, participants were exposed to negative emotional stimuli and were instructed to use emotion regulation strategies to regulate their emotional response to them ( , pp. 1215\u20131229). Using this methodology, neural correlates of emotion regulation have been identified as increases of activation in several prefrontal areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) ( , pp. 153\u2013158;  , pp. 2981\u20132990). Accompanying these increases, the decrease of amygdala activation has been reported as a correlate of successful regulation of negative emotions ( , pp. 275\u2013285). The involvement of prefrontal areas has been consistently reported in tasks that recruit executive attention and working memory, the control mechanisms that supervise the activation of various cognitive sub-processes through voluntary attention ( , pp. 637\u2013671;  , pp. 255\u2013274;  , pp. 46\u201359). Building on these well-established models of executive function, neurobiological models of reappraisal have focused on the concept of cognitive control to characterize the key process involved in reappraisal when responding to emotional stimuli ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. 797\u2013814). In this form of reappraisal, voluntary attention is directed to modulate responses to perceived emotional stimuli, instead of letting automatic reactions alone determine behavioral, physiological and experiential responses. \n\nOne outstanding question concerns the involvement of semantic areas in emotion regulation. Semantic processes include attributes of cognitive representations that are based on the generalization of experiences in the interaction with the environment and are subsequently used to give meaning to the new experience ( , p. 4). In emotion regulation studies, temporal, inferior parietal and ventromedial prefrontal areas have been reported as activated during reappraisal tasks ( , pp. 2981\u20132990). These areas are considered part of the semantic system ( , pp. 976\u2013987;  , pp. 2767\u20132796), which is the neural substrate of mental functions that allow the formation and recovery of conceptual knowledge, including representations of elements that are relevant in the context of emotion regulation such as generalization of emotional experiences ( , p. 223) and relationships that govern social interactions ( , pp. 1628\u20131635;  , pp. 6430\u20136435). \n\nThe present study extends previous meta-analyses of reappraisal studies ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355) by addressing the issue of the involvement of executive and semantic systems in emotion regulation of negative stimuli and by comparing recruitment of executive and semantic neural substrates in studies investigating different reappraisal strategies. We separately considered two different strategies of reappraisal [reappraisal of stimuli (RS) and reappraisal via perspective-taking] and performed a contrast analysis to examine the existence of significant statistical differences between the two sets of studies. The importance of this analysis stems from the consequent refinement of current neurobiological models of reappraisal, which focus on the concept of cognitive control. In contrast, the present study suggests that brain systems associated with cognitive control are not central in all forms of reappraisal, and at least another neural network \u2013 the semantic system \u2013 should be considered in emotion regulation. With this aim, we analyzed separately studies of different reappraisal strategies and we performed a contrast analysis to statistically compare these different strategies. \n\nOur attempt to compare different emotion regulation strategies required addressing a taxonomic issue that had remained unresolved despite the increasing number of neuroimaging studies on emotion regulation. Neuroimaging studies on reappraisal provide similar instructions to investigate different strategies and different instructions to investigate similar reappraisal strategies. For example, two studies that both aimed to evaluate the effect of reappraisal of emotional stimuli provided participants with quite different instructions.  , pp. 409\u2013423) asked participants to \u201c  decrease their emotional reactions by distancing themselves from the picture, by becoming a detached observer through thinking that the depicted situation is not real, only a picture  \u201d (p. 412), but specified that \u201c  subjects were told not to substitute negative emotions with positive emotion  \u201d (p. 412). In contrast,  , pp. 210\u2013219) asked participants to \u201c  transform the scenario depicted into positive terms (e.g., women crying outside of a church could be alternatively interpreted as expressing tears of joy from wedding ceremony rather than of sorrow from a funeral)  \u201d (p. 211). However, similar instructions have been used to evaluate different strategies of emotion regulation. For example, to investigate the strategy used in suppression,  , pp. 502\u2013510) have used a typical instruction used in reappraisal studies: \u201c  to suppress any emotional reaction to the sad stimuli. That is, they had to voluntarily decrease the intensity of the sad feelings felt in response to the sad film excerpts. To accomplish that goal, subjects were encouraged to distance themselves from those stimuli (i.e., to become a detached observer)  \u201d (p. 503). \n\nThe need for taxonomy of reappraisal strategies was addressed in a meta-analysis of behavioral studies on emotion regulation conducted by  , p. 775). In this work three different kind of reappraisal were described: (1) RS, in which, participants are instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of the stimulus; (2) reappraisal via perspective taking (RPT), in which participants are instructed to take another perspective (usually the perspective of a detached observer); (3) reappraisal of emotion, in which participants are instructed to interpret the emotion associated to experimental stimuli by accepting their emotional experience. Using this classification,   were able to detect differences between specific reappraisal strategies. For example, reappraising using perspective taking proved to be more effective than reappraising the emotional stimulus or the emotional response in influencing emotional experience and expression. However, with the exception of this study, the comparison between different reappraisal strategies has been neglected in both behavioral and neuroimaging investigations. \n\nIn the present work we used the classification proposed by  , p. 775) to systematically review neuroimaging studies on reappraisal and shed light on the specific aspects of different strategies of reappraisal by investigating possible differences in the associated neural substrates. We adopted a coordinate-based meta-analytic technique specifically developed for neuroimaging studies, the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method ( , pp. 155-164), to quantify the results of fMRI studies on different reappraisal strategies. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Studies Selection and Classification \n  \nNeuroimaging studies on reappraisal were collected through searches in PUBMED  and Google Scholar  using the keywords \u201cemotion regulation neuroimaging\u201d or \u201caffective regulation neuroimaging.\u201d Additional studies were obtained reviewing the references of papers founded on PUBMED database. \n\nWe included all the papers in accordance with the following criteria: (a) use of fMRI to investigate neural correlates of reappraisal; (b) use of general linear models to analyze contrasts between reappraisal conditions versus control condition and viceversa; (d) involvement of adult healthy participants; (e) activation foci reported in 3D coordinates (x, y, z) in stereotactic space. Despite the presence of studies that have focused their analyses on specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) and may therefore bias the detection of cerebral areas ( ), we included both whole brain and ROIs analyses because of the exiguous number of studies that have investigated the whole brain activity in reappraisal (see   Table   ). Exclusion criteria were: (a) studies investigating emotion regulation strategies different than reappraisal; (b) studies investigating reappraisal of positive emotional stimuli; (c) studies investigating reappraisal with the purpose of increasing emotional responses. Following these criteria a total of 21 studies and 437 participants were found (the main features of selected studies are shown in   Table   ). \n  \nMain features of studies included in the meta-analysis. \n    \nA careful coding of emotion regulation instructions that participants received in the neuroimaging studies was followed (see   Table    for original instructions of experimental and control tasks reported in single studies). Thus, according to the taxonomy proposed by  , pp. 775), we classified reappraisal strategies as: (1) Reappraisal of stimulus in which participants are instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of the stimulus, for example thinking that it is not real (RS;   N   = 8); (2) RPT in which participants are instructed to take the perspective of a detached observer; (RPT;   N   = 7); (3) Reappraisal of emotional response (  N   = 1), in which participants are instructed to interpret the emotion associated to experimental stimuli in a mindfulness manner ( , pp. 361\u2013366); (4) Reappraisal not-specified (  N   = 5), when instructions were generic or included more strategies. Instructions for control tasks were quite similar for all studies and they consisted in natural responses to experimental stimuli. \n\n\n### Meta-Analytic Procedure \n  \nSeveral meta-analyses were carried out based on the classification described in the previous section. Firstly, a preliminary meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the neural correlates of reappraisal regardless of the specific instructions. Secondly, on the basis of the classification of the instructions, we conducted two separate analyses to verify the existence of specific neural correlates of RPT and reappraisal of the stimulus. Because we found only one study investigating reappraisal of emotion ( , pp. 361\u2013366), we were not able to explore neural correlates of this strategy in a separate meta-analysis. \n\nTo conduct the meta-analyses, the ALE method for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data was used ( , pp. 2907\u20132926). This methods is based on the evaluation of the overlap between foci of activation found in different studies and treats the reported foci not as single points, but as centers for 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty ( , pp. 765\u2013780;  , pp. 1\u201313). To this aim, an algorithm is used to identify clusters of brain activity that show a convergence of activation across experiments and determine if the clusters thus obtained occur more frequently than in the null distribution arising from random spatial association between the results of different experiments. ALE meta-analysis was carried out using GingerALE 2.3 software distributed by the BrainMap project  ( , pp. 155\u2013164). We employed the \u201cnon-additive\u201d method, which models each focus with a Gaussian function defined by a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel size empirically determined by finding the maximum across each focus\u2019s Gaussian ( , pp. 1\u201313). The non-additive method allows the modeling of the spatial uncertainty of each focus arising from inter-subject and inter-study variability. The meta-analyses were performed in Talairach space. Coordinates reported in studies in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space were transformed into Talairach coordinates using the Lancaster transform, icbm2tal algorithm ( , pp. 677\u2013683) included in the Convert Foci tool of GingerALE. \n\nWe conducted several meta-analyses. In the first meta-analysis we included all reappraisal studies irrespective of the strategy. Foci of activation were collected from all the contrasts between reappraisal conditions versus control conditions and vice versa, as reported in the original studies. In the second meta-analysis we considered the contrasts between RS   versus   the control condition and vice versa. In the third meta-analysis we considered the contrasts between reappraisal via perspective-taking   versus   the control condition and vice versa. Finally, to test the interaction between condition (experimental condition   versus   control condition) and strategy (RS   versus   reappraisal via perspective-taking), a subtractive analysis was conducted comparing ALE values of specific reappraisal strategies (RS versus RPT;  , pp. 938\u2013949). In all cases statistical significance was determined through a permutation tests. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural Correlates of Reappraisal \n  \nThe first meta-analysis evaluated the main effect of reappraisal regardless of the specific reappraisal instruction used in the studies (see   Table   ,   Figure   ). This analysis was based on 21 studies and 437 participants, yielding a total of 245 foci for the contrast reappraisal condition versus control condition and 13 studies, 272 participants, yielding a total of 73 foci for the contrast control condition versus reappraisal condition. The probability maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.001 and corrected using false discovery rates (FDRs), the minimum clusters extent was of 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm. \n  \nSignificant clusters of brain activity in reappraisal studies. \n      \n Brain activity in reappraisal tasks.   In warm colors significant cluster of increased brain activity, in cold colors significant clusters of decrease brain activity. mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; iFG, inferior frontal gyrus; mTG, middle temporal gyrus; AG, angular gyrus; Amy, amygdala. \n  \nSignificant clusters of increased activation were found in the dorsal attentional system (dlPFC and the posterior medial prefrontal cortex, with extension to the anterior cingulated cortex). Several clusters of increased activation were located also in the semantic system, i.e., in the inferior prefrontal gyrus, superior/middle temporal gyrus and in the angular gyrus on the left side. Finally, clusters of decreased activation were found in limbic areas such as the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\n\n### Neural Correlates of Specific Reappraisal Strategies \n  \nMeta-analyses on the effect of specific strategies were conducted considering RS and RPT separately. For both meta-analyses, probability maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 and corrected using FDRs. \n\nThe meta-analysis of studies on RS included eight studies and 163 participants, yielding a total of 105 foci for the contrast RS condition versus control condition and four studies, 73 subjects yielding a total of 18 foci for the contrast control condition versus RS. The results of this meta-analysis were quite similar to the results of the main meta-analysis, with significant clusters of increased brain activation in dorsal attentional system (in dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex) and in the sematic system (temporal gyrus and angular gyrus on the left, inferior prefrontal cortex; see   Table   ,   Figure    in violet), and significant clusters of decreased activation in areas involved in emotional reactivity (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally; see   Table   ,   Figure    in violet). \n  \nSignificant clusters of brain activity in RS and (A,B) and reappraisal via perspective-taking (RPT; C,D). \n      \n Brain activity in reappraisal of stimuli and reappraisal via perspective-taking.   In violet increased brain activity during RS; in green increased brain activity during reappraisal via perspective-taking. mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; iFG, inferior frontal gyrus; mTG, middle temporal gyrus; AG, angular gyrus. \n  \nThe meta-analysis of RPT studies included seven studies and 151 participants, yielding a total of 77 foci for the contrast RPT condition versus control condition and 51 foci for the contrast control condition versus RPT. Here, the biggest clusters of increased activation were located in the right inferior parietal lobe/angular gyrus on the right and in the superior temporal gyrus on the left (see   Table   ,   Figure    in green). No significant cluster of activation was found in the prefrontal cortex. Significant clusters of decreased activation were found in the amygdala bilaterally and thalamus (see   Table   ). \n\nFinally, a comparative analysis was conducted to quantify the differences between the RS and RPT reappraisal strategies. Also in this case, probability maps were threshold at   p   < 0.01 and corrected using FDRs. Due to the small number of studies, only a cluster survived to the direct comparison between strategies. This cluster was specific for RS strategies but not for RPT. It was located in the medial prefrontal cortex (localization of the cluster in 3D Talairach coordinates:   x   = -14,   y   = 11,   z   = 54; Broadmann\u2019s area = 6;   z  -score obtained in the subtractive analysis:   z   = 3.01,   p   < 0.01 corrected for FDR). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNeurobiological models of reappraisal emphasize the role of executive function in emotional control ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. E1\u2013E24), whereas the contribution of semantic processes has been less addressed in the literature. In the present study we systematically reviewed, classified and meta-analyzed neuroimaging studies on different reappraisal strategies of negative stimuli. Our attempt was to investigate the role of executive and semantic functions in emotion regulation. Namely, we verified the involvement of these functions in reappraisal regardless of the specific form of reappraisal investigated in single studies, and considering two specific reappraisal tasks on the basis of the instruction provided by authors to participants in each single study. \n\nThe classification of neuroimaging studies on reappraisal was carried out through careful coding of emotion regulation instructions that participants received in each neuroimaging study that corresponded to our selection criteria. We focused on two main categories of studies on reappraisal that resulted to be well-represented in the literature: RS and RPT. In studies on RS participants were instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of experimental stimulus. In this case typical experimental paradigms were based on the exposure of participants to emotional negative pictures during the fMRI scanning, and they were asking to think that the picture was not real (for example, to think that the pictures showed was a movie or that the persons in the pictures were actors). In studies of reappraisal via perspective-taking participants were instructed to take the perspective of a detached observer during the exposure to negative emotional pictures. \n\nIn the main meta-analysis of reappraisal, which considered all studies regardless of the specific instruction adopted in the study, the neural substrates associated with recruitment of executive processes resulted activated by reappraisal. Significant clusters of increased activation were detected in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal/anterior cingulated areas, which are part of the voluntary attentional system ( , pp. 475\u2013483;  , pp. 284\u2013291). Accompanying such activations, clusters of decreased activity were detected in subcortical areas associated to emotional reactivity such as the amygdala ( , pp. 331\u2013348;  , pp. 811\u2013830). As in previous meta-analyses ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355), the observed increased activation in areas of the voluntary attentional system is consistent with the neurobiological model of reappraisal, which views it as a controlled process involving executive functions and working memory ( , pp. 242\u2013249). Furthermore, the decreased activation of limbic areas may be interpreted as diminished arousal following regulation ( , pp. 303\u2013312;  , pp. 1037\u20131050). Together with these results regarding the voluntary attentional system, the meta-analyses also detected activations of areas that are considered part of the semantic system, such as the temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus ( , pp. 976\u2013987;  , pp. 2767\u20132796). Despite also these results have been observed in previous meta-analyses ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355), the importance of their contribution to emotion regulation has been neglected in neurobiological models of reappraisal. \n\nIn the present study, the separate consideration of RS and RPT strategies allowed us to observe the different prominence of executive and semantic areas in the reappraisal strategies. We observed that areas of the voluntary attentional system were activated in RS strategy but not in RPT. Specifically, in the analysis in which these two strategies were directly compared a significant cluster of increased activation located in the dorsomedial/anterior cingulated cortex differentiated activations in RS from RPT reappraisal. These results suggest that the RPT strategy may rely less on executive control than RS, suggesting that executive functions might be not as essential for emotion regulation as previously thought ( , pp. 153\u2013158;  , pp. E1\u2013E24). \n\nSeveral considerations support this conclusion. According to the models of reappraisal as a form of cognitive control ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. 788\u2013796), the involvement of voluntary attention in RS should be associated with increased effectiveness in emotion regulation. However, this association was not observed in the meta-analysis, where the different involvement of prefrontal areas in RS and RPT did not correspond to different outcomes in terms of limbic activation (both strategies were associated to similar decrease in amygdala activity). These results are not surprising in the light of behavioral data to the effect that both RS and RPT are similar in reducing emotional response to unpleasant stimuli ( , pp. 435\u2013444;  , p. 775). In one study RPT was even more effective in this regard, whereas RS was more likely to maintain subjective experience and facial expression associated to the emotion elicited by the experimental stimuli ( , p. 416). Due to the absence of evidence on differences in effectiveness of the reappraisal strategies considered in the present study, the variable involvement of executive functions in RS compared to RPT may simply reflect a difference in the amount of cognitive effort required by each strategy. Neuroimaging studies of working memory have reported progressive activation of areas of the voluntary attentional system in association with the cognitive demands required by the task ( , pp. 721\u2013731). Reappraisal may involve working memory when a cognitive effort is required, but this effort may be reduced when the strategies adopted to regulate are less demanding ( , pp. 730\u2013743). Furthermore, other studies report the existence of implicit forms of emotion regulation, in which emotion are regulated without voluntary attempts to control them ( , pp. 1\u201318;  , pp. 389\u2013399). The few existing neuroimaging studies on implicit forms of emotion regulation have shown that the areas of the voluntary attentional system are not recruited ( , p. e15454) and do not correlate with individual differences in spontaneous avoidance ( , p. 239). \n\nIn contrast to the inconstant recruitment of the voluntary attentional network, the activation of semantic areas emerged as a common aspect of emotion regulation despite of the specific strategy adopted by participants. How do semantic processes contribute to emotion regulation? The presence of specific semantic content may have a role in the effectiveness of reappraisal. It is conceivable that the existence of a wealth of semantic representations that one can activate in order to reappraise emotional stimuli facilitates the generation of alternative representations of what happened. Instead, a person with poor semantic representations of contingencies related to emotionally arousing situations may have more difficulties in using semantic information to reappraise emotional stimuli. For example, black/white thinking in borderline patients may be related to their difficulties in generating mentalizing appraisals of other people\u2019s possible motives, a form of knowledge that is based on semantic memory for social interactions ( , pp. 1241\u20131253). Due to the evidence that semantic activation may play a role in emotion regulation regardless to the involvement of executive functions, our hypothesis is that semantic processes may involve different kind of attentional processes. In studies on spatial attention ( , pp. 201\u2013215;  , pp. 107\u2013123), a ventral attentional network has been described that is activated when attention is directed spontaneously to stimuli that are behaviourally relevant, regardless the voluntary attempt of participants to direct their attention to this stimuli and regardless to the salience of this stimuli, but is also recruited in studies in which top\u2013down control of emotional stimuli is required ( , pp. 306\u2013324). Such network includes the temporo-parietal junction observed in RS and RPT studies meta-analyzed in the present study. \n\nIn the context of emotion regulation, the ventral network may influence emotion regulation by conveying the influence of semantic networks due to the intervention of a proactive mechanism of control on the emotional representations ( ). Because emotion regulation strategies such as spontaneous avoidance ( , p. e15454;  , p. 239) or acceptance ( , p. 361\u2013366) also appear to recruit these areas, there is room in future studies for investigating forms of emotion regulation not based on cognitive control to enrich emotion regulation models and to clarify the adaptive value of emotion regulation strategies. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the majority of the studies which have investigated emotion regulation have used ROIs approach. The   a priori   definitions of ROIs may bias the detection of cerebral areas in emotion regulation literature, as the effects in ROIs that were defined   a priori   are likely to be overrated ( , pp. 275\u2013285). Secondly, many of the studies investigating reappraisal used quite generic instructions that did not allow us to classify the specific strategies under investigation. This limitation had the consequence to reduce the number of studies included in meta-analyses of specific strategies. Third, we cannot exclude that participants were using the strategy of distracting themselves from the experimental stimuli (despite the instruction provided by experimenters). For example, if self-distraction involved the generation of alternative verbal material, then it would be expected to be associated with the activation of semantic areas, which has been detected in words generation tasks ( , p. 153\u2013170). However, as we noted in Section \u201cDiscussion,\u201d the ready availability of appropriate alternative semantic content may be an important factor in the effectiveness of reappraisal also when following the strategy of \u201cthinking of something else.\u201d Hence, an important message of the present paper is that semantic activation may play a role in emotion regulation regardless of the involvement of executive functions. Future studies may define more carefully the specific reappraisal strategy under investigation. Because of the small number of studies included in meta-analyses of specific strategies, their results should be considered as explorative, but not conclusive. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBoth executive and semantic aspects of emotion regulation were found to be involved in functional imaging studies of emotional reappraisal, but with a different pattern according to the reappraisal strategy. In reappraisal of emotional stimuli, executive functions were found to be recruited in the meta-analysis, even if also semantic areas were activated. Instead, in RPT the most important clusters of brain activity were found on parietal and temporal semantic areas, similarly to less adaptive strategies such as suppression or avoidance. This heterogeneity suggests that executive functions are just one aspect of emotion regulation, and that their relevance may depend on the specific reappraisal strategy adopted by participants, including the depth of semantic encoding and the use of semantic networks. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 4499672, "text_md5": "f633f42fab1e2906054f10d24cddc24f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 72], "journal": [73, 86], "publication_year": [88, 92], "title": [103, 225], "keywords": [239, 346], "abstract": [359, 2048], "body": [2057, 33247]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26217277, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00956", "pmcid": "4499672", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499672", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4499672"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499672\">4499672</a>", "list_title": "PMC4499672  Executive and semantic processes in reappraisal of negative stimuli: insights from a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies"}

Patients with TS can differ markedly in the frequency, severity, and bodily distribution of tics. Moreover, there are high comorbidity rates with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and depression. This complex clinical profile may account for apparent variability of findings across neuroimaging studies that connect neural function to cognitive and motor behavior in TS. \n\nHere we crystalized information from neuroimaging regarding the functional circuitry of TS, and furthermore, tested specifically for neural determinants of tic severity, by applying activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to neuroimaging (activation) studies of TS. Fourteen task-based studies (13 fMRI and one H2O-PET) met rigorous inclusion criteria. These studies, encompassing 25 experiments and 651 participants, tested for differences between TS participants and healthy controls across cognitive, motor, perceptual and somatosensory domains. \n\nRelative to controls, TS participants showed distributed differences in the activation of prefrontal (inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri), anterior cingulate, and motor preparation cortices (lateral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area; SMA). Differences also extended into sensory (somatosensory cortex and the lingual gyrus; V4); and temporo-parietal association cortices (posterior superior temporal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex). \n\nWithin TS participants, tic severity (reported using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; YGTSS) selectively correlated with engagement of SMA, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus across tasks. \n\nThe dispersed involvement of multiple cortical regions with differences in functional reactivity may account for heterogeneity in the symptomatic expression of TS and its comorbidities.

Tics are rapid, recurrent actions or vocalisations that may range in complexity from simple brief acts such as eye blinks or coughs, to elaborate action sequences. Tics are highly variable in their presentation among individuals, with substantial differences in the frequency, complexity, and bodily location of tics. \n\nTics show a number of distinctive features. They often exhibit a classical \u2018waxing and waning\u2019 in severity and presentation over time ( ,  ,  ), and are typically exacerbated by anxiety, stress, and fatigue ( ). Although tics are commonly assumed to be compulsive and \u2018unwilled\u2019, they can be more accurately described as \u2018unvoluntary\u2019, in that an involuntary urge to move can be relieved by a volitional decision to release the tic ( ,  ). These \u2018premonitory\u2019 urges often (though not always) precede tics and occur in up to 90% of adolescents with TS ( ). Such premonitory experiences often take the form of uncomfortable sensory symptoms, and are not only subjectively perceived by patients as a key precursor event in tic expression, but are furthermore associated with greater tic severity, greater functional impairment, and poorer quality of life ( ,  ). \n\nTS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with onset of tics in childhood or adolescence. However, the lifespan trajectory is highly variable: >\u00a050% of people with TS may experience a substantial decline in tic severity by early adulthood; some may undergo complete remission; and some continue to experience tics into adulthood, sometimes accompanied by an increase in tic severity ( ,  ). \n\nThe heterogeneous presentation of TS is reflected not only in the individual expression of tics, but also in the expression of common comorbidities ( ). Perhaps only 10% of TS patients have \u2018pure\u2019 TS (i.e. tics only) ( ). The majority of TS individuals present with comorbidities, i.e. as \u2018TS\u00a0+\u2019. The two most frequent comorbid conditions are obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), each showing comorbidity rates of 30%\u201350% ( ). Arguably tic disorders, OCD, and ADHD share core behavioral and psychological features. Correspondingly, within the brain, there is overlap in putative neuroanatomical substrates, implicating fronto-striatal network dysfunction ( ). However, distinct phenotypes are likely to arise from particular developmental profiles in (epi-) genetic architecture ( ) that determine divergent clinical expression ( ). Affective symptomatology, including depression and anxiety, is also more common among patients with TS than in the general population ( ,  ). \n\nTS is linked to aberrant functioning of several neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Prescribed pharmacotherapies most commonly target dopaminergic transmission, but are not effective in all individuals at reducing tics ( ), further highlighting the heterogeneity of the condition. \n\nTheoretical and empirical knowledge suggests broadly that TS is underpinned by dysfunction within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) motor networks ( ,  ,  ,  ). These circuits underpin habitual motor behavior including the transition of goal-directed action selection to compulsive action ( ,  ). Furthermore, disorders with clear CSTC dysfunction incorporating overlapping symptoms with TS such as compulsivity in OCD ( ), or opponent symptoms such as bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease ( ), highlight the relevance of basal ganglia interactions for tics. Additional cortical and subcortical systems are also implicated in the general expression of TS, including regions supporting motor planning and preparation, executive function, somatosensation and perception ( ,  ,  ). \n\nAlthough there are multiple reported functional differences of neural activity in TS, many are not explicitly linked to expression of particular symptoms. For example, in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm, children and adults with TS show widespread alterations in activity across distributed anatomical areas compared to controls, suggesting non-specific changes in somatosensory gating ( ,  ). In studies examining motor inhibition, of particular relevance to tic suppression, TS patients show functional differences in motor control and motor execution regions ( ,  ), yet it is difficult to determine if these reflect disruption or enhancement of inhibitory control, and may be obfuscated by participants with heterogeneous developmental courses and comorbid ADHD ( ). Finally, abnormal neural activation is reported for TS individuals during simple motor tasks ( ,  ), during mentalization (theory of mind) ( ,  ), and during emotional face perception ( ). However, abnormalities are not consistent: for example, in one study, no differences were observed between adolescents with TS and controls during tests spanning cognitive and motor domains ( ). \n\nTaken together, these findings indicate that functional neuroanatomical differences associated with TS are perhaps subtle, yet extend beyond motor circuitry into neural substrates supporting many domains of cognitive function. Specific functional differences may relate to the core symptoms of tics and premonitory sensations ( ), or reflect facets of common comorbidities ( ), distinct developmental trajectories ( ), or even dysfunction impacting multiple neural systems, such as a tendency towards cortical hyperexcitability ( ). Historically, the assimilation of disparate results from functional neuroimaging studies on TS populations is challenging on account of substantial participant heterogeneity in tic experience, lifespan expression, comorbidity rate, and medication usage ( ). One examination of convergent activations specifically related to tic generation, response inhibition, and voluntary motor execution identified the SMA, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex ( ). However, beyond these specific phenomenological aspects of TS, the different functional systems in which there are potential differences between TS and control populations are reflected in the different cognitive tasks applied by functional imaging studies, and in the neuroanatomical distribution of identified functional changes that extend beyond canonical CSTC networks ( ,  ). \n\nIn the current study, we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the existing neuroimaging literature of task-based fMRI studies in TS populations. We conducted a series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses ( ,  ) to improve statistical power compared to a single study, and capitalize upon evidence from studies with different sample characteristics and experimental designs, to elucidate common neurobiological substrates related to TS. \n\nWe first tested for group differences between TS and control participants in neural activation, across cognitive domains. Next, given the mixed comorbidity samples employed in the literature, we determined which patterns of functional neural reactivity specifically relate to tics (as core TS symptoms), by examining association between neural activations and tic severity score, across the various experimental tasks employed. This combined approach provides an overview of the existing task-based neuroimaging data on TS, and further pinpoints specific functional neuroanatomy alterations that are central to TS, beyond comorbidities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nA literature search on PubMed ( ) was conducted using the following search terms: \u201cTourette\u201d OR \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Only studies that met the following inclusion criteria were considered for analysis:   \nOriginal data are presented (thus, review papers were excluded), \n  \nTourette Syndrome sample was examined (excluding studies on patients with secondary tics after e.g. traumatic brain injury, stroke, encephalitis, and patients with Tourette-like symptoms called Tourettisms), \n  \nStudy included a control group and reports TS vs control contrast(s), \n  \nMethods include task-related fMRI or H2O-PET (excluding e.g. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), behavioral only, and non-task-related fMRI studies such as resting-state fMRI), \n  \nParticipants were not subjected to treatment therapies as part of the experimental manipulation (e.g. deep brain stimulation (DBS) or drug infusion; exception: behavioral therapy), \n  \nWhole-brain analysis was conducted (excluding studies reporting only region of interest (ROI) analyses), \n  \nPeak activation coordinates are reported, \n  \nStudy was conducted with human participants, \n  \nArticle was originally published in English. \n  \n\n provides a detailed illustration of the literature selection process.   \nFlow chart describing the literature selection process. Number of publications (n) and number of individuals (N) are indicated. *We tested all combinations of search terms \u201cTourette\u201d, \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d, \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d, \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Searches other than those indicated in the figure did not provide additional results. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAs of January 2017, fourteen publications met inclusion criteria for the first ALE analysis examining differences between TS and control participants (see Supplementary Table 1 for references). If otherwise suitable studies did not report activation coordinates, we contacted the authors by e-mail. However, all enquiries remained unsuccessful. Likewise, we contacted the authors of three papers who did not report the age range of the participants ( ,  ,  ) to request these. This information was available for one study ( ). The age of the participants from the other two studies ( ,  ) is therefore described with the mean and standard deviation, as reported within the original publications. The following information was recorded for each study: first author and year of publication, neuroimaging method (fMRI/H2O-PET), task domain, brief task description and contrast(s) entered to the ALE, sample size of TS and control groups, age range of TS participants (in all studies, case and control participants were age-matched), number of TS participants with comorbid OCD and ADHD, and their medication status ( ). Notably, if two studies presented different data acquired from the same sample, both were included as separate experiments ( ,  ).   \nStudies included in the ALE meta-analysis examining differences in activations between TS participants and controls. \n  Table 1       \n\nTwo studies ( ,  ) found no difference between the TS and control groups and were thus entered into the meta-analysis with no coordinates. Three other studies ( ,  ,  ) conducted an ANOVA analysis, and we selected information equivalent to the TS vs control contrast from reported main effects and interactions. Interactions were only used if the direction of the effect was clearly described, and relevant to group differences. For example, in a study of prepulse inhibition in TS and control participants, a reported Task\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interaction reflected activation differences between TS and control groups for the contrast of PPI trials compared to \u2018pulse alone\u2019 trials ( ). In addition, some articles provided more than one analysis comparing TS and control participants. For example, in a study of finger tapping, TS and control participants were compared on finger tapping with the right hand in one analysis, and on finger tapping with the left hand in another ( ). These contrasts were included in the meta-analysis as separate experiments. Contrasts examining decreases [TS\u00a0<\u00a0control] and increases [TS\u00a0>\u00a0control] in activation for the TS group were pooled and included in one experiment as [TS vs control]. The final selection of publications provided 25 experiments, 311 foci, and a total of 651 participants. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: TS vs controls group difference \n  \nFirst, we examined differences in activations between TS participants and controls. The meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.3.6. ( ). The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm treats the reported foci of included studies as spatial probability distributions centered on the given coordinates ( ,  ). The width of the distribution depends on empirical estimates of between-subject and between-template variability, also accounting for the sample size of each experiment. Further, a \u2018modelled activation\u2019 (MA) map is computed by merging the probability distributions of all foci reported in the respective experiment. The ALE image is then produced by taking the union of all MA maps in a voxel-wise manner. The algorithm subsequently searches for above-chance convergence of activation probabilities between experiments. This allows for a random-effect analysis, as opposed to considering between-foci convergence that would produce a fixed-effects analysis, thereby permitting generalization of the results to experiments not included in the meta-analysis. Finally, the results are tested against a null distribution that assumes random spatial association between experiments. Our approach therefore followed the details of established ALE methodology ( ). \n\nStereotactic brain coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using Talairach to MNI (SPM) conversion as implemented in GingerALE. Default settings were used with the exception of setting the ALE Method to \u201cTurkeltaub Non-Additive\u201d, which controls within-experiment effects by limiting probability values of neighboring foci from the same experiment. This is achieved using the maximum probability associated with a given focus (as opposed to using the union of the probabilities) for computing the MA map ( ). The ALE map was thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected with a minimum cluster volume of 100\u00a0mm  ( ,  ). The ALE map was displayed using MRIcron ( ), and anatomical labeling was guided by the Anatomy toolbox 2.2b ( ) for SPM12 ( ,  ), and the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas ( ) in FSL ( ). \n\n#### TS vs controls group difference: additional task-based studies employing region of interest (ROI) approaches \n  \nFour studies that otherwise met inclusion criteria employed an ROI analysis method whereby the whole-brain effect of task, for both TS and control participants, was used to define a \u2018task ROI\u2019 to which a small volume correction was applied when interrogating the group difference between TS and control participants. These four studies therefore did not meet our strict inclusion criteria in that they do not perform a whole-brain analysis when comparing the TS group to controls. However, we acknowledge the contribution of these studies to the published literature on TS. We therefore conducted an exploratory ALE meta-analysis that incorporated these additional four studies, including contrasts that examined the group difference within task ROIs. These additional four studies are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 and references listed in Supplementary Table 3. All ALE procedures were the same as for the primary group difference analysis (above). The results did not substantially change the clusters in the resulting ALE map (Supplementary Table 5) and therefore will not be further discussed. \n\n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: tic severity \n  \nWe next examined the relationship between activations and tic severity in TS. We conducted a second ALE meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies that reported activation coordinates for correlations with tic severity in TS participants. Suitable studies were identified using the aforementioned inclusion criteria (see  ). We discarded all criteria regarding the control group, as they bare no relevance to symptom severity analyses. As a result, 7 fMRI publications ( ) met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, one of which ( ) found no correlation with symptom severity, and was thus used with no coordinates. Together, these articles provided information about 8 experiments with 23 foci and 378 participants. All studies measured tic severity with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

Furthermore, we tested for task activation patterns that specifically relate to core TS symptoms, by examining correlations with tic severity within TS patients. Group differences were identified in functional systems including prefrontal and motor preparation areas; sensory-perceptual (somatosensory and visual) areas; and parieto-temporal association cortices. Importantly, however, only prefrontal and motor preparation regions predicted tic severity, suggesting specificity of task-based neural reactivity within these areas to the core symptomatology of TS. \n\nThese results support a core dysfunction of CSTC motor loops in TS that specifically underpins the expression of tics ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, more generalized CSTC dysfunction may account for alterations across neuroanatomical systems predisposing individuals to the heterogeneity of intrinsic symptoms and the multifaceted nature of neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities within the TS spectrum ( ,  ). \n\n### Anatomically widespread alterations in neural function in TS \n  \nThe neuroimaging studies of TS included in the meta-analyses were task-based studies that represented multiple experimental paradigms across cognitive domains. These included motor execution tasks, for example finger tapping ( ,  ,  ,  ), motor inhibition tasks, for example the stop signal and Go/No-Go tasks ( ,  ), executive function challenges, for example the Stroop task ( ,  ), probes of somatosensory gating, for example the prepulse (PPI) inhibition paradigm ( ,  ), theory of mind tasks ( ,  ), and responses to emotional faces ( ). These neuroimaging investigations highlight the diversity of cognitive processes that are putatively altered in TS, which our first meta-analysis demonstrates are correspondingly reflected in differences in neural function, distributed anatomically across multiple neural systems. \n\nTics are fundamentally motor symptoms, and several motor execution and inhibition studies were included in the meta-analysis. We therefore anticipated that evidence for motor circuit dysfunction would be identified: specifically, the meta-analysis highlighted cortical dysregulation within the motor preparation regions SMA and premotor cortex. We discuss the implications for understanding the dysfunction of these regions in reference to the tic severity ALE analysis in  . \n\nThe analysis of group differences also highlighted prefrontal clusters, encompassing all three frontal gyri. A high proportion of the included studies tested patients with comorbid ADHD and/or OCD, in which prefrontal dysfunction and associated executive deficits are likely core elements ( ,  ,  ). Thus, these prefrontal clusters may in part reflect the presence of, or predisposition to, these comorbid conditions in TS individuals. \n\nSomatosensory features are important elements to the general experience of TS. Premonitory sensations frequently precede tics ( ,  ). These are often described as feelings of \u2018itch\u2019 or \u2018pressure\u2019, and typically show a somato-homuncular coupling to the bodily location at which the tic subsequently emerges ( ). Our meta-analysis confirmed differences in the functional reactivity of somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus) in TS compared to controls, indicating how somatomotor control through cortico-cortical interaction might underpin the experiential expression of TS. \n\nHowever, it is notable that the insula was not identified. Although the task-based studies included in our analysis did not explicitly test the neurobiological mechanisms of premonitory phenomena, the insula has been proposed as a core site of sensory symptom generation ( ,  ,  ), and structural neuroimaging has confirmed severity of premonitory phenomena is associated with both somatosensory and insular cortices ( ,  ). It is possible that while the insula is indeed a likely generator of sensory symptoms, it was not detected in our meta-analyses because task-based studies of TS to date have not typically employed paradigms testing bodily processing that are likely to activate the insula, such as interoceptive tasks ( ). Regardless of task nature, however, it would be useful if future task-based fMRI studies reported sensory symptom severity associations, as many studies in the existing literature do for tic severity, so that future meta-analyses can confirm if functional reactivity of the insula, alongside somatosensory cortex, are associated with this dimension of TS symptom expression. Of note, one resting-state fMRI study has already indicated that strength of insula interactions with SMA is associated with premonitory phenomena severity ( ). \n\nSensorimotor coupling and the priming of motor responses by sensation extends beyond proprioception and touch. Although the processing and representation of visual information has rarely been studied in TS, several visual processes appear to operate differently. Visual field ( ) and colour vision ( ) deficits are both described in TS. Interestingly, the group difference analysis identified a cluster within lingual gyrus in the region of the colour perception area, V4. In addition, there are indications that perception of complex visual stimuli, namely facial expressions, is altered in TS. Participants with TS may show greater amygdala activation to emotional faces ( ), a possible driver for echopraxic facial tics, which more generally, highlights the influence of salient environmental stimuli on the sensitivity of people with TS to potential stressors ( ), including social emotional cues. Furthermore, a tendency for people with TS to engage in mental state reasoning, even when not explicitly required, may also promote greater neural reactivity in response to social and emotional cues ( ). While our meta-analysis cannot explicitly test for such mechanisms, group differences were observed across temporo-parietal areas implicated in own bodily self-consciousness, perception of others, and perspective taking; these included the posterior superior temporal sulcus, the supramarginal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOur first analysis demonstrated the presence of differences in cortical reactivity in TS, distributed across anatomically widespread neural systems. These differences may account for the wider set of cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms of the TS spectrum. Moreover it remains plausible that, in TS, a common process affecting cortical reactivity (e.g. compromised CSTC control) underpins these observations, with variable expression beyond the critical impact on tics. We therefore focused next on patterns of brain reactivity that might underpin the specific experience of tics in TS. \n\n\n### Tic severity is specifically associated with prefrontal and premotor activity \n  \nRegardless of comorbidities, developmental stage, or medication status, one symptom that all individuals with TS have in common is the expression of tics. We therefore performed an ALE meta-analysis to determine which regions show a specific relationship between task activity and tic severity. A subset of premotor and prefrontal regions, encompassing the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and middle frontal gyrus were identified, indicating that the greater participants' tic severity, the greater the functional alterations in these regions. This corroborates the role of the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex in CSTC circuit dysfunction in TS ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, these data demonstrate the close relationship between prefrontal cortex function and tic expression, which may relate to inhibitory tic suppression strategies ( ), and influence the degree of plasticity in adaptive prefrontal regulation of motor responses ( ,  ). The importance of SMA and prefrontal cortex for tic generation, tic suppression, and voluntary action was highlighted by   in an examination of activation clusters related to these particular phenomenological aspects of TS. \n\nInterestingly, we did not observe any clusters within subcortical regions within this meta-analysis. Basal ganglia nuclei clearly play a role in tic expression ( ,  ) and are altered in structural morphology ( ,  ). The thalamus also has a critical role within CSTC circuitry ( ), and is a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation ( ). In addition, there is evidence for TS-related structural and functional differences of the amygdala ( ,  ). That these subcortical structures were not identified in either the group difference or tic severity ALE analyses may reflect methodological insensitivity and the focus on task-based activation studies. Firstly, the particular subtractions used in these task-based studies may be less sensitive towards subcortical responses in whole-brain analyses. Secondly, although several studies employed paradigms relating to motor function, such as finger tapping, they did not examine symptom expression per se, other than broad correlations with tic severity. Thirdly, neurovascular coupling and the BOLD response differ in cortical and subcortical brain areas, with the result that neuroimaging studies may be more sensitive to group differences in cortical areas in general ( ,  ). Finally, the ALE methodology itself employs assumptions which may diminish the sensitivity of the analysis to detect results in subcortical regions (see   below). \n\n\n### ALE limitations \n  \nIn establishing the pool of appropriate studies from the current TS neuroimaging literature for meta-analysis inclusion, a number of issues became apparent that have implications for the interpretation of our ALE results. We applied stringent selection criteria, requiring all studies to have conducted whole-brain analyses, report peak co-ordinates, and employed both a TS and a control group. Despite the burgeoning number of task-based neuroimaging investigations of TS, unfortunately, many did not meet these basic criteria: most often, authors had not reported whole-brain investigations, and instead reported only group differences within pre-selected ROIs, negating the opportunity for the data to contribute to a meta-analysis, as this would a priori bias probability distributions produced by GingerALE towards the ROI foci. \n\nThis has two important implications. Firstly, our results do not encompass the entirety of available literature. Secondly, there appears to be a methodological tendency in a portion of task-based investigations of TS to examine specific regions-of-interest assumed to be of relevance for TS, or known to be important for the task. This contrasts with the use of whole-brain analyses that report which regions reach criterion threshold. The impact on meta-analytic investigations is that if non-significant whole-brain results are not reported, we are unable to enter that study to ALE analysis with zero co-ordinates. Thus, the group differences that we identify may be inflated. Therefore, even when ROIs are selected in clear relevance to the participant group and paradigms employed, we suggest it is helpful for future interpretation, and the pursuit of meta-analytic insights, that authors consistently report whole-brain statistical tests \u2013 even if non-significant \u2013 alongside ROI data. \n\nThe fact that (significant) whole-brain analyses are not more frequently reported may also reflect the subtle nature of differences in brain function in the neurodevelopmental disorder TS, when compared to neurodegenerative disorders (such as Parkinson's disease,  ). Indeed, beyond task-based fMRI investigations ( ,  ,  ), neuroimaging studies of TS have not always revealed significant differences, including voxel-based morphology (VBM) studies of brain morphology ( ,  ,  ); PET studies of striatal dopamine binding potential ( ,  ), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of GABA concentration ( ). This inconsistency in findings may be partly explained by heterogeneity of TS samples, including differences in sample size and variability in patient characteristics, in addition to differences in MRI hardware and methodology ( ). \n\nThe application of meta-analyses can provide powerful overviews of disparate literature. However, to draw robust conclusions, the extent of contributing literature matters. For task-based fMRI data analysed with GingerALE, in general, a sample size of approximately 20 studies is likely to yield sufficient power for moderate effects ( ). In our sample size of 14 studies, we identified multiple clusters of differences and effects in TS. However, these did not reach significance at the most conservative thresholds for multiple comparisons correction. We therefore present our results with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, we identified an additional 7 studies that did not meet our stringent inclusion criterion for whole-brain analyses, and a further 6 studies that did not report activation coordinates. To test the impact of some of these otherwise eligible studies, we performed an additional exploratory analysis in which we included four task-ROI studies. Importantly, however, our results were not substantially different. Greater power and interpretive insight than was possible at present will benefit from future reporting of neuroimaging results within the TS literature at whole-brain thresholds, alongside more detailed reporting of clinical severity associations such as premonitory phenomena. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nFuture neuroimaging studies should carefully consider the complex presentation of TS, as the large proportion of individuals with comorbid disorders ( ) may bias comparisons to unaffected participants ( ,  ). The direct comparison of \u2018pure\u2019 TS patients, TS participants with comorbidities, and control participants, will be of particular value, yet requires sufficient sample sizes. Medication status is another important aspect which should similarly be dealt with, by comparisons between medicated and medication-free patients, given that medication can modulate cognitive function and behavior ( ). Even in the case of smaller, mixed samples, the accurate reporting of the presence and severity of comorbidities will refine interpretation across the imaging literature. \n\nAn increased interest in resting-state fMRI studies of TS is apparent, as is evident in publications from 2014 to 2015 ( ). However, our examination of the current fMRI literature on TS highlights the need for further task-related fMRI, reporting whole-brain results, to provide unique data on evoked neural reactivity that can complement and inform the interpretation of resting-state functional connectivity datasets. The constrained use of ROI analysis can be valuable for testing specific hypotheses regarding putative neural mechanisms, yet the approach can lead to an overrepresentation of selected brain regions within the literature, and underrepresentation of others ( ). This circumvents the ideal application of meta-analytic approaches, since ROI studies introduce a priori increases in the likelihood of identified foci. Finally, network analysis methods, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM) ( ), permit greater insight into mechanistic pathways of dysfunction beyond increases or decreases in regional activity. These approaches hold the potential for unveiling network integration changes, even if no activation differences are found within individual nodes of the network ( ,  ). Thus, even if only subtle univariate results are observed, it is possible to reveal disorder-specific effects. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nUsing GingerALE meta-analysis, we found differences in neural activity in TS across multiple regions of neocortex, encompassing motor, somatosensory, and perceptual systems. However, only premotor and prefrontal areas were specific to the core expression of tics in TS. This accords with models of CSTC circuit dysfunction as fundamentally underpinning aspects of TS. The heterogeneity of TS, and methodological limitations within the existing task-based neuroimaging literature, invite future investigations to carefully delineate their sample populations and analysis reports. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 5554925, "text_md5": "1fbd5ea93ccc72342bb3006019686809", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 63], "journal": [64, 79], "publication_year": [81, 85], "title": [96, 233], "keywords": [247, 367], "abstract": [380, 2829], "body": [2838, 38816]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 28831377, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2017.08.004", "pmcid": "5554925", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554925", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5554925"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554925\">5554925</a>", "list_title": "PMC5554925  Centrality of prefrontal and motor preparation cortices to Tourette Syndrome revealed by meta-analysis of task-based neuroimaging studies"}

However, a detailed understanding of the neural regions implicated in the disorder remains incomplete because of considerable variability in findings across studies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify consistent patterns of neural activity across neuroimaging study designs in PTSD to improve understanding of the neurocircuitry of PTSD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted a literature search for PET and fMRI studies of PTSD that were published before February 2011. The article search resulted in 79 functional neuroimaging PTSD studies. Data from 26 PTSD peer-reviewed neuroimaging articles reporting results from 342 adult patients and 342 adult controls were included. Peak activation coordinates from selected articles were used to generate activation likelihood estimate maps separately for symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies of PTSD. A separate meta-analysis examined the coupling between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity in patients. \n\n\n##  Results  \n  \nResults demonstrated that the regions most consistently hyperactivated in PTSD patients included mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and when ROI studies were included, bilateral amygdala. By contrast, widespread hypoactivity was observed in PTSD including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus. Furthermore, decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity was associated with increased amygdala activity. \n\n\n##  Conclusions  \n  \nThese results provide evidence for a neurocircuitry model of PTSD that emphasizes alteration in neural networks important for salience detection and emotion regulation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n##  Background  \n  \nIn the aftermath of highly distressing and shocking events such as combat, genocide, and rape, a subset of individuals develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by distressing memories of the event, physiological hyperarousal, and impairment in daily functioning. With the growing interest in PTSD due in part to its high prevalence among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there is an urgency to understand the neural pathogenesis of the disorder. Neuroimaging studies have been conducted to examine brain regions involved in PTSD [ - ]. Based on these findings and the non-human animal literature, the prevailing neurocircuitry model of PTSD suggests that PTSD can be understood in terms of circuits involved in fear conditioning in the brain. Specifically, this model suggests that heightened amygdala activity gives privileged status to feared and threatening stimuli. Whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex would normally temper amygdala activity, abnormal function of this region reduces regulation of amygdala output [ ]. Furthermore, altered hippocampal function may result in impaired ability to discern safe from dangerous contexts. \n\nThe aforementioned brain regions, which play a key role in nonhuman animal fear conditioning [ ], likely play an important role in PTSD. PTSD is more likely to develop following highly fear-provoking and life-threatening events than less intense events [ ]. Influential psychological theories of PTSD have emphasized the role of fear structures and fear conditioning in the development and maintenance of the disorder [ , ]. Furthermore, exposure therapy, which involves the principles of extinction learning [ ], is one of the most effective therapeutic interventions for PTSD. \n\nHowever, fear conditioning models are limited in their ability to explain the full range of human experience and emotion. Fear conditioning can occur outside of conscious awareness, yet conscious processes such as voluntary and effortful avoidance of thoughts and memories of the trauma play a vital role in the development and maintenance of the disorder [ ]. This has led to growing supposition that fear-circuitry models are unable to fully account for the heterogeneity of symptoms following a traumatic event [ ] and that anxiety and fear may not be the central components in explaining PTSD symptomatology as previously believed [ ]. Accordingly, the proposed revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) may now recognize negative cognitions and persistent negative mood states as key symptoms of the diagnosis [ ], suggesting that other emotions such as dysphoria are important in the development and maintenance of the disorder in addition to fear. Therefore, a primary goal of the present study was to examine patterns of brain activation in neuroimaging studies of PTSD that may provide a more complete understanding of the neural circuitry of PTSD. \n\nIn the present study, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies in PTSD using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). This method calculates the probability that a given voxel is activated consistently across studies rather than a single study [ ] and therefore provides a more objective measure of brain activity in PTSD than qualitative reviews. Although there have been two prior functional neuroimaging meta-analyses in PTSD [ , ], the present study includes more recent studies, focuses solely on adult PTSD, and considers separately the effects of study type (symptom provocation versus cognitive-emotional) and neuroimaging analysis type (whole-brain voxel-wise analysis versus region-of-interest [ROI] analysis). Symptom provocation studies are designed to elicit trauma-related symptoms whereas cognitive-emotional studies include emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful face) but do not explicitly cue the patient to their traumatic event. In contrast to previous meta-analyses in PTSD, the current study separates symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies to examine the neural correlates of two primary characteristics of PTSD: specific recall of a traumatic event (symptom provocation) and emotional response generalization (cognitive-emotional studies). Furthermore, examining results from whole-brain voxel-wise analyses separately from ROI analyses may provide greater insight whether the regions typically targeted in ROI studies (e.g., the amygdala) are also robustly active when taking into account all voxels in the brain. ROI analyses restrict statistical analysis to the small number of a priori defined voxels, reducing the need for more stringent correction for multiple comparisons; thus, ROI studies are not entirely comparable to studies employing whole-brain voxel-wise statistics. In the present study, we examined the results from ROI studies as they comprise a significant proportion of imaging studies in PTSD, with the recognition that whole brain voxel-wise analyses represent a less biased statistical approach. Finally, we performed a separate meta-analysis to test the fear-model hypothesis that hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is associated with hyperactivity in the amygdala, reflecting insufficient inhibition of prefrontal cortex over the amygdala. \n\n\n##  Methods  \n  \n###  Article selection  \n  \nUsing keywords \u201cPTSD,\u201d \u201cneuroimaging,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d and \u201cPET,\u201d a literature search in PubMed and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) was conducted for PET and fMRI studies of adult PTSD that were published before February 2011. The article search resulted in 79 functional neuroimaging studies. Included studies contrasted a traumatic or negative emotional condition with a resting baseline, positive condition, or neutral condition, conducted between-group analyses using subtraction methodology, and reported between-group peak activation coordinates in standard space. For relevant articles that did not report whole-brain results, the authors were contacted to request activation coordinates [ , ]. Case studies were excluded [ , ] as well as studies examining PTSD and co-morbidity with other disorders, although an exception was made for major depressive disorder (MDD) because of its high co-morbidity with PTSD [ ]. Based on these inclusion and exclusion criteria, 26 adult PTSD neuroimaging studies reporting results from 342 patients and 342 controls remained in the analyses (see Table  ). \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging studies included in meta-analysis \n  \n*  TC  : trauma exposed controls without PTSD. **  NTC  : non-traumatized controls. \n\n SA  : sexual abuse/assault;   PA  : physical abuse/assault;   MVA  : motor vehicle accident;   NSA  : non sexual assault;   IPV  : intimate partner violence. \n  \n\n###  Inclusion/exclusion criteria for activation foci  \n  \nFor each of the articles listed in Table  , significant peak activation coordinates were extracted for negative\u2009>\u2009other (baseline, positive, or neutral) between-group contrasts (PTSD\u2009>\u2009Controls; Controls\u2009>\u2009PTSD). When coordinates for more than one type of negative\u2009>\u2009other contrast were reported in the same study, only one contrast was included to avoid using foci from the same participants twice [ , , , ]. In these cases, the selected contrast compared a trauma-specific or fear-inducing condition with a neutral condition. If a study conducted a whole-brain and a ROI analysis [ , , , ], coordinates from both analyses were included provided that the ROIs were not reported in the whole-brain results [ , , ]. \n\nIn studies that included two levels of control groups (e.g., healthy controls and trauma-exposed controls) or PTSD patients (e.g., PTSD with MDD versus PTSD without MDD), only foci from one of the between-group comparisons were used (i.e., between-group foci for PTSD vs. traumatized controls [ , ] and PTSD without co-morbidity vs. controls [ ]). Following inclusion and exclusion of coordinates, 218 between-group activation foci remained (Table  ). \n  \nNumber of activation foci included in between-group analyses \n  \n P\u2009>\u2009C  : PTSD patients\u2009>\u2009Controls;   C\u2009>\u2009P  : Controls\u2009>\u2009PTSD patients. \n\n*Paper also reported symptom provocation coordinates. \n\n**Papers also reported whole brain coordinates. \n\n cor.   = corrected for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\n###  Meta-analyses  \n  \nCoordinate-based random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using GingerALE software version 2.1 ( ). Coordinates reported in MNI space were converted to Talairach space using the Lancaster transform [ ] as implemented in GingerALE. Coordinates from symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional tasks were first combined to examine the neural regions involved across tasks and then were analyzed separately to examine differences between the two design types. A replicate set of analyses was performed that included ROI-based studies. Differences in the whole-brain voxel-wise results with the inclusion of ROIs, when present, are noted in the tables and results. \n\nFor each analysis reported, peak activation coordinates were smoothed using a three-dimensional Gaussian filter and transformed into Gaussian probability distributions. These probability distributions were combined to generate whole-brain statistical maps of the ALE values on a voxel-wise basis. ALE statistics calculated the probability that at least one of the foci lay within each voxel and, therefore, the likelihood that each voxel was activated across all studies included in the analysis. The ALE statistic maps were compared with a null-distribution of random spatial associations between experiments (random-effects model) to assess for above chance clustering between experiments using a threshold at false discovery rate (FDR) corrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a cluster-extent of 100\u2009mm . \n\nTo explore the hypothesis that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala was inversely related, we first identified whole-brain studies that reported increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in controls relative to PTSD patients (which would suggest that this region was hypoactive in PTSD) and also reported regions of increased activity in PTSD relative to controls. Six studies were identified that met these criteria [ , , , - ]. A meta-analysis was performed on the coordinates from these studies for the PTSD\u2009>\u2009Control contrast. Thus, we examined the regions that were hyperactive in PTSD when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactive. Due to the small number of studies included, the analysis was thresholded at FDR corrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a less conservative cluster-extent of 40\u2009mm  (i.e., 5 contiguous voxels) was used. \n\n\n\n##  Results  \n  \nSeparate meta-analyses were run to examine the neural activity across and within symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional tasks in PTSD. Because of the variability in naming conventions of medial prefrontal cortex regions across different studies, activated regions are listed in the text and tables both by their structure specific name (e.g., medial frontal gyrus) and a general name signifying their contribution to a broader, less defined area (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex which broadly includes the pregenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex). \n\n###  Common activations for PTSD across tasks  \n  \nThe regions that were hyper- and hypoactive when studies were collapsed across task type (i.e., symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional) in PTSD relative to control subjects are reported in Table  . We defined hyperactivity in PTSD as the results stemming from the PTSD\u2009>\u2009Control contrast and hypoactivity in PTSD as brain regions active from the Control\u2009>\u2009PTSD contrast. Patients with PTSD showed hyperactivation in the mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate (Figure  A), left superior temporal gyrus, and left supplementary motor area. Robust bilateral amygdala and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity was observed when ROI studies were included (Figure  )B. \n  \nBetween-group comparison of activity across symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies \n  \n P  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR-corrected, cluster activation extent\u2009\u2265\u2009100\u2009mm .

When ROI studies were included, the results remained consistent with additional activity observed in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (Table  ). \n\n\n###  Symptom provocation studies  \n  \nA meta-analysis of symptom provocation designs was conducted to reveal the regions that were involved in reliving one\u2019s traumatic event (Table  ). The regions consistently hyperactivated in PTSD were the mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, widespread hypoactivity was observed, including the medial frontal gyrus (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), right inferior frontal gyrus, and right precuneus. These results were unchanged with the inclusion of ROI studies.

The whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed hyperactivity in supplementary motor area. Bilateral amygdala and medial frontal gyrus (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, BA 8) activity was observed when ROI studies were included (see Table  ). Regions of hypoactivity (Figure  ) included the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and medial frontal gyrus (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, BA 9). \n\n\n###  Ventromedial prefrontal cortex meta-analysis  \n  \nWe next performed a meta-analysis on regions that were hyperactive in PTSD within studies that reported decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity (see Methods). The analysis showed that when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactivated, greater amygdala activation was observed in PTSD, supporting the hypothesis that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are inversely related. Other regions that showed increased activity included the right middle and inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and right putamen (Table  ). \n  \nVentromedial prefrontal cortex meta-analysis results \n  \n P  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR-corrected, activation extent\u2009\u2265\u200940\u2009mm .

The results confirmed involvement of a subset of regions implicated in fear-circuitry models of PTSD, including robust hyperactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in PTSD, and an inverse relationship between activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. However, additional regions were found to be hyper- and hypoactive in PTSD, suggesting that a broader view of the neural circuitry of PTSD should be considered. Collapsing across symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies, the whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed hyperactivation of the mid/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus in PTSD. These regions have been previously shown to be part of a putative \u2018salience network\u2019 that processes autonomic, interoceptive, homeostatic, and cognitive information of personal relevance [ , ]. Ultimately, the salience network helps an organism evaluate whether stimuli in the environment should be approached or avoided. Importantly, activity in this salience network is positively correlated with anxiety [ ]. We propose that in PTSD, the behavioral manifestation of increased output of the salience network may provide privileged cognitive resources to a broad range of salient stimuli leading to hypervigilance and disruption of goal-directed activity. This notion is consistent with observations in PTSD patients of deficits in working memory for not only trauma-related negative distractors, but also neutral distractors [ ], suggesting that a variety of stimuli become potentially salient for patients with PTSD. From this viewpoint, negative emotions other than fear can be associated with the disorder, as long as they are salient and associated with a stress response. \n\nThe dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is a key node in the salience network. Earlier conceptualizations of the region suggested that its role was primarily in \u201ccold\u201d cognitive processes, in contrast to the ventral aspects of the anterior cingulate cortex that were thought to be involved in affective processing [ ]. However, more recent data have not corroborated a cognitive versus affective dissociation. Recent reviews have called attention to the involvement of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in PTSD [ , ], which may subserve learned fear, fear appraisal and expression, and sympathetic activity [ ]. More broadly, dorsomedial prefrontal regions (including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) have been associated with appraisal and evaluation whereas ventromedial prefrontal regions are associated with regulatory functions. This dissociation is consistent with the findings reported here, where more dorsal prefrontal regions, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and mid/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were active in patients with PTSD and may suggest heightened appraisals of potential threats in the environment, whereas hypoactivity in ventromedial prefrontal regions may reflect dysfunction in emotion regulation. \n\nInterestingly, the present results highlight the contribution of the mid-cingulate in PTSD, adding to the growing evidence that this region plays an important role in this disorder [ - ] and may be important for fear conditioning [ ]. The dorsal anterior cingulate spans a large area, encompassing BAs 24, 32, and 33. Whereas a more anterior portion of the dorsal anterior cingulate was activated in both PTSD patients and control subjects in the present meta-analysis, a more posterior region was hyperactivated only in PTSD. A previous study demonstrated that individuals with severe PTSD symptomatology activated the mid/dorsal anterior cingulate to a greater extent than controls during an emotional oddball task, suggesting that distracting stimuli are given attentional preference at the expense of a goal-relevant task in PTSD [ ]. These findings provide converging evidence for the role of the mid/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in salience processing. Another region in the salience network, the amygdala, was observed only when using a less stringent spatial extent in the whole-brain analysis or when considering ROI analyses. The amygdala is notoriously difficult to image due to vulnerability to susceptibility artifact and its relatively small volume, which could account for lack of robust findings in the whole-brain analysis. Alternatively, it is possible that the amygdala is not as central of a region in PTSD as current neurocircuitry models suggest, consistent with previous meta-analysis data showing that the amygdala is more frequently active in patients with social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than PTSD [ ]. \n\nWith the addition of ROI analyses, amygdala activity was observed for cognitive-emotional tasks but not symptom provocation tasks, suggesting that the type of task employed within a study influences amygdala activity in PTSD. There is emerging recognition that the amygdala may play a more general role in processing ambiguous and salient stimuli in the environment [ - ], of which fear may be one particularly potent instance. The amygdala, which is composed of several distinct but highly interconnected nuclei, is not specific to fear states but is also activated for unusual and novel stimuli [ ] and unpredictability [ ]. Therefore, the stimuli and study designs employed during cognitive-emotional studies of PTSD, which often present novel and ambiguous stimuli intermittently, may evoke more central involvement of the amygdala than autobiographical trauma scripts, which were often familiar and unambiguous from the start. Other explanations for the lack of amygdala activity in symptom provocation designs are less likely. Both the symptom provocation designs and the cognitive-emotional ROI studies (in which amygdala activity was observed most robustly) were block designs; therefore, the results are unlikely to be attributable to differences in neuroimaging experimental design (i.e., event-related vs. block designs). Furthermore, the majority of both symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies were fMRI rather than PET, suggesting that the difference is not due to imaging modality. The discrepancy in amygdala activity for cognitive-emotional and symptom provocation studies underscores the importance of considering the cognitive task when interpreting activation differences (or lack thereof) in the amygdala in PTSD and control participants. \n\nIn the present study, widespread hypoactivity in prefrontal cortex in PTSD was observed, including both medial and lateral regions. Notably, hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was present in both symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional study designs. To examine the relationship between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, we performed a meta-analysis that identified regions of hyperactivity within a subset of studies that showed a decrease in ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in PTSD patients. We reasoned that under conditions of diminished ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity, which may signify reduced top-down governance of interconnected regions, we would observe greater amygdala activity. The results showed that when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactive, the amygdala, putamen, and temporal cortex were hyperactivated. These results support the notion that a consequence of hypoactivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be greater responsivity of the amygdala in the face of negative information. Although the direction of this effect cannot be determined conclusively because the neural connections between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are bidirectional, there is a well-established literature showing the involvement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in regulatory control across species [ ]. It is important to note that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is not a single entity, but rather is composed of multiple distinct regions (i.e., subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, medial portions of orbitofrontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus) that subserve a variety of functions. For instance, the non-human animal literature suggests that bordering divisions within ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be responsible for both inhibition and facilitation of autonomic arousal [ ]. This may help to explain why some studies of PTSD show increased activation in this region [ ] and suggests that a more fine-grained analysis is required to better elucidate the various functions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Nevertheless, the results of the current meta-analysis show robust hypoactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex consistent across task type, underscoring its hypothesized role in regulatory control. \n\nImportantly, additional prefrontal cortex regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus were hypoactivated in PTSD. This finding is notable as previous work has implicated the role of inferior frontal gyrus in emotion regulation, including inhibition from emotional distraction [ ] and emotional thought suppression [ ]. Moreover, the inferior frontal gyrus is purported to be involved in a network of lateral prefrontal cortex regions involved in changing one\u2019s negative thoughts to reduce the impact of negative feelings (i.e., cognitive reappraisal) [ ]. Although speculative, it is possible that decreased activity in lateral prefrontal cortex may reflect PTSD patients\u2019 difficulty challenging negative thoughts to cope with emotional stimuli. Contemporary psychological models of PTSD highlight the role of negative appraisals and emotion regulation in the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. One of the most successful psychosocial interventions for PTSD, cognitive processing therapy, is based upon the notion that faulty cognitions and interpretation surrounding the traumatic event interferes with the natural recovery process after a trauma [ ]. For example, a female rape victim who misattributes blame to herself for attending a party where the rape occurred may then mistrust her decisions in every aspect of her life, leading to experiential avoidance and withdrawal from social relationships. Research has supported the notion that negative self-appraisals are associated with PTSD symptom maintenance [ ] and therefore the DSM-V may now include the presence of negative cognitions as a core feature of the disorder [ ]. Cognitive processing therapy encourages the patient to adopt a more balanced view of the circumstances surrounding the traumatic event, as well as current personal events by challenging negative thoughts. Given the present results, future studies should examine whether individuals who benefitted from cognitive processing therapy recruit the inferior frontal gyrus to a greater extent compared to pre-therapy, as well as compared to individuals who did not benefit from therapy. \n\n###  Limitations  \n  \nA constraint of the current study is the availability of studies that met our criteria for inclusion into the analyses. Although the literature search started with 79 studies, the exclusion of studies that did not include stereotaxic coordinates likely reduced our power to detect less robust activations. Although the number of foci included in this study is more than the minimum recommended for a meta-analysis, it remains an open question whether a larger sample will reveal additional networks central to the PTSD diagnosis. For example, amygdala activity was observed in the PTSD group only when considering ROI analyses or using a less stringent spatial extent. Therefore, the limited number of studies available for the meta-analysis may have had an impact on the ability to detect amygdala activity within the whole-brain analysis. Activity in another key node within the salience network, the anterior insula, was observed in the PTSD group using a less stringent cluster threshold (FDR corrected,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-extent\u2009=\u200924\u2009mm ). Future studies could isolate resting-state networks as a more powerful and robust method towards understanding the functional connections between nodes of the salience network in PTSD. Interestingly, a recent resting-state study in PTSD revealed greater connectivity between the amygdala and insula in patients with PTSD than trauma-exposed controls [ ]. The results are consistent with the notion that key nodes within the salience network are highly coactive in PTSD and may underlie the hallmark symptoms of the disorder. \n\nAlthough there is convincing evidence that the hippocampus becomes dysfunctional as a result of chronic stress [ ] and activity in this region has shown to be negatively correlated with arousal symptoms in PTSD [ ], hippocampal activity was not observed in the present meta-analysis making it unclear how this region contributes to neurocircuitry models of PTSD. Many of the tasks included in this meta-analysis were not optimal for eliciting hippocampal activity and those that do examine hippocampal function in PTSD show mixed results. There is a growing functional neuroimaging literature examining learning and memory in PTSD, which may clarify the role of hippocampus given that these types of paradigms traditionally activate the hippocampus in healthy individuals. \n\nFinally, working with a limited sample required inclusion of studies with patients on medication and/or co-morbid depression. As additional studies are published and software development continues, future meta-analyses may be able to focus exclusively on PTSD or include depression and medication status as covariates in the analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe goal of the present meta-analysis was to examine the neurocircuitry of PTSD by considering a set of studies that were diverse in terms of functional imaging modality, study design, and PTSD trauma type. The results provide evidence for hyperactivation of regions important for vigilance and salience detection, and hypoactivation of regulatory networks engaged in regulation of autonomic arousal and cognition. The key salience network regions that appear to be important in PTSD include the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (including mid/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus. \n\nFurthermore, regulatory control regions include two primary networks that appear to be dysfunctional in PTSD, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex control over the amygdala and lateral prefrontal regions putatively involved in modification of thought and inhibition of distracting emotions. This model is consistent with the findings that therapies designed to both extinguish fear responses and promote emotion regulation through challenging negative cognitions are helpful for the treatment of PTSD. \n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. \n\n\n## Authors\u2019 contributions \n  \nMs. Amanda Mikedis conducted a literature review, performed data analysis, and assisted in writing the Methods section.

FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY AND RISK OF PSYCHOSIS: AN ACTIVATION LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION (ALE) META-ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STUDIES\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nDisrupted communication involving large-scale neural networks is hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, as demonstrated by impaired resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Seed-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in subjects at increased risk of developing psychosis have begun to identify abnormalities in rsFC, although reported findings remain mixed. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of seed-based resting-state fMRI studies to test whether high-risk subjects show rsFC alterations relative to healthy controls within and between the default mode network (DMN), control executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA literature search was performed to identify seed-based resting-state fMRI studies comparing subjects with genetic risk factors, psychotic-like experiences, and clinical high-risk for psychosis to healthy controls. Then, coordinates of seed regions were extracted and categorized into networks by their location within a priori templates. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) analysis examined the reported coordinates for hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity with each a priori network. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe meta-analysis included 15 studies (774 subjects at risk, 628 healthy controls) on clinical high-risk for psychosis, 6 studies (123 subjects at risk, 147 healthy controls) on psychotic-like experiences, and 5 studies (173 subjects at risk, 256 healthy controls) on genetic risk factors of developing psychosis. We found specific patterns of hypo- and hyper-connectivity within and between large-scale networks. Our results showed that subjects with high-risk for psychosis were characterized by hypo-connectivity within the SN and CEN and hyper-connectivity within the DMN and CEN. Network seeds in the DMN, CEN, and SN displayed hyper-connectivity with regions in other networks. The DMN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the CEN, while CEN and SN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the DMN. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis provides evidence that subjects at risk for psychosis present distinctive abnormalities of hyper- and hypo-connectivity within and between the DMN, CEN and SN, particularly implicating network dys-connectivity as a core deficit underlying the psychopathology of psychosis in the preclinical phase. More studies are needed to investigate whether subjects at risk to develop psychosis present patterns of dysfunction between the rsFC of healthy subjects and that of patients with established psychosis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"id": 7234455, "text_md5": "a42e0e5302fd04d67dea26ad44a1567c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 129], "journal": [130, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 318], "keywords": [332, 332], "abstract": [345, 2963], "body": [2972, 2972]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.716", "pmcid": "7234455", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234455", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234455"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234455\">7234455</a>", "list_title": "PMC7234455  T156.

Eating disorder patients commonly suffer several medical complications involving endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal and neurological systems [ ]. Consequently, eating disorders are associated with increased rates of mortality compared with the general population [ ], and individuals with AN have the highest mortality rates of all other psychiatric disorders [ ,  ].\n \n\nAN and BN feature overlapping (such as fixation on weight and appearance) as well as distinct symptoms (such as extreme restriction of calorie intake vs. binging and purging) [ ]. While several factors including sociocultural, psychological and biological aspects have been suggested to contribute to the development and maintenance of these eating disorders, the aetiology is still inconclusive [ ].\n \n\nAnalogous with several other psychiatric illnesses, there has been increasing research surrounding the underlying neurobiological links associated with the contribution and maintenance of eating disorders [ ]. Various neurobiological models have utilised symptom categories to explore the underlying neural correlates, both AN and BN share and what contributes to their differing clinical presentations [ ]. For example, food restriction is a key characteristic of AN, and imbalances in the brain systems involved in emotion, reward processes and decision-making processes, have been implicated in AN presentation [ ]. By contrast, high levels of impulsivity and a lack of inhibition-control leading to binge-eating can be demonstrated in BN, and differences in these neural correlates compared to AN have been suggested [ ,  ]. \n\nReward processing has been proposed to have an integral role in accounting for extreme differences in food intake between individuals presenting with eating disorders [ ]. Individuals with anorexia commonly report anhedonia, an impaired ability to derive pleasure from usually enjoyable activities [ ]. Instead, food restriction is thought to be perceived as initially rewarding, due to weight-related cognitions, and subsequently, sustained due to the conditioning of the reward [ ,  ]. Reduced reward sensitivity has been demonstrated in individuals with AN, with an increased ability to delay monetary rewards for example [ ]. In contrast, individuals with BN report increased novelty seeking and reward sensitivity [ ]. The complex neural mechanisms underlying reward processing employ multiple brain regions [ ] to perform a series of sub-processes, including reward anticipation reward association, re-appraisal of reward value, and reward-seeking behaviour regulation. Key areas are the striatum, predominantly the including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [ ], as well as the amygdala [ ]. \n\nSecond, interoceptive processing refers to the perception of one\u2019s physiological functions, such as fullness, hunger, and taste [ ]. Interoception centers on the anterior insula, through which the peripheral nervous system communicates to the limbic and cortical control centres of homeostasis [ ,  ]. Due to individuals with eating disorders displaying abnormal perceptions of hunger, theories have suggested that impaired interoceptive processing has contributed to the maintenance of their disorders [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nFinally, cognitive control regions are interconnected with both, reward-related regions and areas involved in interoception, and are considered to modulate eating behavior [ ,  ,  ]. Chiefly, the prefrontal cortex, is thought to integrate goals, affective valence, interoceptive states, and sensory input to guide control functions, such as behavioural inhibition, planning and decision making [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Furthermore, the anterior cingulate cortex performs additional executive functions associated with affect-value attribution, emotional regulation, and conflict monitoring [ ]. Finally, the orbitofrontal cortex aids in subjective value attribution and decision making [ ,  ].\n \n\n\n## Using neuroimaging to investigate the mechanisms of eating disorders \n  \nRecent advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed for an increase in research surrounding the underlying neural mechanisms associated with the initiation and maintenance of eating disorders [ ]. Especially, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the most popular neuroimaging tool, has led to substantial advancements in the understanding of neurobiological models of eating disorders [ ]. \n\nWhile the use of fMRI studies to identify neural regions associated with eating disorders has been undoubtedly advantageous, the findings are inherently variable. fMRI studies often use relatively small sample sizes, which can lead to issues with replicability and false positive results [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, inconsistencies between existing fMRI studies investigating eating disorders are not uncommon, which makes drawing conclusion about the neurobiological underpinnings problematic [ ]. \n\nTo address these limitations, coordinate-based meta-analysis can be used. This method statistically establishes concurrence across fMRI studies by pooling activation data [ ,  ]. Pooling data across similar studies allows for increased statistical power, determines inter-study trends, and enables findings occurring by chance to be separated from the consistent results [ ]. One of the most widely used tools for coordinate-based meta-analysis is Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n### Current study \n  \nThe aim of this study was to conduct a systematic ALE meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies to explore the commonalities and differences in brain activation patterns associated with AN and BN, relative to healthy controls (HC). Given the relevance of food for eating disorders, this review focused on task-based fMRI studies that required participants to observe food stimuli. \n\n\n### Hypotheses \n  \n  \nWe hypothesised that when looking at food stimuli, AN patients would show hypoactivity (i.e., reduced activity) in the brain regions related to reward processing, relative to HC. In contrast, we predicted BN patients to show hyperactivity (i.e., increased activity), relative to HC. \n  \nWe hypothesised that when looking at food stimuli, both AN and BN patients would exhibit abnormal activity, relative to HC, in brain regions related to interoceptive processing. \n  \nWe hypothesised that patients with AN would show hyperactivity in brain regions related to cognitive control, while individuals with BN would show hypoactivity, both relative to HC. \n  \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nThe review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items fo Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [ ] (see Fig.  ).   \nPrisma flowchart of search and selection procedure \n  \n\n\n### Search strategy, eligibility criteria and data extraction \n  \nThe electronic databases employed for the search included PsycInfo and PubMed. To identify additional relevant studies, manual searches within the reference lists of examined studies were conducted. All relevant published journal articles, with no year limits were included in the search. The key terms used were (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d) AND (\u201cAnorexia Nervosa\u201d OR \u201cBulimia\u201d OR \"Eating Disorder\u201d). After screening for duplicates, the titles and abstracts and of 631 studies were independently assessed by two reviewers for the following criteria: (a) involving patients with AN or BN in ill state (i.e., not recovered); (b) using task-based fMRI (i.e., no resting-state studies); (c) written in English. This initial screening stage led to the rejection of 451 articles. The full-text of the remaining 180 articles were independently assessed by two reviewers for the following additional criteria: (e) using tasks focused on food stimuli; (f) involving a statistical contrast of a patient sample (AN or BN) relative to a HC sample. This led to the exclusion of a further 164 articles. Finally, two articles were excluded for not reporting activation coordinates (i.e., those two studies used an region of interest-based approach). The final sample of studies comprised, therefore, 14 studies (see Table  ). From those studies two reviewers independently extracted the type of disorder (i.e., AN, BN, and HC), the sample size, the tasks performed, and the fMRI activation coordinates.   \nStudies included ALE meta-analysis \n  \nThe Holsen et al. (2012) study used the DSM-IV weight criterion for AN (i.e.,\u2009<\u200985th percentile of normal body weight). According to the ICD-10 criterion for AN (BMI\u2009\u2264\u200917.5), some patients would be considered weight restored \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nTo identify the commonalities and differences in brain pattern associated with AN and BN, an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis was performed, using GingerALE software Version 3.0.2 [ ,  ,  ]. ALE is a method for conducting coordinate-based meta-analysis to statically analyse the overlap of activation foci from different fMRI studies [ ]. For each included study, the software generates a model activation (MA) map by merging each study\u2019s total foci coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ). Individual MA maps are then combined across studies to form an ALE map. This ALE map provides a statistical map of consistent activations across studies [ ,  ]. To account for risk of bias, GingerALE applies an uncertainty of random effects model. To account for the natural variability across participants spatial smoothing is also applied. That is, the analysis models foci as Gaussian probability distributions, using a Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM), allowing for the smoothing of data over nearby voxels. The distribution width reflects study size, with larger sample sizes weighted more strongly than smaller sample sizes [ ,  ]. To control for the problem of multiple comparisons within the same voxel resulting in false positive clusters, a cluster level FWE threshold was employed [ ]. Specifically, statistical contrasts were computed using a height threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.1 and a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons), based on 1000 permutations, which is considered an optimal thresholding level [ ,  ]. To be able to combine and compare activation patterns form different studies it is necessary to use normalised data within the same stereotaxic space [ ]. The icbm2tal conversation algorithm, as implemented in GingerALE, was used to convert any activation foci reported in Talairach space to MNI space [ ]. To view and display the activation likelihood maps produced by GingerALE coordinates, Mango version 2.5 software was used ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical contrasts \n  \nTo identify how brain patterns associated with viewing food images in AN and BN differ from those in HC, four between group contrast analyses were conducted. (1). Testing for hyperactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in AN relative to HC (AN\u2009>\u2009HC). (2). Testing for hypoactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in AN relative to HC (HC\u2009>\u2009AN). (3). Testing for hyperactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in BN relative to HC (BN\u2009>\u2009HC). (4). Testing for hypoactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in BN relative to HC (HC\u2009>\u2009BN). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Anorexia nervosa vs. healthy controls \n  \nThe analysis was based on nine individual studies and revealed four clusters that showed significantly higher activity in AN patients relative to controls (i.e., hyperactivations related to viewing food images) that were located bilaterally in areas related to cognitive control (i.e., the frontal and cingulate cortex), as well as cerebellum (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). The reverse comparison revealed 11 clusters that showed significantly lower activity in anorexia patients compared to HC (i.e., hypoactivations related to viewing food images). Hypoactivated brain areas included those related to reward processing (i.e., amygdala and striatum) and interoceptive processing (i.e., insula). Additional areas of hypoactivations included the parietal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and lingual gyrus (see Fig.\u00a0 , and Table  ).   \nHyperactivations and Hypoactivations in Patients in AN \n    \nAN hyperactivations and hypoactivation relative to HC \n  \nAnatomical locations and spatial coordinates of ALE analysis showing significant activations (with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) \n\n BA   brodmann area \n  \n\nBrain regions showing hyperactivations (red) and hypoactivations (green) in patients with AN compared to HC.

Hyperactivated brain areas included those related reward processing (striatum), interoception (insula), and visual processing (cuneus, lingual and fusiform gyrus). In addition, there was significant hyperactivity in the bilateral cerebellum) (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table 4). The reverse comparison revealed seven clusters that showed significantly lower activity in BN patients compared to HC (i.e., hypoactivations related to viewing food images). Hypoactivated brain areas included predominantly those related to cognitive control (prefrontal and cingulate cortex). Additional areas of hypoactivations included the precunues and temporal cortex (see Fig.\u00a0 , and Table  ).   \nHyperactivations and Hypoactivations in Patients in BN \n    \nBN hyperactived and hypoactivated brain regions when looking at food images relative to HC \n  \nAnatomical locations and spatial coordinates of ALE analysis showing significant activations (with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) \n\n BA   brodmann area \n  \n\nBrain regions showing hyperactivations (red) and hypoactivations (green) in patients with BN compared to HC; contrasts were computed with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons.

In contrast, BN patients were predicted to show hyperactivity in brain regions related to reward processing. The results of the ALE analysis supported both predictions, by showing decreased activity in amygdala and striatum for the anorexia group and increased striatal activity for the bulimia group. Second, we hypothesized that when looking at food stimuli, both AN and BN patients would exhibit abnormal activity, relative to HC, in brain regions related to interoceptive processing. Again, the results of the ALE analysis supported both predictions, showing decreased insula activity for the anorexia group, and increased activity for the bulimia group. Finally, we hypothesised that patients with AN would show hyperactivity in brain regions related to cognitive control, while individuals with BN would show hypoactivity, both relative to HC. Also here, the ALE analyses supported the predictions; the AN group showed increased activity in cognitive-control-related areas (i.e., prefrontal cortex) relative to the HC group, while the BC group exhibited an inverse pattern (i.e., decreased activity of the prefrontal cortex). \n\nThe first key finding of the ALE analysis was decreased activity in amygdala and striatum for the anorexia group and increased striatal activity for the bulimia group. The amygdala is known to be play a central role in emotional processing [ ] and conditioned learning, such as punishment anticipation and reward learning [ ,  ]. The decreased activity in the anorexia group is, therefore, likely indicative that food rewards are indeed less rewarding. These findings are also in line with fMRI studies focused on gustatory perception which observed reduced amygdala activation in AN patients in response to taste stimuli [ ,  ]. \n\nIn addition, we identified decreased activity in the striatum for the anorexia group and increased activity in the bulimia group. The activation cluster covered both, the ventral and dorsal striatum. The ventral striatum is well known for its role in reward-related behaviour [ ], but also the dorsal striatum is known to respond to reward stimuli [ ], even though it is better known for its role in habit learning [ ]. In addition, the dorsal striatum had been found to mediate behaviours involving eating, particularly of highly palatable, high-calorie foods [ ,  ]. As individuals with AN are known to typically avoid high-calorie foods, whereas bulimia patient embrace it [ ,  ], this in line with the differential brain activity patterns observed in this study. \n\nDistinctions between the two patient groups in terms of reward processing are also indicated by differential activity patterns in visual cortex, i.e., we found decreased activity in anorexia patients and increased activity in bulimia patients, suggesting different degrees of visual attention being paid to food stimuli. Decreased activation in visual processing areas found in AN subjects may indicate they are employing cognitive strategies to show less attention towards the stimuli to support and maintain the anorexic state [ ]. In contrast, BN individuals\u2019 increased engagement towards the food stimuli, together with increased reward processing brain regions, suggests they display a heightened reward sensitivity towards food [ ]. \n\nThe second key finding of our analysis was decreased insula activity for the anorexia group, and increased activity for the bulimia group. Those activity patterns suggest that higher activity relates to greater interoceptive responsiveness, such as increased feelings of hunger or appetite in bulimia patients [ ]. In contrast, the lower-than-normal activity in the anorexia group suggests, therefore, less interoceptive responsiveness to food stimuli [ ], and potentially impaired ability to recognise internal hunger cues [ ,  ]. \n\nFinally, our prediction of brain activity patterns indicative of lower-than-normal cognitive control in the bulimia group, and increased cognitive control in the anorexia group were supported by the ALE results. More specifically, the AN group displayed hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex, inclusion specifically medial and lateral prefrontal areas that form part of the cognitive control network, governing effortful regulation of affective valence, selective attention, and inhibition control [ ,  ,  ]. Increased activity of this network in the AN group is likely to represent a compensatory attempt to exert cognitive control over emotional and reward responses from food stimuli. Overall, these findings suggest an increased responsiveness in terms of monitoring and regulating emotions and food-related motivations, which subsequently lead to restrictive appetitive behavioural responses commonly seen in individuals with AN [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, BN patients displayed hypoactivity in the prefrontal control network, suggesting a decreased responsiveness in terms of monitoring and modulating the emotions and reward-related motivations that the food stimuli may induce [ ]. Therefore, this indicates that individuals with BN have less effective cognitive control, thus allowing for their heightened appetitive and reward systems to impinge, eventually resulting in binge eating behaviours [ ,  ]. Our observations are also in line with studies showing reduced prefrontal activity in individuals with BN during tasks that require (non-food-related) response inhibition tasks [ ,  ]. Furthermore, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the prefrontal cortex has been found to reduce food cravings in women prone to strong food cravings [ ] and to binge eating [ ]. \n\nInterestingly, both AN and BN patients showed hyperactivity in the cerebellum relative to HC. While not directly related to our hypotheses, this finding indicates a functional role for the cerebellum in the control of feeding behaviour. A cluster of nuclei within the cerebellum have been previously shown to have an inhibitory effect on glucose-sensitive neurons within the hypothalamus, suggesting a role in blood glucose homeostasis through regulation of food intake [ ]. Another explanation may lie in the emerging evidence of a role of the cerebellum in the perception and regulation of emotions through its connectivity with the limbic networks [ ]. \n\n### Strength and limits \n  \nTo allow for valid conclusions, quantitative meta-analysis require a high degree comparability and constancy across the included studies. We, therefore, restricted the analysis on studies that involve viewing of food stimuli. While this ensures a high degree of internal consistency and validity it also limits the generalizability of the findings. For instance, our study does not provide insights into other facets of eating disorder, such as those related to body image. Our stringent exclusion criteria also resulted in a relatively low number of included studies (i.e., 14 studies, involving 470 participants) and the results should be, therefore, considered explorative in nature. It is important to note though that pooling data across a relatively small number of studies still has considerable advantages compared to results based on single studies. The evidence base in our analysis was also still sufficiently large to allow for stringent statistical thresholding (i.e., FWE correction), which provides a high level of confidence in the reliability of the results. A larger sample of studies would, however, also permit assessing effects of duration of illness on brain activation patterns. Structural imaging work has indicated that prolonged AN is associated with atrophy specifically in the cerebellum [ ]. Nevertheless, in the current study, the typical duration of illness was comparable for the two disorders (Median \u2009=\u20097.2\u00a0years; Median \u2009=\u20097.5\u00a0years) and is, therefore, not a probable source of bias. \n\nAnother limitation to this study was that the AN sample was not split by restricting and binge-purge subtypes. While the minimum severity BMI criteria is still required for both subtypes of AN [ ], it has been argued that the clinical features of AN binge-purge subtype may align more with BN symptomology in relation to eating behaviours [ ,  ]. While many of the included studies in this meta-analysis reported the importance of considering AN by subtypes, the majority of these studies subsequently did not split their data by subtypes, due to limitations of small sample sizes [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nFinally, while ALE is the most commonly meta-analytical tool for fMRI data, it is not the only approach. Seed-Based Analysis (also known as SDM) is an alternative approach, which in contrast to ALE takes also the effect size of included studies into consideration [ \u2013 ]. It is important to note that differences in meta-analytical approaches might lead to some degree of variability in the outcomes. \n\nDespite this limitation our study provides a valuable summative assessment of the distinct the neural mechanisms underpinning eating disorders, which in turn might guide targeted future interventions, such as neuromodulation approaches treatments [ ]. \n\n\n\n## What is already know on the subject? \n  \nSeveral existing fMRI studies have investigated the neural mechanisms underpinning AN and BN. There is, however, a large degree of variability among the results. \n\n\n## What your study adds? \n  \nUsing an ALE meta-analysis approach, allowed us to identify unique as well as overlapping brain activity for AN and BN relative to HC. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 9556419, "text_md5": "63ca5caddc7c13fd16abf10c9b34644a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 59], "journal": [60, 77], "publication_year": [79, 83], "title": [94, 258], "keywords": [272, 326], "abstract": [339, 2157], "body": [2166, 26672]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35304713, "doi": "10.1007/s40519-022-01390-x", "pmcid": "9556419", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9556419", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9556419"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9556419\">9556419</a>", "list_title": "PMC9556419  Neural correlates associated with processing food stimuli in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}

We undertook systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies in which healthy new mothers were exposed to visual stimuli of own versus other infants to determine the quality of evidence for a dedicated maternal neural network. Systematic literature review revealed a pattern of specific neural responses commonly induced by visual infant paradigms. Brain areas consistently reported as activated in mothers in response to own versus unknown infant included the left thalamus, bilateral pre-central gyrus, left limbic lobe, uncus, amygdala and left caudate. These regions are implicated in reward, attention, emotion processing and other core social cognitive skills. Meta-analysis, however, revealed a more limited subset of brain areas activated in mothers specifically in response to their own versus unknown infant and suggested considerable inter-study variability. Further work is needed if functional imaging is to become an objective tool for the assessment of neural pathways associated with distinct patterns of maternal care behaviour. Such a tool would be invaluable in developing biomarkers of neural activity associated with healthy maternal care and for monitoring treatment/intervention effects of costly parenting interventions. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00737-018-0878-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of seven new mothers listening to sounds of infants crying nearly two decades ago (Lorberbaum et al.  ), this powerful technique has been increasingly employed in an attempt to identify a specific brain circuitry for maternal care behaviour (Swain et al.  ). Using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect, fMRI can indicate which brain areas are being used in response to different conditions\u2014this works on the principle that areas which are more active in response to a particular stimuli will require greater perfusion to meet the demand for oxygen. Squire and Stein ( ) argued that use of fMRI (with a spatial resolution ~\u20093\u20134\u00a0mm; Glover  ) could strengthen our understanding of maternal care behaviour in order to provide much needed insights into its neural basis. \n\n\u2018Maternal sensitivity\u2019 as a construct that involves ability for perception, accurate interpretation and appropriate responsiveness to infant\u2019s signal (Ainsworth et al.  ) is believed to foster secure attachment and promote child\u2019s development. Literature has suggested that variation in maternal sensitivity (i.e. sensitive and less sensitive mothers) is an outcome of interaction between behavioural, social factors that charts a discrete profile of the maternal brain that is mediated by stress- and reward-related neural systems. \n\nIn imaging terms, \u2018maternal responsiveness\u2019 refers to neural brain activation patterns associated with a mother\u2019s response to own infant stimuli. Within clinical settings, observations of maternal-infant interactions by professionals provide useful \u2018snapshots\u2019 that may be helpful in highlighting specific issues requiring extra support. However, due to their very nature, these judgements are quite informal and subjective. There are standardised and validated observer-rated scales of maternal or caregiver interaction available (e.g. CARE-index, Crittenden  ). Such scales, however, are time-consuming and costly requiring trained raters and so are only used in research settings. fMRI offers the opportunity to develop newer more accurate observer-rated scales of maternal interaction that can be used in clinical settings or to evaluate innovative parenting interventions. \n\nIt is likely that a number of different pathways or mechanisms could result in a mother exhibiting suboptimal maternal care. Studies that focus on the neurobiological correlates of maternal sensitivity in a distinct group of mothers representing natural variations in maternal sensitivity were few, including one of our own (Elmadih et al.  ). Preliminary evidence from these studies showed that maternal sensitivity appears to be accompanied by a discrete neural correlate and that modulation of maternal brain responses by oxytocin (OT) is possible (i.e. as evidenced by the significant correlation between plasma OT and BOLD activation). Yet, further studies are needed before fMRI could be used as a biomarker for maternal sensitivity. Other analysis parameters, such as connectivity, are being explored to see if more subtle changes are present. In the future, such parameters could be used in conjunction with reported and observational measures to help identify mothers at risk of suboptimal responsiveness at an earlier stage and help to evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to enhance sensitive parental caregiving. \n\nPrevious fMRI studies have used either auditory (infant cries) or visual (images/videos of infants) stimuli to compare maternal brain responses to infant versus non-infant control stimuli; or to own versus unknown infant control stimuli. Such studies have used a range of sample sizes from small to large numbers of participants (  N  \u2009=\u20094\u201330). \n\nStudies reveal a diverse pattern of responses to infant stimuli, including activation in dopamine-associated reward processing areas, cortico-limbic modules, emotional processing pathways and the mirror neuron system. Swain ( ) proposed a model for the brain circuitry underlying parental responsiveness involving subcortical and cortical regions (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This model has been updated (Swain et al.  ) with a breakdown of activate areas commonly reported by parental imaging studies in response to infant stimuli.   \nSwain\u2019s model for the brain basis of parental responsiveness. Source: Swain ( ); used with the permission of the author \n  \n\nFollowing salience appraisal involving sensory, autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways which activate the sensory cortex, three potential responses were identified:   \n\u2018Reflexive caring\u2019, located in the subcortical brain, including the hypothalamus, medial preoptic area, lateral septum, amygdala and thalamocingulate regions; \n  \n\u2018Empathic and related cognitive emotional responses associated with mentalization\u2019, including mirror neuron systems in the frontal, insular and superior temporoparietal cortices, cingulate and regions associated with memory such as the hippocampus; \n  \n\u2018Drives and habits related to emotions, alarm and preoccupations\u2019, including the ventral tegmental area, striatum, amygdala, insula, cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex. \n  \n\nThis model is based on a review of neuroimaging studies to date. Our meta-analysis seeks to refine this parental brain model using quantitative techniques. Given the diversity of findings, spatial meta-analysis (Turkeltaub et al.  ) may be the most appropriate way more robustly to establish whether (and which) specific brain areas are most likely to represent a dedicated neural network for maternal responsiveness. Lieberman and Cunningham ( ) recommended greater focus on drawing conclusions from meta-analysis rather than from a single fMRI study. This has the potential to provide more reliable results by reducing type I errors (i.e. false positives) and, where appropriate, allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid type II errors (i.e. missing true effects). \n\nThe primary aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether there is indeed evidence for a dedicated maternal neural network associated with brain responses to visual cues from own versus control infants (up to the age of 2\u00a0years). First, we undertook a systematic review to summarise reported maternal brain activation. Second, we examined quantitatively evidence for distinct activation patterns in maternal responding to own infant, focusing on studies using visual stimuli. Auditory stimuli used in studies of maternal response typically comprise emotionally laden baby laughter or cry sounds. By contrast, studies using visual stimuli include neutral as well as emotional faces, allowing responses to infants per se to be disambiguated from responses specifically to infants expressing emotion. It is important to note that whilst visual and auditory cues are most commonly used within fMRI imaging studies due to the constraints of the technique, in a naturalistic setting, other infant stimuli such as tactile and olfactory are likely to influence maternal brain responsiveness. \n\nWe hypothesised that (1) maternal brain responsiveness to infant versus control stimuli in healthy new mothers is associated with a distributed neural network; (2) this network is consistent with current models of maternal neural responses (Swain et al.  ); (3) differences in activation to own versus control infant will be particularly significant for neural regions associated with hedonic responses (reward from the experience of maternal love) and emotional salience. More specifically, we predict that there will be differences in activation in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and septal regions, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula and basal ganglia (in relation to the hedonic response and emotional salience of infant stimuli). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic review: inclusion criteria for studies \n  \nOnly original fMRI studies were included, in which healthy mothers were exposed to visual stimuli of own as well as control infants (up to 24\u00a0months in age), and a comparison of maternal brain activation in response to these stimuli was undertaken. To reduce bias in spatial meta-analyses, it is important that only data from independent studies is included. Therefore, study data were excluded if it contributed to another study, in which case the study with the largest group size was included. Studies including infants older than 24\u00a0months were eliminated to avoid excess heterogeneity between infant stimuli that may minimise the areas of brain activation identified through meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Identification of studies \n  \nPapers were identified by typing the word combination [\u2018parent\u2019 or \u2018mother\u2019 or \u2018maternal\u2019] and [\u2018fMRI\u2019 or \u2018imaging\u2019] into the search engines \u2018PubMed\u2019, \u2018Web of Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Google Scholar\u2019. The words \u2018fMRI\u2019/\u2019imaging\u2019 and \u2018parent\u2019/\u2018mother\u2019/\u2018maternal\u2019 had to appear in the title or abstract in order for the papers to be identified. Works that incorporated one of these words, such as \u2018mother  ing  ,\u2019 were also valid. Relevant research and review papers were searched for mention of additional studies. Researchers identified as leading the field were contacted to enquire whether they had carried out additional research. The methodology was in line with the principles of systematic reviews as outlined by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (2011). \n\n\n### Method of meta-analysis \n  \nEstimates of association were meta-analysed using the software GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ), which is suitable for studies with comparable experimental paradigms even if the number of studies is small. Studies using photographs or videos of infants were combined in the analysis. Confirmation was obtained from studies\u2019 authors that data did not overlap between studies to ensure data points were not included more than once. All reported findings satisfy criteria of   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.001 for fixed effects (whole brain uncorrected) or   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 FWE corrected/  p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.001 whole brain uncorrected for random effects analysis. The field strength of the scanners used in each included study was also recorded (see supplementary Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ). Potentially, studies using lower field strength scanners may impact the spatial resolution but not localisation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identified studies \n  \nTwelve identified studies were published between November 2002 and January 2016. Results from an additional unpublished study (Abel et al.  ) were obtained directly from the researchers. Strathearn et al. ( ) was reported to be an earlier version of the authors\u2019 later papers (Strathearn et al.  ,  ), and was hence excluded from reported summaries and further analyses leaving. Of the 12 studies remaining, 7 used static images (i.e. photographs) and 5 used moving images (i.e. videos). \n\nSupplementary Table   (S1) provides a chronological summary of all identified studies (both static images and videos), the stimuli used, their research design, and the contrasts they provided \n\n\n### Summary of identified brain activity \n  \nAn overview of areas reported as significantly activated in identified studies of mothers exposed to visual stimuli of own versus control infant stimuli is given in supplementary Tables\u00a0  and   (S2 and S3). The diversity of reported results suggests that a broad range of brain areas are associated with a mother responding to visual stimuli of her own infant. Within the current literature, there is a wide range of findings from studies with relatively small sample sizes. Meta-analysis was therefore performed and related to existing literature. \n\n\n### Studies included in the meta-analysis \n  \nTable   shows a summary of included and excluded studies, how many participants took part in each study, and how many relevant foci were provided by each study. Of the 12 identified studies, 9 (Nitschke et al.  ; Ranote et al.  ; Noriuchi et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ; Atzil et al.  ; Barrett et al.  ; Wan et al.  ; Abel et al.  ) provided foci for maternal brain activation in response to images of own versus control children (familiar or unknown). Two studies (Swain et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ) were excluded as it was not possible to obtain the relevant foci for them\u2014they were not reported in the papers and the authors were unable to provide them upon request.   \nIncluded and excluded studies \n  \n\nOne study (Atzil et al.  ) reported foci for both intrusive and synchronous mothers; however, for the purpose of the analyses, foci for the combined results were used (i.e., including all mothers). In this study, synchronous mothers were those whose behaviour was appropriate and relevant to the infant signals whilst intrusive mothers demonstrated excessive maternal behaviour not in keeping with the infants\u2019 signals. Another study (Strathearn et al.  ) reported foci for activation in response to happy, sad and neutral infant faces, while Barrett et al. ( ) reported foci using happy and sad infant faces; for the purpose of the analysis, the combined results (i.e. responses to all faces) were used. One study applied small volume correction to their initial results (Noriuchi et al.  )\u2014it was not possible to obtain the coordinates for activation prior to small volume correction and so this study was excluded in order to prevent spatial bias. The nine included studies provided 136 foci overall, with 147 subjects included. Eight studies provided coordinates in Talairach space, while one study (Abel et al.  ) reported coordinates in MNI space. These were converted into Talairach space using GingerALE. \n\nProbability maps were generated uncorrected at   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001. This strict   p   value was chosen in lieu of correction for multiple comparisons and in absence of cluster level stats. This approach is recommended in the GingerALE manual. Once the analysis had been run in GingerALE, \u2018Mango\u2019 software (v 3.8; Designed and developed by Jack L. Lancaster, Ph.D. and Michael J. Martinez) was used to produce images of activated brain areas. \n\n\n### Results of meta-analysis \n  \nTable   shows results for meta-analysis of nine studies (total sample\u2009=\u2009147 participants), uncorrected (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) level of significance. Based on the combined results of these studies, maternal exposure to visual stimuli of own versus control children was associated with activation (uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) of the following brain areas: left thalamic ventral lateral nucleus, bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 4), left uncus (BA 34) and amygdala in the limbic lobe and left caudate body (Fig\u00a0 ).   \nSummary of maternal brain activity as identified by meta-analyses in response to visual stimuli of own and control infant (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) (  n  \u2009=\u2009147) \n  \n ACT   activated \n    \nBrain activation in mothers exposed to visual stimuli for own versus control infant. Activation was found within the thalamus, post-central gyri, caudate and parahippocampus.   P  \u2009=\u20090.0001, uncorrected \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time formal meta-analysis methodologies have been used to integrate evidence for a distributed maternal brain circuitry. The main finding was that significant activation occurred in far fewer areas than suggested by conventional systematic literature review. Meta-analysis identified increased activation in response to own versus unknown infant visual stimuli in left thalamic ventral lateral nucleus; bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 4), left uncus (BA 34) and amygdala in the limbic lobe, and left caudate body. \n\nOur findings differ from models previously proposed by Swain ( ), Swain et al. ( ) primarily because we highlight fewer areas robustly activated by visual contrasts of own versus unknown infants. \n\nAlthough the diversity of brain areas robustly activated in response to infant visual stimuli concords with the complexity of maternal behaviour, it is also likely to reflect differences in the stimuli and fMRI paradigm across studies, as well as the variety of neural responses which depend on the particular \u2018affective cognitive\u2019 style of individual mothers. The interface between affective and cognitive processing, termed \u2018affective cognition\u2019, includes the ability to attend to, recognise and interpret different emotional stimuli (e.g. emotive sounds, words, facial expressions, body language), as well as how such information is categorised, encoded and subsequently recalled from memory to guide current behaviour (Elliott et al.  ). Thus, a mothers\u2019 individual affective cognitive style is likely to be another factor influencing the neural responses identified by fMRI. We consider, therefore, evidence from fMRI studies of affect, emotion and cognitive processing that should (in relation to the each of the brain areas) be activated robustly following meta-analysis. \n\n### Thalamus \n  \nWe identified thalamic activation in response to own versus control infants; this is consistent with previous studies in mothers who reported an increase of positive emotional experience when seeing their own infants (Swain et al.  ). The thalamus is high in dopaminergic projections (S\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.  ) and activation within this area has been associated with motivational salience of infant stimuli (Swain et al.  ). \n\nThalamic activation is found in neural responses to own versus other infants in both visual and infant cry paradigms (Swain et al.  ); and it is activated differently by infant compared to adult, or animal faces of any age (Caria et al.  ). In the Swain et al. models ( ) (Swain  ), the thalamus is considered important for reflexive caring. However, thalamic activation may also be part of a thalamic-cortical-basal ganglia loop associated with repetitive or reflex behaviours (Baxter  ; Leckman et al.  ). \n\n\n### Precentral gyrus \n  \nOur analysis revealed bilateral activation in precentral gyrus. Human maternal care is a very tactile and active process which involves the coordination of many motor outputs; lifting, cuddling, cradling, rocking, feeding etc. Activity in this area may, therefore, be associated with planning behavioural outputs, provoked in a mother when she views images of her infant and associated with her intent or desire to respond to her child needs (Swain et al.  ). Alternatively, this activity may be related to the \u2018readiness-to-act\u2019, perhaps associated with hypervigilance that comes with appropriate maternal sensitivity. \n\n\n### Limbic lobe \n  \nLeft limbic lobe activation, comprising activation in uncus (BA 34) and amygdala occurred in mothers looking at own versus other infants. The uncus is the most anterior and medial portion of the parahippocampal gyrus, located directly above the amygdala (Tamraz et al.  ). The attribution of emotional salience to stimuli engages these areas along with insula, amygdala and basal ganglia (Phan et al.  ). \n\nThe parahippocampal lobe plays an important role in encoding emotional memory and retrieval (Ferreira et al.  ). The ability to call on previous experience is an essential aspect of maternal caregiving, especially in new mothers who are learning new skills constantly. Processing and regulation of emotional information, alongside memory retrieval, is likely to be a key aspect in appropriate maternal behaviour. In Swain et al.\u2019s   model, several other areas including the insula, cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex were included under the \u2018drives and habits\u2019 response. Survival of the limbic lobe\u2019s focus of activation through meta-analysis shows that it is consistently activated by maternal imaging paradigms. The absence of foci of activation within other limbic areas such as the insula and cingulate cortices may reflect the diversity of paradigms in studies of maternal responses to infant stimuli. For example, in Swain et al.\u2019s   review, children aged up to 6\u00a0years, fathers and non-visual stimuli have been included. \n\n\n### Caudate \n  \nOur analysis revealed a focus of activation within the left caudate nucleus, one of the structures of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are part of a reward network that includes septal regions and left orbitofrontal cortex (Bechara et al.  ; Peters and B\u00fcchel\u00a0 ). Basal ganglia activation has also been associated with obsessional behaviours (Hars\u00e1nyi et al.  ). It has been suggested that activation of these areas implies that a mother\u2019s feelings towards her new infant are akin to obsessional or addictive behaviour in terms of their reward response (Burkett and Young  ). This notion is supported by mothers\u2019 descriptions of the powerful emotions they experience on exposure to their new infant (e.g., Leckman et al.  ; Swain et al.  ). The dopaminergic reward system in the midbrain is crucial for the motivation of caregiving in new mothers (Numan and Numan  ; Strathearn  ). Activation of basal ganglia in response to own versus control children mirrors findings of similar responses to romantic partners (Bartels and Zeki  ), which the authors associated with the feeling of reward that comes from love and attachment for a salient other and with exposure to representations of that object of attachment. \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nAs far as we are aware, this is the first study to use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess evidence for the neural correlates of maternal responding. Systematic review ensures that all studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria are included and are identified using an explicit search technique. This reduces selection bias when describing positive findings from the research literature. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative method for integrating findings with the advantages that (1) consistent regional effects are identified (and inconsistent ones discarded), (2) statistical power is increased and (3) use of coordinate data avoids the problems of different neuro-anatomical labelling systems which may be present in the primary studies. \n\nOf the nine included studies, three included only first-time mothers (Nitschke et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ). A limited literature has addressed the impact of \u2018first time\u2019 mothering on maternal brain responsiveness (e.g. Strathearn et al.  ), maternal sensitivity (e.g. Elmadih et al.  ) or oxytocin responsiveness (Feldman et al.  ). However, no significant differences were found in these parameters in relation to first-time mothering, possibly because the lack of experience with parenting, seen in first-time mothers reflected as maternal \u2018competency\u2019 rather than maternal \u2018sensitivity\u2019. \n\nThere are some important limitations to consider. None of the included studies compared mothers\u2019 responses to own infants with responses to other key attachment figures including romantic partners or other reward stimuli. It is not possible, therefore, to establish whether activation of the identified brain areas are unique to mothers being exposed to their infants. We do not believe that the quality of included studies caused the relative lack of brain areas showing significant activation following meta-analysis. It may be simply that even the relatively minor variations in paradigms between studies produced too much change in voxel-based foci of activation to generate meaningful results in meta-analysis. The GingerALE software advises that studies with similar paradigms can be used, but the use of a standardised maternal sensitivity paradigm may be of considerable value in generating more reproducible and robust results, as will be discussed below. Interpretation of patterns of activation may also be compromised because stimuli were only representations of children and, although some stimuli were videos which provide more ecological validity, the visual stimuli were presented without auditory (Swain and Lorberbaum  ), olfactory (Porter et al.  ) or tactile cues (Kaitz et al.  ); all of which induce maternal neural responses. Although stimulus modalities are not regularly combined within studies, addition of such cues could add ecological validity to future research designs. \n\nMost (but not all) of the included studies (Nitschke et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ; Barrett et al.  ; Wan et al.  ; Abel et al.  ) clearly specified using only right-handed mothers. This variation could potentially have impacted the interpretation of activation localisation for example in areas such as the precentral gyrus (although we found bilateral activation of this area)\u2014future studies would benefit from clearly specifying handedness. \n\nAs in any meta-analysis, the studies with more participants may have greater effect on the final results, skewing them towards findings in those studies. Similarly, heterogeneity between samples, stimuli and designs may reduce areas of brain activation identified. We minimised this bias by eliminating studies with infants older than 24\u00a0months (the oldest infants in the included studies were 16\u00a0months) which provided an acceptably narrow range given the nature of meta-analysis requiring integration of individual paradigms. All studies used unknown children as control stimuli. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nOur findings suggest that future imaging research in mothers should be collaborative. This would allow standardisation of experimental fMRI paradigms using a greater number and a more demographically diverse subject group (e.g. ethnicity or parity). This is key to increasing statistical power and robustness of the results (Dale  ). \n\nWe also suggest comparisons with matched non-mothers, mothers with varying behavioural maternal sensitivity (Elmadih et al.  ), mothers with mental illness (Abel et al.  ) and fathers of the same infant, as piloted by Swain et al. ( ). Infant temperament and sociality is known to regulate and interact with maternal behaviour, but few studies have examined this in relation to maternal neural responses. Infant eye tracking could be employed alongside fMRI to explore such associations further. Multisite collaboration is also required to recruit mothers from hard-to-access groups (e.g. those with severe mental illness) which may be associated with poor maternal sensitivity so that we may optimise the patient and public benefits of this innovative research stream. Although much can be done to share fMRI stimuli and analysis paradigms, cross-country, intergroup funding applications are key to facilitate such an approach in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nFunctional imaging is increasingly employed to study the neurobiology underpinning human parental response. Regional brain activation may serve as a benchmark of healthy responsiveness. Research is beginning to detail ways in which brain responses to infants may be modulated in new parents. Such approaches are likely to be of increasing interest in the development of novel parenting interventions; for example, those involving the administration of intranasal oxytocin alone or in combination with behavioural approaches. However, its utility can only be exploited to improve clinical outcomes if studies produce consistent results and many studies have been too small and varied to do so. Meta-analysis provides a powerful technique whereby fMRI data can be integrated to identify robust changes. This study highlights the importance of using meta-analysis, as well as common experimental designs, to allow larger sample sizes. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6440933, "text_md5": "925e5d8a4968abedd836436f2f1e745e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 231], "journal": [232, 255], "publication_year": [257, 261], "title": [272, 347], "keywords": [361, 410], "abstract": [423, 2031], "body": [2040, 29391]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29987638, "doi": "10.1007/s00737-018-0878-2", "pmcid": "6440933", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6440933", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6440933"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6440933\">6440933</a>", "list_title": "PMC6440933  Neural pathways of maternal responding: systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique that might potentially fill in this gap. Nevertheless, studies using this approach feature great methodological heterogeneity, such as varying voxel of choice, differences on emphasized metabolites, and absence of a standardized unit. In this study, we present a methodology for creating a systematic review and meta-analysis for this kind of scientific evidence using the prototypical case of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n  Systematic review registration:  \nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), CRD42018112418. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.   It is a prevalent disorder among children and adolescents that often persists into adulthood.   ADHD is also highly associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders   and negative outcomes, such as poor quality of life,   unemployment,   and increased mortality.   The economic burden associated with ADHD in the U.S. alone is estimated to be US$67-116B yearly due to lack of productivity.   Even so, key aspects of the neural basis of the disorder remain to be unmasked.  \n\nSince the 1990s, major advances in technology have made it possible to better understand brain diseases through the study of the brain\n  in vivo  \n.   Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, for instance, have shown the role of frontoparietal and default mode network systems on ADHD.   Nevertheless, some areas of neuroscience, such as neurochemistry, have shown a more modest progress, still majorly relying on either\n  post-mortem  \nor more indirect approaches.   Given this framework, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) appears to be a link to partially fill in this gap and promote an upgraded landscape on the study of the biochemistry of living tissues.  \n\nMRS is a technique based on the concept of chemical shift, which describes how electronic shielding of an atomic nucleus embedded in a more complex chemical compound \u2013 i.e., a nucleus not free \u2013 changes its resonance frequency.   This allows us to establish different fingerprints to different molecules based on specific resonance frequencies of protons and estimate their amount on a certain pre-specified volume of interest. Following this principle, some molecules are classically found on MRS studies of neural tissue, such as n-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, myo-inositol, and lactate.  \n\nThe first MRS studies of the brain of living organisms were performed in the 1980s,   whereas ADHD spectroscopy began in the early 2000s   ; the technique has been progressively more used since then. Nonetheless, the increasing amount of data available regarding this approach has revealed to be somehow problematic for those willing to summarize the knowledge generated, especially on the grounds of methodological heterogeneity within studies focusing on the same disease. There are at least three levels of variation among MRS studies. First of all, the voxels studied greatly vary for each design. Secondly, not all the studies identify the same metabolites. Finally, there is no standard unit for the results. In an MRS chart, one axis indicates frequency, and the other identifies an arbitrary unit influenced by many factors such as voxel size and radiofrequency coil sensitivity.   In addition to that, some authors use pure metabolite quantifications, whilst others prefer ratios of metabolites, usually using creatine as a baseline.  \n\nThe present study aims to delineate a method for grouping the data of MRS studies of patients with ADHD. More specifically, we describe a methodology for creating a systematic review and meta-analysis for this kind of scientific evidence. As a meta-analysis combines statistical findings of different studies addressing the same scientific problem to extract a single result, it seems to qualify as an appropriate method to tackle the difficulties found in the field.   Our main goal in this protocol is to describe a methodology capable of circumventing the aforementioned setbacks of merging spectroscopy results. Hopefully, with this work, we will be able to establish whether there are consistent differences among brain metabolites of patients with ADHD and those of healthy controls, and additionally, in doing so, to evaluate the reliability of the MRS approach as performed thus far. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis protocol has already been registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero) under the title \u201cMagnetic resonance spectroscopy on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis\u201d and ID number CRD42018112418. The outline of our protocol is in accordance with the 17-item checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015).  \n\n### Search on databases \n  \nWe are going to look for studies that measure brain metabolites through MRS in patients with ADHD and healthy controls. Using specific keywords previously selected (\n \n), we are going to perform searches on the following databases: Embase, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science. We also plan on looking for unpublished works on ERIC, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), CINAHL Database, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, using the keywords \u201cADHD\u201d and/or \u201cAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\u201d for the condition, and \u201cMRS,\u201d \u201cMR spectroscopy,\u201d and/or simply \u201cspectroscopy\u201d for the technique. No restriction will be imposed on language or year of publication. All entries will be recorded in a comprehensive list. Duplicates will be removed and the remainder records will form the final list for eligibility evaluation. Once the studies are selected, we are going to look for further potential candidate articles in the reference lists of all the studies included (\n \n). \n\n   Databases and keywords    \n\n\n### Study identification and selection \n  \nTwo authors will independently analyze the whole list of studies to assess eligibility. Their evaluation will be matched for each entry and divergences (through percentage and Kappa statistics: \u03ba \u2261 (po \u2013 pe)/(1-pe) = 1 \u2013 (1-po)/(1-pe), where\n  po  \nis the relative observed agreement among raters (accuracy), and\n  pe  \nis the hypothetical probability of chance agreement. Whenever divergences are found, the articles will be finally assessed by a third author. In a first approach, studies not related to our investigation will be excluded on the basis of title and abstract. All remaining entries will be subjected to full-text reading, when other studies might be ruled out. \n\nThe following inclusion criteria will be considered: 1) all studies must contain at least one group with patients with ADHD and one group with healthy controls; 2) all studies must contain original proton MRS data on brain metabolites. When more than one diagnosis is considered, the studies will be included if there is a group comprised of patients with ADHD only. Cases will be defined as individuals diagnosed with ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM-III) (attention deficit disorder [ADD]), DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5 through either professional direct evaluation or screening tools, for which the diagnostic value relies on the evaluation of the authors of each study. There will be no age, sex, or ethnicity restrictions. Controls will be defined as individuals verified as not having the condition through either professional direct evaluation or screening tools also based on DSM-III (ADD), DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5 criteria. No screening for other psychiatric conditions will be required, neither for cases nor for controls; this information will nonetheless be used as a quality criterion to be evaluated in our bias assessment, as described hereinafter. \n\n\n### Study characteristics to be extracted \n  \nExtraction of data from each study will retrieve the following characteristics: year of publication, sample size of each group, male-to-female ratio in each group, aimed population (children/adolescents or adults), mean age of each group, regions of the brain studied, metabolites measured, and main results. The extraction will be performed by two authors, and divergences will be addressed by a third author. General principles of extraction followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  \n\nData directly related to the meta-analysis \u2013 i.e., mean metabolite measurement, standard deviation (or standard error), and sample size for each group (cases and controls) \u2013 will be recorded on independent worksheets, one for each brain region selected. The preferable sources are tables and written data on the article\u2019s full text. When the information is not detected on these formats, graph estimation using a digital ruler   will be performed. In case the previous methods are not available in the study or supplemental material, an email requesting the information will be dispatched for the correspondence address indicated in the authors\u2019 section of the article. If there is no response in two months, the data will be deemed as missing. Two authors will collect the data independently, and disparities will be corrected by discussion consulting the original source. \n\n\n### Selection of brain regions for meta-analysis \n  \nConsidering the heterogeneity of voxel choice among studies, it is important to delineate our approach on grouping data for the meta-analysis. While we anticipate that some degree of subjectivity will be unavoidable, we expect to proceed in a roughly systematic manner, as follows: on a first level, if enough studies are available, we will group data that target specifically the same regions (e.g., left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex); if not enough studies are available, we will combine more comprehensive data, but still on areas spatially related (e.g., left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex); lastly, if the previous methods are not feasible, we intend to incorporate data from similar structures, disregarding laterality. \n\n\n### Bias assessment \n  \nRisk of bias will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)   in its case-control study format. The NOS is a quality scale composed of nine items grouped within three sections: selection, comparability, and exposure. Selection bias is assessed by four questions regarding definition of cases, representativeness of cases, definition of controls, and selection of controls. Quality of comparability between cases and controls is evaluated by a sole topic divided in two items that estimates how well controlled the healthy control group was. Finally, excellence on exposure measures is assessed by three items focusing on quality of records, methods of ascertainment for cases and controls, and non-response rate. The NOS provides a scale from 0 to 9, one point for each of the items mentioned, the final score being related to the quality of the study in a direct fashion. Two authors will perform the NOS evaluation for each study, and the disparities on matched results will be discussed among the evaluators on the basis of the methodological description of the studies. Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression test. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### \nMeta-analysis\n \n  \nStudies will be grouped according to the aforementioned criteria and a meta-analysis will be performed for each metabolite of each region that meets a minimum of three values coming from at least three different studies. In articles with more than one ADHD group available (e.g., \u201ctreatment na\u00efve ADHD group\u201d and \u201con stimulants ADHD group\u201d) in a way that the data cannot be coupled, all ADHD groups will be matched against the control group, with the sample size of the healthy control group divided by the number of ADHD groups rounded down. As for the example given, if both a \u201ctreatment na\u00efve group\u201d and an \u201con stimulants group\u201d are present, both will be fully used as case groups, but matched against a control group divided by two (the number of case groups that meets the eligibility criteria), considering that the control group would be otherwise counted twice. Additionally, when combining different data from the same study (e.g., disregarding lateralization in a study with data from both sides of the brain, hence using two different sets of data from the same study, one for each side), both cases and controls will be divided by two and rounded down. These steps aim to avoid overestimation of sample sizes and both may be applied to the same work simultaneously if needed. \n\nStandardized mean differences obtained through Hedge\u2019s G method with random effects will be employed to determine pooled effect sizes. Significance will be established by a Z-test. Inverse variance will be used to determine individual study weights. Studies will also be assessed on their heterogeneity using the \u03c7   and I   tests, considering p \u2264 0.01 as statistically significant. Low, moderate, and high heterogeneity values will be assumed from I   values of 25, 50, and 75%, respectively.   In light of the fact that the possible use of effect sizes from the same study would artificially decrease heterogeneity, we will employ a three-level analysis adopting \u201cstudy\u201d as an extra random variable. The R package\n  meta  \nwill be used to assess standardized mean differences and heterogeneity values as well as to generate forest plots.  \n\n\n#### \nSensitivity of analysis\n \n  \nWe will perform sensitivity analyses in order to evaluate methodological disparities that might account for effect size differences. First, we intend to use the jackknife method to assess how dissonant studies might be affecting the outcome, excluding one result at a time from each meta-analysis; second, we will execute the analyses again after excluding studies with high risk of bias or rated as \u201cunclear risk of bias\u201d through a score related to our bias assessment from the NOS, as previously described, excluding studies rated as lower than one standard deviation from the mean (bootstrapping will be used to acquire normal distributions and set the thresholds in case the data is non-parametric); and third, we will divide the groups by age, gender, and field strength of the machinery, when enough data is available. Finally, we foresee an additional analysis including only published works to be performed as well. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe MRS seems to be a useful technique for in vivo brain investigations, especially when considering the limited availability of methods for studying neurochemistry in living neural tissue. The main limitation of this approach is that its use is only possible when high concentrations of metabolites are available (in the millimolar range), once the magnetic resonance method is poorly sensitive. Also, on a practical level, there is a significant spectral overlap among many compounds, making its discrimination a particular challenge.   Even so, it is quite puzzling that MRS is not more often used as a way of investigation. Some reasons for that might be speculated. First, the meaning of MRS results might still not be intuitively grasped on a physiological level \u2013 not in a degree that most scientists feel comfortable to rely on. In this sense, it is worth mentioning that more established methods, such as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, although probably to a different degree, can also fall in similar pitfalls.   Apart from that, MRS endures serious heterogeneity among studies, such as varying voxel of choice, occasional disparities on emphasized metabolites, and the absence of a standardized unit of measurement, all of which undermine its long-term technical appraisal. \n\nIn addition to undermining our interpretation of the data, the diversity observed in the use of this technology thus far is a particular obstacle for developing a protocol that aims to combine multiple results in one coherent statistical value. In previous meta-analyses of MRS data, different approaches were employed to address these problems. Concerning pooling brain regions, for instance, we observed that, while some studies do not detail their methods on this point, options included disregarding the brain area of source   \u2013 reasonable for specific neurological issues when functionality is not a primary concern for study purposes \u2013; pre-specifying brain regions to be studied as inclusion criteria   ; choosing a preferable brain side of source when information from both hemispheres is available   ; and stratifying the data in brain lobes.   Meta-analyses also diverge on how to address metabolite measures. While most works screen for all the main proton MRS molecules,   some choose to focus on specific frequency ranges.   We chose to preliminarily include all studies that met our eligibility criteria and subsequently delineate a hierarchical order of preference for merging the outcomes. With this approach, we hope to compile the data in a way that is both comprehensive and as specific as possible. \n\nAnother challenge in evaluating MRS studies concerns an early methodological issue. As it is commonly true for many neuroimaging works, the sample size available is typically small, which brings an extra dilemma into question, as false positive and false negative results are more likely to align, creating a troublesome picture of the variables being studied. Given this framework, a comprehensive portrayal of state-of-the-art MRS knowledge for any given disease often proves to be problematic. In this protocol overview, we presented a model of summarization for MRS data from the prototypical case of ADHD. By following this protocol, we expect to be able to successfully group the data available on MRS metabolites and ADHD in order to achieve unified results for different brain regions in the form of multiple meta-analyses, despite the great diversity of methodological approaches among studies. Additionally, we hope to assess the quality of the MRS case-control studies produced and, as multiple studies align, to indirectly evaluate the reliability of the technique as designed thus far. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nWhereas this approach represents our best efforts on unifying MRS data from different studies, an important drawback of this design must be mentioned. When merging mean results obtained for metabolites, we are, so to say, considering that all works involved are targeting specifically the same areas, while we know that this is arguably never the case, even when the same equipment and personnel are involved. On a larger scale, we are likely to have to occasionally merge data from different voxels on the basis of neuroanatomy and neurofunctional proximity, as described on our methods. Regarding this limitation, we believe it is important to acknowledge that MRS is an estimation of brain metabolite concentrations within a given volume of interest rather than a fine magnifier of brain neurochemistry, its contribution being more on a macroscopic scale. Even so, when present, this problem should be addressed and examined considering its own significance. Illustrations of the brain indicating the disparities and overlap among studies, as in a sort of neural Venn diagram, will hopefully help to discuss the reliability of each result. \n\nAnother limitation of our protocol refers to our broad inclusion criteria, which will include different diagnostic methods and mostly rely on the judgment of the authors of each study, probably blending different diagnostic rationales and different presentations of the same disorder. Nevertheless, at present, this seems to be the only way to pool a reasonable amount of data for our purposes. Also, our primary goal is to investigate MRS metabolites in the general diagnostic standard currently available. As we are still working on a symptom-based approach for diagnosis in psychiatry, biological parameters still have to derive from non-biological clustering, and only subsequent analyses will be able to provide data for different methods in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we believe that our protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis might prove helpful in broadening the use of MRS data. MRS is a potentially fruitful approach for neuroscientific endeavor, and the body of knowledge already generated from it can be used to draw a unified understanding of metabolite concentrations for specific disorders. The heterogeneity in brain areas studied and the need for broad inclusion criteria due to the relatively low number of studies available would probably be the main limitations of our approach. Even so, we hope that our methodology will support us to gather multiple estimates of how much of a substance is present in living neural tissue, opening a vast window of investigation for which the full employment remains to be explored. Therefore, following this protocol will potentially allow us to use the MRS data produced so far to enlighten our current understanding of either ADHD or any other brain disorder.

There is an ongoing debate regarding the belief that people from Eastern cultures possess greater self-control abilities when compared to people from Western cultures. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm to compare 30 studies (719 subjects, 373 foci) that used fMRI to investigate the performance in Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks of participants from Western and/or Eastern countries. Our meta-analysis found differences between the networks activated in Eastern and Western culture participants. The right prefrontal cortex showed distinct patterns, with the Inferior Frontal gyrus more active in the Eastern group and the middle and superior frontal gyri more active in the Western group. Our findings suggest that Eastern culture subjects have a higher tendency to activate brain regions involved in proactive inhibitory control, while Western culture subjects rely more on reactive inhibitory brain regions during cognitive control tasks. This implies that proactive inhibition may play a crucial role in promoting the collective and interdependent behavior typical of Eastern cultures, while reactive inhibition may be more important for efficient cognitive control in subjects of Western cultures that prioritize individualism and independence. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nCulture is a significant factor in shaping our attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, impacting everything from our communication styles to our decision-making processes and perceptions of the world. While it is evident that individuals from different cultures exhibit inhomogeneous and sometimes peculiar behaviors and cognitive processes, the underlying neural mechanisms behind these differences remain largely unknown. Although studies have explored cultural differences in various psychological processes, it is still unclear whether these differences are governed by the same or different neural networks. However, research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified multiple neural circuits that are involved in different psychological processes [ , ]. \n\nIt is commonly believed that individuals from Eastern cultures have a greater capacity for inhibitory control than those from Western cultures, and this idea is a subject of ongoing debate. Research in cultural psychology indicates that there are differences in inhibitory control between individualistic, as are typically considered Western cultures, and collectivistic, as are typically considered Eastern cultures [ , , , , ]. This is likely to be associated with the Eastern philosophy, which conveys the message of the importance of self-control and inner discipline that underlies a collectivist type of culture, where the group and society are very important. \n\nThe basic idea is that what is good for society is also good for the individual, and a balance between individual and society is achieved by modulating self-control through inhibitory abilities [ , , ]. From an early age, Eastern education systems adopt strict parenting and parenting practices that are believed to stimulate and strengthen inhibitory control [ , , ]. Indeed, in studies conducted during early childhood, children aged three to four years old from East Asian nations often demonstrate greater proficiency in measures of inhibitory control, including the Stroop task, when compared to their American counterparts [ , ]. Although it is likely that the difference between people of Western and Eastern cultures may be related to the extent and type of brain regions activated for self-control, when one compares fMRI studies in subjects belonging to the two types of culture, there is a lack of consistency in the neural areas responsible for the respective inhibitory control [ , , , , ]. \n\nThis inconsistency can be attributed to various factors and differences, including the chosen paradigms. In fact, while inhibitory control has been mainly assessed using the Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks interchangeably, these two tasks seem to tackle differently inhibitory components [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. \n\nThere are other relevant factors worth taking into consideration, such as the participants\u2019 ages [ ] or education levels [ ]. Notably, to control for education, it may be useful to also control for cultural proficiency. Inadequate cultural knowledge and/or adaptation have been linked to decreased performance in tasks that require inhibitory control, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [ ] and the Stroop test [ , ]. Conducting a meta-analysis on the data obtained from previous studies could better clarify the implications of the various circuits in the modulation of cognitive control as a function of the two cultures. As far as we know, no meta-analysis has been carried out to investigate the potential variations in neural correlates associated with inhibitory control in Western and Eastern cultures. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Western and Eastern cultures on the neurobiological underpinnings of inhibitory control while controlling for variables that may affect inhibition, such as task design [ ], aging [ ], and education [ ]. \n\nTo this end, we conducted a meta-analysis and compared 30 studies that used fMRI to investigate the Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks in Western and/or Eastern participants using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm. Since our primary goal was to explore the brain mechanisms underlying inhibitory control in these cultural contexts, rather than focusing on the differences in behavioral outcomes, we took steps to minimize confounding effects by exclusively analyzing volumes derived from trials where inhibition was successfully achieved and by carefully matching the two groups based on the task design. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria \n  \nWe conducted a systematic and comprehensive literature search to select relevant fMRI studies published up to April 2022 using the databases   PubMed   ( \u2014accessed on 8 April 2022) and   Web of Science   ( \u2014accessed on 8 April 2022). The selected keywords were combined using the Boolean operators AND and OR. The   PubMed   search input was: (\u201cStop-Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cStop Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cGo-NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGoNoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo/NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo No-Go\u201d) AND fMRI. The   Web of Science   search input was: TS = ((\u201cStop-Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cStop Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cGo-NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGoNoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo/NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo No-Go\u201d) AND fMRI). Additional studies were searched from the references of all identified publications. Eligibility was determined via a two-step procedure performed by four of the authors (GG, CN, VB, and MC). First, the titles and abstracts of all identified articles were screened. In the second step, the full texts of studies, according to predefined eligibility criteria, were independently examined, and agreement was reached after discussion. Our study was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ ]. \n\nThe studies were considered eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) whole-brain analysis performed on fMRI data (we excluded studies conducted using positron emission tomography and fMRI in which only results from ROI analysis were reported); (2) availability of coordinates of activation foci clearly provided either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space; (3) studies conducted on healthy adults. Exclusion criteria: studies conducted on children or the elderly; studies using stimuli with emotional content, reward, or other inhibitory tasks; studies with pharmacological treatment or training; non-standard neuroimaging data analysis or procedures. The selection of these strict criteria allowed us to select homogeneous studies in order to obtain more robust measures [ ]. From the pool of potentially eligible studies, we performed further selection in order to identify studies for the comparison (quantitative analysis) between studies on Western vs. Eastern culture matched for the type of experimental paradigm (SST and GoNogo) and participant characteristics (age and education level). See   for details on culture studies included in the Eastern or Western groups of studies. \n\n\n### 2.2. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) \n  \nData were analyzed using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis algorithm implemented in GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ). ALE is a coordinate-based meta-analysis method that uses peak coordinates from functional studies as inputs, and has been described well in previous methodological papers [ , , , ]. The ALE algorithm assesses the convergence of activation foci from different neuroimaging studies, modeled as probability distributions, against null distributions of random spatial associations, while controlling for sample size. To minimize within-experiment effects, the non-additive algorithm described in Turkeltaub et al. [ ] was applied. Inference was made at the cluster level, as this provides the best balance between sensitivity and specificity [ ]. The cluster-forming threshold was set to   p   < 0.005, and the size of the resulting supra-threshold clusters was compared to a null distribution determined by 2000 permutations of the data (with a threshold of   p   < 0.05). The selected studies are outlined in  . \n\nThe first two meta-analyses were performed with the activation foci generated by the Go\u2013Nogo and the SST, and were divided into two (Eastern culture and Western culture) groups of studies. To further examine the shared and differential neural substrates during the inhibition task, the two groups of studies (Eastern culture vs. Western culture) were analyzed. A conjunction analysis was performed to assess the potential overlap among the brain networks from the Western and Eastern culture groups, and a pairwise subtraction analysis was used to identify the differences in activation between these two networks [ ]. The analysis was conducted with a statistical threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.01 and 10,000 permutations, and a cluster-size threshold of 200 mm . \n\nThe neuroanatomical coordinates reported in Talairach space [ ] were transformed to MNI space for all analyses. Whole-brain maps of the thresholded ALE images were visualized in Mango V.4.0.1 ( ), an anatomical image overlay program, superimposed onto a standardized anatomical template. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Results of the Study Search \n  \nA PRISMA flow chart of the article selection process is illustrated in  . Our search yielded 597 potentially eligible studies. After evaluation of the full text of these articles, 73 studies were potentially eligible. This pool of studies included 14 Eastern and 59 Western studies. In fact, we considered 15 studies from Eastern cultures, because one study ( ) presented data with both SST and GoNogo tasks. In order to perform a balanced comparison, a subset of 15 Western studies matching the Eastern group for type of experimental design (SST and GoNogo) and participant characteristics (age and education level) was extracted. Therefore, 30 studies (15 from Eastern culture countries and 15 from Western culture countries) from 2003 to 2022 were included in our quantitative analyses. From these studies, a cumulative number of 719 healthy subjects and 373 foci were obtained. The main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are reported in the  . \n\n\n### 3.2. ALE Results \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis of the group of studies from Eastern countries ( ;  ) identified the largest cluster size (7408 mm ) in the right cerebral hemisphere extending from the striatum, the claustrum, the caudate, the insula, and the inferior frontal gyrus and comprising small portions of the right precentral gyrus, putamen, and globus pallidus. The second cluster (2232 mm ) included the right striatum and the claustrum, followed by a cluster (1752 mm ) located in the right middle frontal gyrus, a cluster (1640 mm ) in the bilateral cingulate gyrus and extending to its anterior part, and, finally, a cluster (1376 mm ) in the right middle frontal gyrus. \n\nRegarding the Western group of studies ( ,  ), the ALE algorithm converged in a first cluster (4358 mm ) in the right cerebral hemisphere, including the striatum, the claustrum, and the right insula and extending to a small part of the right inferior frontal gyrus, followed by an almost symmetric cluster (2152 mm ) in the left hemisphere, including the insula and claustrum. The third cluster (2120 mm ) was located in the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, whereas the fourth cluster (1768 mm ) was centered in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA). Finally, we observed a last cluster (1496 mm ) in the left pre-central gyrus. \n\nAs expected, the conjunction analysis between the Western and Eastern groups revealed almost all the above-listed areas ( ,  ). \n\nThe contrast analysis ( ,  ) between Western and Eastern groups of studies showed, in the former, one cluster (1152 mm ) centered in the left pre-central gyrus, followed by a cluster (624 mm ) located in the right middle frontal gyrus, with one cluster (352 mm ) included in the right insula. Finally, we observed one last cluster (256 mm ) in the right superior frontal gyrus. \n\nThe opposite contrast (Eastern versus Western) showed a first cluster (632 mm ) in the right middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus and the pre-central gyrus, followed by a cluster (312 mm ) in the right inferior frontal gyrus and a cluster (296 mm ) in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Finally, we observed one last cluster (280 mm ) in the striatum. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to explore how belonging to either Western or Eastern cultures may result in the distinct functional recruitment of brain areas involved in cognitive control. To accomplish this, we gathered data from studies investigating cognitive control in Western and Eastern population samples, utilizing fMRI to measure performance in the Stop Signal Task (SST) and Go/Nogo tasks. \n\nOur meta-analyses revealed that most of the clusters identified via ALE in both Western and Eastern culture groups were located in the same brain regions. This was evident not only in the separate analyses of each group of studies, but also in the conjunction analysis, which allowed us to identify common areas of activation across both populations. The regions observed in the present meta-analysis align with those identified in previous meta-analyses of fMRI studies on the Go\u2013Nogo and SST tasks [ , , ]. Specifically, the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), right prefrontal cortices (r-IFG, r-MFG, r-SFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, claustrum, and thalamus were consistently observed across these studies. \n\nNotably, upon conducting a contrast analysis on the two groups of studies (Eastern vs. Western culture countries), we observed differences between the underlying networks revealed by the ALE. A discernible pattern of significant clusters was distributed over the right prefrontal cortex. In particular, the contrast between Eastern and Western study groups revealed activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, while the opposite contrast (Western vs. Eastern study groups) showed distinct clusters in the right middle and superior frontal gyri. These results indicate pronounced recruitment of the middle and superior regions of the right prefrontal cortex in the Western group, whereas the lower regions (i.e., inferior prefrontal cortex) are more prominently activated in the Eastern group. This finding is particularly noteworthy as the prefrontal cortex is widely recognized as a region responsible for the inhibitory control of cognitive processes [ , , , ], and there appears to be a dissociation between the right inferior frontal gyrus and the middle/superior frontal gyri depending on the inhibitory phase. To be more precise, the right inferior frontal gyrus (r-IFG) plays a significant role in the attentional aspects of cognitive control and is involved in all stages of inhibition. However, its primary function, according to recent studies, lies in the proactive phase of inhibition [ , , ]. That is, a top-down form of inhibitory control that governs the processes preceding event occurrence, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of motor responses [ , ]. In contrast, the right superior and middle frontal gyri (r-S/MFG) are pivotal brain regions for reactive inhibition, which is a bottom-up form of inhibitory control. Reactive inhibition is believed to act as a \u201ccut-trigger,\u201d halting an already initiated motor response [ , , , ]. \n\nThe results herein highlight the greater propensity of Eastern populations to activate brain regions that mediate proactive inhibitory control, while those from Western cultures may rely more on reactive inhibitory brain regions to achieve accurate inhibition during cognitive control tasks. This is an intriguing result as it may suggest that proactive inhibition, as reflected in brain activations, may play a crucial role in fostering the collective and interdependent behavior that is commonly observed in people of Eastern cultures. On the other hand, reactive inhibition, as a cognitive control mechanism, may be predominant in achieving efficient cognitive control for cultures that prioritize individualism and independence, which are commonly observed in Western cultures [ , , , , ]. \n\nHowever, from an alternative perspective, we can speculate that the difference in prioritizing reactive control might arise from the Western inclination for swift action, influenced by their fast-paced lifestyles, while the Eastern mindset might tend to favor contemplation and a more meditative approach to life. \n\nAnother difference observed in the contrast between the Eastern and Western groups of studies is the anterior cingulate cortex. This result corroborates our interpretation; in fact, the anterior cingulate cortex is not just a brain region responsible for detecting and resolving conflict [ , , ], but it is also at the basis of the proactive mechanism, as recently pointed out in different studies [ , ]. Indeed, being able to better manage and resolve conflicts is undoubtedly a necessary skill for adapting to more collective cultures such as those in the Eastern countries. Hence, it is not surprising that this brain region has been consistently identified as neuro-anatomically and functionally [ ] different in individuals from Eastern cultures when compared to their Western counterparts. \n\nFinally, we observed greater activation of the striatum in the group of Eastern culture countries and higher activation of the left precentral cortex in the group of Western culture countries. The former finding aligns with the possibility that individuals from Eastern cultures may possess stronger inhibitory control, although this assertion lacks conclusive evidence. Conversely, the latter finding suggests that individuals from Western cultures may exhibit a more impulsive response during the Go\u2013Nogo and SST tasks. Indeed, Gavazzi et al. [ ] reported a positive correlation between impulsivity during the proactive phase of a Go\u2013Nogo task and increased BOLD signals in the left precentral gyrus. This is a result that is consistent with many studies reporting that the left hemisphere is crucial in the link between impulsivity and inhibitory control at the functional and morphometric neuroimaging levels [ ]. Additionally, there is evidence showing that the left hemisphere may be dominant, or is at least involved, in some aspects of inhibitory control [ , ]. Despite the existence of several pieces of evidence linking inhibition and impulsivity, an ongoing debate remains regarding the possibility [ ] that impulsivity may not be directly related to inhibitory control. Therefore, future studies are needed to assess our interpretation of the precentral gyrus. \n\nTaking into account the examination of these findings in the broader ongoing discussion about the complex interplay between culture and the brain, and their reciprocal influence [ ], it is plausible to speculate that environmental factors significantly contribute to the impact of culture on inhibitory neuroprocesses. Notably, the cultural differentiation of the brain appears to be influenced more by the cultural aspects of the environment in which individuals reside, rather than solely by their race or original culture [ ]. However, it is important to note that the involvement of genetic or gene\u2013environment effects cannot be completely discounted. In fact, genetic expression appears to be implicated in cultural aspects, such as the acquisition of cultural norms [ ]. \n\nOverall, the present findings suggest differential activation of the inhibitory network in Eastern-collectivist and Western-individualist cultures. Our meta-analysis corroborates the findings of the few studies conducted to compare inhibitory processes using a cross-cultural design [ , , ]. Namely, differential activations of brain regions embedded in the inhibitory network (i.e., the dACC in relation to prediction error [ ] and the IFG [ , ]) have been reported. Therefore, previous neuroimaging data may support our hypothesis of higher engagement of the proactivity-related brain regions [ ] during inhibitory tasks in collectivist cultures compared to individualist cultures. Interestingly, Telzer et al. [ ] found a greater decline in inhibitory behavioral performance over time in Western participants than in Eastern participants, an effect paralleled by increasing activation of the IFG among the collectivist group, while this neural activation stayed low in the individualist group. Most evidence of cultural differentiation in inhibitory behavioral performance comes from childhood studies, with children from collectivist cultures outperforming those from individualist ones in inhibition efficiency [ , , , , , , ]. Regarding adults, if neural results always point out a cultural differentiation, this is not always the case for behavioral data. Namely, enhanced inhibitory performance for collectivism vs. individualism have been found in some studies [ , ], but not in others [ , , ]. Different task designs or group compositions might represent confounding variables to be taken into careful consideration while interpreting contrasting evidence from these behavioral findings. A dissociation between neuroimaging and behavioral data does not come as a surprise, as behavioral measures, especially when embedded in neuroimaging designs, might lack sensibility. In fact, cultural differentiation in neurocognitive functions might occur even in the absence of purely behavioral evidence thanks to the extra fine-grained level of analysis [ , , ]. \n\nSome limitations should be acknowledged. First, to reach adequate statistical power, we were forced to use broad inclusion criteria for studies examining subjects from Western and Eastern culture countries. In addition, our current methodology did not enable us to eliminate certain potential confounding variables that require further examination in future studies. Specifically, two key factors that necessitate exploration in subsequent research are the lack of measures allowing for the exploration of brain\u2013behavior relationships, and the requirement for a quantitative assessment of the cultural aspects pertaining to the participants included in the studies. Additionally, due to missing data, we were unable to retrieve education information from all of the studies. Finally, it is important to recognize that our meta-analysis did not reveal some commonly observed subcortical brain areas, such as the subthalamic nucleus [ , ]. This limitation has been commonly observed in fMRI studies, as demonstrated by Isherwood et al. [ ]. \n\nFuture studies should aim to utilize larger and more diverse samples, control for more confounding variables, and incorporate culturally sensitive experimental designs to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these cultural differences in inhibitory control and the impact of cultural context on the development and manifestation of these processes. Moreover, understanding how these cultural differences in inhibitory control influence behavior and cognition can have practical implications, such as in educational and clinical settings. For instance, in the case of clinical settings, this knowledge may help to develop customized interventions that align with the cultural context of patients, thereby increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes, enhancing therapeutic alliances, and improving treatment adherence [ , ]. Furthermore, it can aid in identifying at-risk individuals and implementing early interventions to prevent mental health problems. \n\nBy better understanding the neural mechanisms associated with cultural differences, we can gain insights into how culture influences cognition and behavior, and ultimately develop more effective interventions to address cultural disparities in health and well-being. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 10295933, "text_md5": "cf35a10a1b157d520758ce207f290a13", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 165], "journal": [166, 175], "publication_year": [177, 181], "title": [192, 256], "keywords": [270, 388], "abstract": [401, 1838], "body": [1847, 25674]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37371385, "doi": "10.3390/brainsci13060907", "pmcid": "10295933", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10295933", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10295933"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10295933\">10295933</a>", "list_title": "PMC10295933  Cultural Differences in Inhibitory Control: An ALE Meta-Analysis"}

Neither increased nor decreased regions were detected in FC and GMV of migraine patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe left thalamus and brainstem were the significantly activated regions of migraine. It is a meaningful insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. The consistent alterated brain areas of morphometrical and functional in migraine patients were far from reached based on current studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a complex neurological dysfunction characterized by recurrent attacks and pulsating headaches susceptible to physical or environmental factors. Broad clinical symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia etc., have been complained by suffers, with a headache duration ranging from 4 to 72 h ( ). The estimated 1-year prevalence of migraine is about 15%, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1 ( ). \n\nHowever, the underlying neuroimaging alterations in migraine patients have previously been studied using functional and structural MRI techniques, with inconsistent conclusions ( \u2013 ). Some studies reported the increased functional connectivity (FC) in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( ), superior frontal gyrus, and temporal pole ( ), while decreased FC in periaqueductal gray (PAG) ( ), hypothalamus ( ), ACC ( ), temporal lobe ( ), insular cortex ( ) and amygdala ( ). Among migraine patients, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was significantly increased in bilateral thalami, middle frontal gyrus and left insula ( ), and decreased in putamen ( ), cerebellum ( ), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ( ). Meanwhile, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies suggested that brain gray matter volume (GMV) increased in PAG, bilateral fusiform gyri, and cingulate gyri ( ), and decreased in cerebellar culmen ( ), ACC, hippocampus ( ), and orbitofrontal cortex ( ). \n\nIf there are regions that both function and structure altered in migraine patients. Based on ReHo, amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and positron emission tomography (PET), meta-analysis demonstrated decreased activity in the angular gyrus, visual cortex, and cerebellum, while increased in the caudate, thalamus, pons, and prefrontal cortex ( ). On the other hand, GMV decrease in posterior insular-opercular regions, the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex were revealed with AES-SDM ( ,  ). It is frustrating that a consistent conclusion was not drawn. Meanwhile, there still a lacks meta-analysis on the brain FC alterations in migraine patients. As more studies on the brain structure and function alterations in migraine patients have been published, it is urgent to perform a meta-analysis to draw a comprehensive conclusion including functional and structural studies. \n\nTherefore, we conduct the current neuroimaging meta-analysis on brain structure and function changes in migraine patients, with the hope of drawing a solid conclusion. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThis study was registered on the PROSPERO ( ), with the registration number CRD42021257300. \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was conducted in the database of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE from inception to Sept 2022, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) ( ). The subject terms and keywords, (\u201cmigraine\u201d OR \u201cprimary headache\u201d) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d) AND (\u201cstructure\u201d OR \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d OR \u201cmorphometrical\u201d OR \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d OR \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d OR \u201cfunction\u201d), were used to identify candidate VBM and rs-fMRI studies. Then, manual screening was conducted in the references of the retrieved studies and reviews. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies that meet the following criteria were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis: (1) migraine patients diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) ( ); (2) MRI studies employed morphometric approaches of VBM, or functional metrics of FC and ReHo; (3) seed-based FC to whole-brain compared patients with migraine with health controls (HC) group; (4) coordinates were reported in Montreal Neurological Institute space (MNI), or Talairach space, and (5) peer-reviewed. Multiple papers published by the same author were included following the criteria: including the largest number of participants, latest published ones, and reported coordinates underwent stringent correction. \n\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1) no HC group, (2) study was neither VBM nor FC and ReHo, (3) studies on the region of interest (ROI)-ROI, seed-ROI or independent component analysis (ICA), (4) intervention studies (pre/post-treatment contrasts such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or acupuncture), (5) seed-points or peak effect coordinates could not be retrieved, or (6) other types of migraine (e.g., vestibular migraine) and studies for comorbidities ( ). We also excluded those studies that adopted lax statistical methods, like small volume correction (SVC) and uncorrected multiple comparisons. \n  \nThe flowchart of literature screening. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nArticles retrieval, assessment, and data extraction were independently implemented by two authors (CZH and SJT) according to the data extraction protocol. Any vagueness or disagreements were discussed with a third author (CYL), and a consensus was reached. The data information was sequentially collected, such as author, published year, sample size, characteristics of participants (e.g., age, gender, disease duration, and attacks), classification of migraine, and technical details (MRI scanner, seed regions, and correction methods, etc.). The peak coordinates of included studies were edited as available files according to the guidelines of AES-SDM 5.15 ( ) ( ) or ALE 3.02 ( ) ( ). Talairach coordinates were translated into MNI   via   a toolbox provided by Ginger ALE. \n\n\n### Literature quality assessment \n  \nThere is no consensus on the quality evaluation of neuroimaging studies up to now. We performed a customized checklist to assess the quality of included studies based on the assessment items of the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale ( ). The detailed items and scores of included studies are listed in  ,  . \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis \n  \nALE evaluated the significant convergence between peak effect foci from different trials (e.g., migraine > controls, migraine < controls) for a given study in comparison with a random distribution of foci. It treated reported significant foci as spatial probability distributions centered on given coordinates rather than as single points. ALE assesses the cumulative probabilities of each voxel based on reported foci. ALE map was acquired after calculating the union probabilities of each voxel. The true convergence of foci and random clustering was tested by permutation tests. Based on the sample size and random effect model, the likelihood of consensus among different experiments is attained. Each focus is modeled as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution. Then, the modeled activation (MA) map for each study is generated. We employed the recommendation setting of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) (  p   < 0.05) to carry out multiple comparisons, using an initial cluster threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.001, and permutation tests were 5,000 ( ). \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nTo assess the reliability and replicability of main resutls, we conducted a jackknife sensitivity analysis. The method was to repeat the process of removing one study and performing the others with the same meta-analysis at same threshold. If the main results remains significant in all or most of the combinations of the analysis, then it was regarded as rigorous. \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of findings and to eliminate latent factors affecting main results. We conducted subgroup analysis of patients with migraine without aura to exclud clinical and methodological heterogeniety. \n\n\n\n## Result \n  \nThirty-nine MRI studies were included in this analysis, covering 11 VBM ( ), 16 FC ( ), and 9 ReHo studies ( ). It was comprised of 1,355 migraine patients (314 males and 1,041 females) and 1,149 (305 males and 844 females) HCs. Among them, VBM studies recruited 430 migraine patients (120 males, 328 females), and 317 HCs (93 males, 224 females); ReHo studies enrolled 337 migraine patients (77 males, 260 females), and 288 HCs (69 males, 219 females); FC studies included 588 migraine patients (135 males, 453 females), and 544 HCs (143 males, 401 females). All included structural and functional studies were performed statistical analyses for age and sex of included patients and controls (  t  -test or ANOVA,   p   < 0.05), individually. There were no significant differences in age and ratio of gender between migraine and HC, when the data were independently assessed. The preprocessing of fMRI images in all studies was performed by several steps, such as slice timing, realigning, normalizing, regressing nuisance covariates, filtering, and smoothing. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of migraine in the VBM studies. \n  \nACC, anterior cingulate cortex; MWA, migraine with aura; MWoA, migraine without aura; EM, episodic migraine; CM, chronic migraine; FWHM, full width at half maximum; GRF, Gaussian random field theory; FEW, family wise error; FDR, false detect rate; SVC, small volume correction; mM, menstrual migraine; LF, low frequency; HF, high frequency; PAG, periaqueductal gray; LC, locus ceruleus; MRN, median raphe nuclei; dlPFC, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; PHG, parahippocampal gyrus; ICHD-3 beta, international classification of headache disorders, 3rd edition (beta version); PCG, postcentral gyrus; HIS, international headache society; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; T, Tesla; VBM, voxel-based morphometry. \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of FC studies in migraine. \n  \nACC: anterior cingulate cortex; AI: anterior insula; aMCC: anterior midcingulate; ADN: anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus; FC: functional connectivity; GMM: Gaussian Mixture Modeling; GMM: Gaussian Mixture Modeling GRF: Gaussian random field; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; IHS: International Headache Society; ITG: inferior temporal gyrus; LG: lingual gyrus; LGN: lateral geniculate nucleus; MCC: middle cingulum cortex; MFG: middle frontal gyrus; MOG: middle occipital gyrus; mPFC: medial prefrontal cortex; MPC: midline posterior cingulate; MRN: median raphe nuclei; MrD: marginal division of neostriatum; NA: not available; NCF: nucleus cuneiformis; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; PAG: periaqueductal gray; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; PCL: paracentral lobule; PHG: parahippocampal gyrus; RN: red nucleus; SFG: superior frontal gyrus; SMA: supplementary motor area; SN: substantia nigra; STG: superior temporal gyrus; THA: thalamus; VPN: ventral posterior nucleus. \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of migraine in the ReHo studies. \n  \nST, short-term; LT, long-term.

No clusters were above the threshold. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study adopting functional and structural fMRI metrics to verify brain alterations (VBM, FC, and ReHo) in migraine patients. The solid conclusion is that the ReHo values of left thalamus and brainstem were consistently increased. While GMV and FC were not illustrated alterations in migraine in terms of current evidence. \n\nMigraine is associated with various central nervous system disorders ( ). Profoundly prolonged duration and recurrently attacked headache are the main complaints of migraine suffers ( ). Thalamus is thought to have an essential role in the pathophysiology of migraine and has been investigated extensively ( \u2013 ). Meanwhile, the migraine genesis is more likely within brainstem, involving dysfunction and plasticity changes ( ). \n\nIn migraine patients, pain information is transmitted from the meninges to the brain   via   the trigeminovascular pathway starting from trigeminal ganglion neurons ( ). Specifically, the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) neurons convey nociceptive signals to the brainstem (such as periaqueductal gray, reticular formation), hypothalamic, and basal ganglia. Then, the relay thalamic neurons project to the somatosensory, insular, motor, parietal association, auditory, visual, and olfactory cortices to construct the specific properties of migraine pain ( ), for instance, nausea, vomiting, lacrimation, anxiety, and hypothalamic-regulated functions like appetite loosing and fatigue ( ). \n\nReHo is specialized in explore local connectivity in a specific region by characterizing its relationship with nearby voxels in a specific region ( ). Meta-regression analysis has indicated that migraine patients' visual analog scale score was associated with increased brain activity in the left thalamus ( ). Using different meta-analysis method and sensitivity analysis, we also concluded that the left thalamus and brainstem of migraine patients were more spontaneous activated than HCs. Based on these evidences, we speculate that left thalamus and brainstem maybe the biological markers of nociceptive information transmission in frequent migraine attacks. \n\nWe postulated that if there is a certain region affected by long-term migraine, the functional connectivity changes of cerebral regions could be convergent at ones regardless of the chosen of the seed-points. Totally, 16 FC studies were included in this study. Among them, the seed-points were distributed the middle frontal gyrus ( ), precuneus ( ), PAG ( ,  ,  ), insulas ( ,  ,  ), thalamus ( ,  ,  ), pons ( ,  ), lateral geniculate nucleus ( ), amygdala ( ), and lingual gyrus ( ). Although, the regions exhibited FC alteration among those studies, involving cortex about pain processing, visual, auditory, affective, and cognitive evaluation, there is no solid conclusion of pain information projecting of migraine temporarily according to our analysis. \n\nMeanwhiles, the GMV changes of migraine assessed by VBM were heterogeneous between previous studies and meta-analysis ( \u2013 ). Now, a tendentious consensus of no structural brain alterations is more acceptable by researchers ( ,  ). Furthermore, after rigorous literature screening, no morphometrical changes were detected with meta-analysis using different software. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe first quantitative coordinates meta-analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging studies for migraine that synthesized functional and structural MRI metrics, with the aim of providing the most comprehensive insights into brain impairments of migraine patients. Our meta-analysis suggested spontaneous cerebral activity in the left thalamus and brainstem, with no FC and GMV alterations. The findings may be served as the brain dysfunction clue of the underlying pathophysiology of migraine. In addition, neuroimaging meta-analysis, for reliable and robustness results, rigorous literature screening is prerequisite. \n\n\n## Limitation \n  \nFirstly, the heterogeneity analysis, and correlation analysis were not carried out due to the ALE software restriction. The number of included studies was insufficient to perform subgroup analysis. Secondly, unpublished studies (\u201cgray studies\u201d) were not included in our meta-analysis, which inevitably leads to publication bias. And the coordinates-based meta-analysis also has inherently biased, as it employs pooled stereotactic coordinates that are statistically significantly different, rather than raw data. Thirdly, this meta-analysis was limited to seed-based to whole-brain fMRI studies of FC, the studies using independent component analysis (ICA) and positron emission tomography (PET) approach not included. \n\n\n## Strengths and limitations of this study \n    \nFunctional and structural changes were evaluated simultaneously. \n  \nRobust results were attributed to the rigorous processing analyses. \n  \nMore studies are needed to verify the changes in GMV. \n  \n\n## Author contributions \n  \nZ-HC, Y-LC, J-TS, Y-TL, and CZ devoted to this study equally as the co-first authors.

Despite being harshly criticized in the past for failing to demonstrate robust correlations with behavioral measures, currently this construct is attracting a resurgent interest in cognitive neuroscience. Therefore, an updated examination of the validity of this construct is timely. A corpus of peer-reviewed literature was analyzed through meta-analysis, which compared the two main formats used to measure vividness [trial-by-trial vividness ratings (VR) and the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]. These two formats were compared in relation to all available behavioral/cognitive (BC) and neuroscience (NS) measures in Phase 1 (3542 statistical observations representing 393 journal articles); and then in relation to all available BC, EEG and fMRI literature in Phase 2 (3624 observations representing 402 articles). Both Phases observed significantly larger effect size estimates (ESEs) for VR than VVIQ, and larger ESEs for NS than BC measures. ESEs for EEG and fMRI were not significantly different in Phase 2, but were greater than BC ESEs. These data suggest VR are a more reliable self-report measure than VVIQ, and may reflect a more direct route of reportability than the latter. Furthermore, both VR and VVIQ are more strongly associated with the neural, than the cognitive and behavioural correlates of imagery. If one establishes neuroscience measures as the criterion variable, then self-reports of vividness show higher construct validity than behavioural/cognitive measures of imagery. We discuss how the present findings contribute to current issues on measurement of reportability; and how this study advances our understanding of vividness as a phenomenological characteristic of imagery, and other forms of conscious experience which do not necessarily involve imagery. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVisual mental imagery refers to the subjective experience of a percept-like pattern in the absence of a relevant physical stimulus on the retina ( ;  ). Historically,   was the first to observe that the \u201cdetail and clarity with which individuals experience mental imagery\u201d involves an individual difference gradient across a population, which he operationally defined as \u201cvividness.\u201d While much progress has been achieved in clarifying the neural and information processing nature of mental imagery, dimensions such as vividness, which concern the phenomenal experience of imagery, have potentially been neglected by contemporary cognitive psychology. Indeed, after  , in the last 15 years very few examples can be found in the literature attempting to readdress this topic and its ambiguousness [see  ] or situate it within the broader arena of consciousness research [see  ]. Correspondingly, it seems very little progress has been made in terms of a complete account of mental imagery which offers a constructive integration of its component dimensions \u2013 cognitive, affective, neural, and phenomenological [the term \u201cconstructive\u201d is borrowed from  ]. \n\nLack of progress in this direction is surprising, given that no author ever denies the experiential aspects of imagery (or, similarly, that vividness of imagery is relevant to the scientific study of inner experience). On the contrary, experiential aspects of mental imagery continue to be used circularly, and ubiquitously for defining the psychological status and relevance of mental imagery [for both points, see  ]. For example, imagery paradigms that require subjects to provide an observable objective behavior (e.g. a button press) in response to generating, holding or transforming images rely on subjects being aware that they are experiencing an image. Thus, objective responses during imagery tasks are incontrovertibly entangled with the report of phenomenological awareness [see  ]. Because conscious phenomenal awareness of the imagery experience is constitutive of what is reported (the content of conscious experience), the button press or other behavioral measures are not independent of the reported content ( ). In other words, there is no independent way of telling whether the button press or other behavioral measures involve visual mental imagery, unless the latter experience is explicitly reported by the subject. This type of circularity is generally acknowledged in the broader context within the study of visual consciousness ( ;  ). \n\nIn the \u201cimagery debate,\u201d two contending approaches provide the best accounts for several aspects of imagery, and still remain the most influential cognitive psychology approaches to its study. According to  \u2019s \u201cpictorial theory,\u201d visual mental images are constructed from depictive representations, which come into play at higher stages of visual information processing during actual perception. According to  \u2019s \u201ctacit knowledge,\u201d experimental data on visual mental images simply reflect different instances of what people implicitly know or believe about how they perceive. Although Kosslyn and Pylyshyn do not explicitly acknowledge, or refer to the vividness construct overtly in their theories, and both authors might even summarily dismiss the relevance of the vividness construct, they allude to it at several critical junctions in their explanatory arguments, as evidenced by the following examples. \n\nIn discussing the mental scanning paradigm and the size of mental images, to illustrate what tacit knowledge involves,  , p. 163) repeatedly refers to \u201cdetails\u201d represented in images and \u201cblurry\u201d versus \u201cclear\u201d images. These adjectives epitomize the two terms used to describe vividness, according to the classical definition of vividness in psychology ( ,  ;  ; note the historical reference has been introduced by the authors of the current paper, Pylyshyn did not mention it). Consequently, at least some of his key conclusions about self-reports assume the validity of the vividness measure is sufficient. \n\nOn the other hand, in a paper that set the methodology benchmark for a series of fMRI studies showing activation of V1 by visual imagery,   use the word vividness when describing their mental imagery model based on Hebb\u2019s cell assembly hypothesis; especially, in framing some aspects of their data. For example, when discussing the controversy concerning the reinterpretation of mental images ( ), these authors argue that past imagery reinterpretation tasks may have required high-resolution images. Cues were effective in facilitating reinterpretation because their \u201c\u2026 images were not very vivid\u201d ( , p. 286). Additionally, these authors defend another conclusion carefully stating that \u201c\u2026 additional effort is required in imagery to represent visual patterns with high resolution.\u201d However, resolution and vividness were equated earlier in the article: \u201ctranslated in our present understanding, more vivid images would occur when stored information activates lower areas, which have higher spatial resolution than do higher areas\u201d ( , p. 277). Correspondingly, at least some of the supporting explanations used by Kosslyn   et al.   go circularly back to vividness. \n\nEven if these authors do not acknowledge vividness as a classical and contemporary psychological construct, it is nonepiphenomenal in the context of their explanations, and cannot be eliminated, nor refuted at present. In addition, a number of imagery researchers have shown that properties available to self-report, such as the ones typically included in definitions of vividness can reflect the resolution of the visual buffer [see  ;  ]. Furthermore, at the crossroads with imagery \u2013 episodic memory and cognitive neuroscience \u2013 some investigators use self-report variables such as Paivio\u2019s imageability ( ), or other contextual variables in their experiments ( ) as an indirect way to observe, interpret, and discuss the underlying vividness of the cognitive event. Thus, it seems that contentions toward the validity of the vividness construct do not take in consideration subtle differences in how vividness is actually measured, or what vividness actually means. Reexamination of the construct of vividness is timely also because multiple versions of essentially a similar latent construct are increasingly being used in different areas of neuroscience and psychology related to, but other than mental imagery, such as prospective and episodic memory ( ), and aging ( ). Vividness is increasingly becoming a central topic for phenomenological, neurobiological, and genetic links between visual memory and emotion ( ). Thus, the concept has the potential to advance many fields of research, but presumably for structural and historical constraints, transdisciplinary integration of advances in knowledge seems to progress inductively, from more specific, particular topics (case in point, vividness in imagery) to the general (consciousness). \n\nWith such transdisciplinary background in mind, the purpose of the present article is to update the status of vividness. We attempt to achieve the goal by working toward a new way to substantiate the construct with empirically demonstrated validity, which includes current findings from neuroscience, among other different disciplines. Our approach to the study of the validity of vividness, however, is based on \u201creference\u201d rather than \u201cmeaning\u201d ( ). From this perspective, the crucial issue is not what \u201cvividness really means,\u201d but rather, to what extent our subjective measures of imagery vividness work; namely, whether they measure the intended core latent attribute of inner conscious experience that comes with having visual mental images. Therefore, we already make the prior assumption that there does exist, in reality, an attribute that one designates when using the term \u201cvividness.\u201d Following this approach, the issue of validity can be reduced to whether a measurement instrument is sensitive to variations of the assumed attribute ( ). Namely, the question becomes: what do subjective vividness instruments really measure? \n\nTo find out what is measured, one has to find out how the instrument works. Accordingly, the development of any construct requires the refinement of its operational definition, namely, defining the range of variation of the underlying assumed attribute, such that it can be calibrated more precisely against related psychological and neurophysiological variables ( ). For example, to illustrate one of the most relevant ambiguity that has been identified over the years, although vividness is operationally defined by the key words \u201cdetail\u201d and \u201cclarity,\u201d   observed a neurophysiological distinction between the vividness of a memory and the detail a memory possesses, as they relate to brain activation patterns. Such ubiquity could be interpreted as contradictory, but from the empirical point of view just confirms earlier phenomenological findings, that across several different instruction conditions, people seem to heed to, and report on, both an intensive aspect of the sensory strength of their images (or \u201cclarity,\u201d generally described as brightness and color) and the level of precision or \u201cdetail\u201d discerned within them ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs two very recent landmark studies show, the ubiquity that seems associated with the construct of vividness almost invariably reflects empirical variations in individual differences. On the one hand, it has been shown the overlap in neural activation (especially in the early primary visual cortex, V1) between imagery and perception is directly, positively correlated with trial by trial vividness ratings (VR) and imagery ability ( ). On the other hand, individual differences in the imagery experience are found to vary according to the two inversely correlated attributes associated with the size of V1. Individuals with above-average V1 size experience higher detailedness but lower sensory strength, whereas individuals with below-average V1 size show the opposite pattern (Bergman   et al.   2016). But most important, performance and verbal reports by the majority of people, with average V1 size, reflect a relative mixture of those two visual features of images. \n\nPrevious phenomenological and behavioral (Reaction Times modeling) evidence confirms the trend in the majority of the observers, and based on the weight of this evidence combined with neurophysiological data ( ;  ) some authors defend that it seems reasonable to assume as a definition of vividness the most exhaustive subjective conscious experience of imagery, in terms of both amount of detail (resolution) and sensory strength of a mental image, relative to the experience of actual seeing. The latter operational working definition is the frame of reference for the tests of validity proposed in this article. \n\nA line of thinking about validity similar to the one just discussed has led to some of the strongest arguments demarking the necessity and objectifiability of self-reports in cognitive neuroscience, and consciousness research more generally. Particularly relevant is   analysis of the \u201ctriangulation\u201d in consciousness research; namely, the convergent use of introspective, behavioral and neurophysiological evidence. As they argued, empirical validity of introspective reports cannot be only established by examining the relationship between reported vividness and other objective behavioral measures (e.g. memory accuracy). Rather, empirical validity should be based on the relationship between neural correlates of perceived vividness and reported vividness at the first-person level. Without considering perceived vividness (what the person is actually experiencing), the fact that reported vividness may not correlate with behavior does not refute the validity of the vividness construct. Crucially, reported vividness may still be strongly correlated with the neural correlates of perceived vividness experience. Because vividness was defined \u223c130 years ago, and its main synthetic assessment [the meta-analysis by  ] did not include current neuroscience findings, the construct requires an updated reconsideration as to what it actually means in the fields of consciousness and imagery at present. This effort may accommodate novel, contemporary conceptualizations concerning the nature of memory ( ), or even new knowledge regarding the neural basis of consciousness, such as the default mode network ( ). \n\nIn addition, as a psychological construct, vividness requires convergent and discriminative validation through empirical, objective testing. For instance, vividness has been positively correlated with performance on perceptual and memory tasks ( ;  ;  ), arousal level ( ;  ), and sleep stages ( ), even though it is debated whether or not it is correlated with certain dynamic spatial tasks like mental rotation ( ;  ). Moreover, a growing body of research suggests VR correlate with neural modulations in specific brain regions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which covary with the phenomenological ratings offered by participants. \n\nPerhaps the most commonly used global assessment of imagery ability is the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ;  ;  ;  ) and its successor the VVIQ2 ( ;  ). The VVIQ provides a global assessment of vividness, and is typically used to categorize participants according to the individual differences in visual imagery ability. It consists of 16 items, which are to be rated on a five-point scale from (1) \u201cperfectly clear and as vivid a normal vision,\u201d to (5) \u201cno image at all, you only \u2018know\u2019 that you are thinking of the object.\u201d The versatility of the VVIQ is such that it can be administered before, during, or after experimental manipulations, and demonstrates sufficient retest and internal reliability ( ). \n\nAlternatively, vividness may be rated on a \u201ctrial-by-trial\u201d VR basis through a single response, which corresponds to the subjective experience at a particular moment in time, structurally constrained by what types of images participants are required to form. In addition to methodological advantages,   argue that trial-by-trial VR are perhaps the most effective means by which imagery vividness can be studied (e.g.  ). Similarly, participants are prompted with a scale such as that used in the VVIQ, wherein vividness is rated from (1) \u201cno image,\u201d to (5) \u201cperfectly vivid\u201d (albeit the scale can range from 1 to 3, 1 to 7, 1 to 100, etc.). A major contention concerning the use of VVIQ is that global assessments offered through surveys of group differences in mental imagery ability may describe too coarsely, or even miss specific cognitive and neural processes affiliated with the phenomenological experience of vividness occurring within each trial ( ). \n\nThe reliability of vividness, as a construct presumed to reflect identifiable and separable processes, is largely undermined through the use of a single test score, such as the one offered by the VVIQ, or global assessments of imagery ability more generally ( ). In contrast, experimental procedures employing VR may procure more reliable patterns of results and interpretations than those employing the VVIQ ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). If VR are observed in structured experimental settings, and participants are given clear instructions as to the nature of the task, VR may resolve critically informative and specific aspects concerning the subjective experience of the imagery processes ( ). In this way, VR are a type of retrospective verbal report ( ), which can be put in correspondence with decomposable task-related behavior and neural processes. Accordingly, VR is compatible with the principle of \u201creportability,\u201d i.e., the more general condition with which the levels and contents of phenomenal conscious awareness in visual working memory can be properly defined and investigated ( ;  ). \n\nExperimental results which are based on behavioral, cognitive, or neuroscience types of measures are assumed to produce effects which vary in their relative sizes; however, there has been no systematic quantitative comparison that evaluates the claim, nor offers an evidence-based indication as to whether vividness provides weak or robust data [for a complete account of this debate, see  ]. Adopting a meta-analysis approach offers the opportunity to formulate a set of clear and straightforward hypotheses and predictions that could be put forward to empirical testing. Because VRs resolve critical aspects of, and measure a greater subset of the variability in the mental imagery experience, they may systematically demonstrate greater content validity than the VVIQ within behavioral, cognitive, and neuroscience experimental paradigms ( ;  ;  ;  ). Accordingly, one would expect larger effect sizes for VR [see  ]. If VR resolve phenomenological aspects of mental imagery to a greater degree than the VVIQ (i.e. they are more exhaustive), then the reported effect sizes pertaining to VR should be greater in magnitude than the effect sizes associated with the VVIQ, when averaged over a large and representative sample of relevant literature. To test this first key hypothesis, in the present meta-analysis, VR were compared against all available behavioral, cognitive, and neuroscience imagery measures throughout a robust and representative sample of literature with the VVIQ providing the criterion variable against which self-reports are traditionally compared and validated ( ). \n\nThe viability of an evidence-based approach to mental imagery is one which is theoretically driven by and supported through neurocomputational modeling ( ). In addition, neuroimaging experiments typically exhibit a great amount of control and precision ( ). Thus, the second hypothesis tested through the present meta-analysis was that neuroscience measures may resolve critical aspects of the mental imagery experience more reliably than behavioral and or cognitive ones, and as result, it would be possible to conclude that vividness may be more thoroughly validated as an independent and empirical construct through neuroscience approaches. If neuroscientific measures are capable of resolving phenomenological vividness more closely than behavioral and or cognitive ones, then the prediction follows that the reported magnitude of effect sizes which are neuroscience should be greater than those which are behavioral and or cognitive. Specifically, VRs should also be greater than the VVIQ for effect sizes which are associated with neuroscience measurements. The latter outcome would entail a broader implication in terms of how conscious verbal reports of imagery could be conceptualized. That is, imagery reportability may be associated with two routes, a \u201cdirect\u201d route, represented by VRs, and an indirect one, represented by VVIQ. Following   general typologies of verbal protocols, it would be reasonable to interpret the predicted pattern as an indication that VR and VVIQ may reflect two different processing routes supporting retrospective verbal reports as postulated in the schemas shown in  . Like other types of retrospective reports, VR are obtained by asking subjects about a neurocognitive process which recently occurred. It is reasonable that in structured conditions, in which VR are collected, the image contents may be accessed through a relatively more direct route, with minimal verbal recoding and delay that reflect predominantly or exclusively task-relevant information and processes ( , right panel). Conversely, in the case of VVIQ, VR may require additional scanning, filtering, inference or rule-based and metacognitive processes; as a result, verbalization may mediate or even modify the imagery experience revealing information or knowledge that goes beyond or is not relevant to processes underlying the task ( , left panel). \n  \nSchematic models representing types of VR (left panel: VVIQ; right panel: trial-by-trial VR) as particular cases of two retrospective verbal report processing routes, adapted from  . Like other types of retrospective reports, VR are obtained by asking subjects about a process which occurred recently. This figure shows the cases similar to introspection, in which VR requires scanning, filtering, inference, or rule-based processes, thus verbalization mediates or even modifies the imagery task. \n  \nA third hypothesis may also be derived as a possible contingency from the first two, if the presence of a significant interaction is observed between Vividness and Measure factors, it may represent a differential propensity for VR/VVIQ within the behavioral/cognitive (BC) and/or NS dimensions. Because the effect sizes for VR are hypothesized to exceed those of the VVIQ for both BC and NS measurements, failing to reject the null hypothesis for the interaction effect would imply the strongest form of convergent validation, and support for the first two hypotheses. \n\n\n## Method: Phase 1 \n  \n### Sampling \n  \nA corpus of peer-reviewed journal articles representing a robust subset of the relevant literature available through the databases Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO were retrieved through our University\u2019s library on October 25th, 2012.   A priori   criteria restricted the search results to those of the English language, to those published after 1950, and those using human subjects. Given the current major issues concerning the inclusion of \u201cgrey literature\u201d \u2013 such as poorer research quality, search un-standardization, data duplication and/or incompleteness, minimal reliability improvement at cost of major energy/resource search expenditure [see extensive review in  ] \u2013 theses, dissertations, and other unpublished works were deliberately avoided (a more detailed rationale for this decision contextualized to the present study is given in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d section). Data for Phase 1 are available upon request. \n\nSearch parameters included the general terms \u201cvivid* and image*\u201d, as well as additional syntax employed to minimize the discovery of irrelevant papers (see  ). A total of 1290 journal articles were discovered (Web of Knowledge, 36; Scopus, 34; Embase, 188; PsycINFO, 1032), and exported to RefWorks, wherein 320 duplicates were observed and deleted from the corpus. The remaining 970 journal articles were systematically analyzed in relation to their relevance to the research question. Those which did not include at least one relevant statistical outcome relating either vividness ratings (VR) and/or VVIQ to another variable were not considered further, of which there were 577. From the remaining 393 papers that contained at least one relevant statistical outcome, each and every statistical outcome relating either VR and/or VVIQ to another variable was recorded into a database, as it appeared in the original journal article. \n\n\n### Data trimming and data analysis \n  \nUpon inclusion into the database, every statistical outcome was categorized as either VR or VVIQ, and further categorized as either BC, or neuroscience (NS). A total of 3697 statistical outcomes were observed from the 393 papers included, which were organized into four focal categories (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20091826; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20091680; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200982; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u200962), and one peripheral category consisting of observations which directly correlated VR with VVIQ (  n  \u2009=\u200947). \n\nEach statistical outcome was transformed from its original statistical metric into the form of the correlation coefficient (  r  ), from which absolute Fisher\u2019s   Z   transformed score were computed. Statistical outcomes for which   r   could not be calculated were excluded from the analysis (  n  \u2009=\u2009108), such as beta-values (  n  \u2009=\u200973),   t  ,   F  ,   r, U  , and   q   values which did not included sufficient information (  n  \u2009=\u200935). Because scaling phenomenological ratings from 1 (low) to 5 (high), has the exact opposite meaning as scaling phenomenological ratings from 5 (low) to 1 (high), rearranging statistical outcomes to accommodate the scaling   post priori   was methodologically difficult. Subsequently, the present research abandoned directionality and transformed   Z   vector quantities to their absolute, scalar   Z   form. Observations directly measuring VR and VVIQ together were considered separately, such that an average correlation could be isolated. \n\nData were modeled with a series of three-level meta-analysis ( ;  ). Traditional meta-analytic approaches assume independence in the effect sizes ( ). As there are 3697 effect sizes nested within 393 studies in the present meta-analysis, statistical inferences of traditional meta-analysis are incorrect. Three-level meta-analysis enables researchers to implement an additional cluster effect (dependence within the same study). Although ignoring dependence is not recommended, aggregating multiple statistical outcomes into one summary statistic can likewise be problematic ( ), as it may afford larger standard errors affiliated with parameter estimates, and generally contributes to a high attrition rate (loss of sample size). As such, the present research necessitated a more precise and accommodating meta-analytic framework to answer the primary research question in Phase 2. Data were analyzed using R software, with the \u201cmetaSEM\u201d package ( ). The level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances represent the within- and between-study heterogeneity variances, respectively. If the level-2 heterogeneity variance is large, it means that the reported effect sizes also vary within the same study. \n\nCorrespondingly, data for VR  (  n  \u2009=\u20091760) represented 238 experiments from 194 journal articles, VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u20091640) represented 248 experiments from 212 journal articles, VR  (  n  \u2009=\u200980) represented 13 experiments from 13 journal articles, and VVIQ  (  n\u2009  =\u200962) represented 7 experiments from 7 journal articles. A 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 2 (BC, NS) study design was used to test the abovementioned research hypotheses (i) effect sizes on VR are larger than those on VVIQ; (ii) effect sizes on NS are larger than those on BC; and (iii) there is an interaction between these two factors. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA preliminary analysis was first performed, wherein a three-level meta-analytic framework was employed to determine the overall effect size estimate (ESE), and parameter estimates for the entire dataset. The average ESE (  Z  ) with its 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) was 0.4011 [0.3795, 0.4227], where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0434 and 0.0404, respectively. The test on the null hypothesis of equality of population level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances is not statistically significant, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20090.4913,   P\u2009=\u2009  0.4833. The percentage of variation accounted for at level-2 and level-3 (  I  ) were 0.4572 and 0.4249, respectively. This indicates the effect sizes have similar degree of variation within and between studies. Subsequently, a moderator variable was created for each focal category, and the data from each focal category were subjected to an independent three-level meta-analytic framework, such that an internal ESE for each category could be calculated. The ESE and parameter estimates for the four focal categories are presented in   and  . In comparison to the overall model, the effect of the moderator variables was statistically significant, \u03c7  (3)\u2009=\u200965.03,   P\u2009  <\u20090.001.\n   \nDescriptive statistics for phase 1, including the number of statistical outcomes, number of journal articles, number of experiments, ESEs, and 95% Wald CIs for each category \n  \n  \nInternal ESEs for each of the four categories in Phase 1, and their 95% Wald CIs. Also plotted are the predicted values from the regression analysis (dotted lines), which are based on the model without the interaction.   Note  : the 95% Wald CIs are based on the estimated values (not the predicted values). \n  \nA 2 Vividness (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 2 Measure (BC, NS) design was used to test the research hypotheses with a mixed-effects meta-analysis. The interaction between Vividness and Measure was not statistically significant \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20091.71,   P   = 0.19, which indicated that the effect of Vividness and Measure was additive. In other words, the effect of Vividness is independent of the effect of Measure (and vice versa). We may independently interpret the effects of Vividness and Measure. When there is an interaction, however, the effect of Vividness depends on the level of Measure (and vice versa). We need to select the level of Measure when we interpret the effect of Vividness (and vice versa). Both Vividness and Measures were significant \u03c7  (2)\u2009=\u200963.31,   P   < 0.001, level-3   R  \u2009=\u20090.182. The ESE for VR was statistically greater than VVIQ (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.133, 95% Wald CI [0.093, 0.173]), after controlling the effect of Measure. NS was statistically greater than BC (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.257, 95% Wald CI [0.150, 0.364]), after controlling the effect of Vividness. Finally, concerning the peripheral analysis examining the direct relationship between VR and VVIQ, the results from 47 effect sizes nested within 19 studies using a three-level meta-analysis suggests an ESE of 0.3977 (0.2886, 0.5069), where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0260 and 0.0293, respectively. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results from the Phase 1 offered significant insight into the ESEs for each of the four focal categories. Although the differences between VR and VVIQ appear to be robust within the BC dimension, the differences within the NS dimension were not as clear cut. Nevertheless, the peripheral category directly correlating VR and VVIQ suggests a weak to moderate relationship. Comparisons concerning the NS dimension did not resolve any differences between VR and VVIQ; however, this effect may have remained unresolved for at least two reasons. First, standard error (SE) within each of the NS focal categories was larger than those within the BC focal categories, which resulted from a much smaller sample size, and a much larger estimate of within study variance (  \u1e7d\u2019  ). Secondly, between-study heterogeneity (  \u03c4  ) was generally larger within the NS focal categories. \n\nTwo strategies were implemented to homogenize the NS focal categories. First, because no future searches indicated additional evidence pertaining to PET (  n  \u2009=\u20095), NIRS (  n  \u2009=\u20096), or pharmacological NS (  n  \u2009=\u20094) neuroscience outcomes, and to avoid overestimating between study error, only fMRI (  n  \u2009=\u200973), and EEG (  n  \u2009=\u200954) were selected as representative to the NS sample. Incidentally, this methodological conceptualization may lend insight into temporal specific (EEG) and spatial specific (fMRI) variations in neurophysiological measurement within this construct. If indicative, a differential propensity for the NS dimension may be observed between fMRI and EEG, a pattern of which should be emergent between both VR and VVIQ. Secondly, another systematic literature search was performed to acquire previously undiscovered journal articles pertaining to VR and VVIQ in the context of NS, but specifically those relating to fMRI and/or EEG. \n\n\n## Method: Phase 2 \n  \n### Sampling \n  \nIn an effort to clarify the meaning of the NS data specifically, an exhaustive systematic search was performed, which sought to discover any and all journal articles relating VR and/or VVIQ to EEG and/or fMRI. Four strategies were employed. First, PsychINFO was searched on July 20th, 2015, using the specific parameters \u201cvivid* fMRI\u201d, and \u201cvivid* EEG\u201d, from which six novel journal articles were discovered ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) resulting in 37 novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200930; VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20094; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20093; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Similar searches through PsychINFO for VVIQ did not return any results. \n\nSecond, the entire library catalog in our institution was searched on July 20th, 2015 using the specific parameters \u201cVVIQ fMRI,\u201d and \u201cVVIQ EEG,\u201d from which three novel journal articles were discovered ( ;  ;  ), resulting in 27 novel observations (VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20096; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u200921). \n\nThird, the discussion sections of all relevant papers were read, and references were recorded for comparisons the authors sought to explain their findings. This resulted in an additional two novel journal articles ( ;  ), resulting in 29 novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200928; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20091; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Finally, a journal article known to be relevant ( ), and published in a pilot study through this research group, and not found in any other search was also included, resulting in four novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20094; VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Data for Phase 2 are available upon request. \n\n\n### Data trimming and data analysis \n  \nThe novel fMRI and EEG data from Phase 2 were compiled with existing fMRI and EEG data from Phase 1. Subsequently, the entire NS database consisted of 224 observations. Data for VR  (  n  \u2009=\u2009102) represented 13 experiments from 13 journal articles, VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u200943) represented eight experiments from eight journal articles, VR  (  n  \u2009=\u200935) represented six experiments from six journal articles, and VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u200944) represented four experiments from four journal articles. BC data from Phase 1 were also borrowed from Phase 1, resulting in a 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 (BC, EEG, fMRI) study design. Phase 2 data were modeled in the same way as Phase 1. A 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 (BC, EEG, fMRI) study design was used to test the abovementioned research hypotheses (i) effect sizes on VR are larger than those on VVIQ; (ii) effect sizes on EEG and fMRI are larger than those on BC; and (iii) there is an interaction between these two factors. \n\nDuring the interval of time required for peer-review, a final library search was conducted to double check that the database was still representative of the very latest publications. The search revealed that only three new (fMRI) papers published during the peer-review lag ( ;  ;  ) fitting the inclusion criteria were not included in our revised analysis. All the data points from these papers were observed to fall within the 95% CIs calculated in Phase 2 ( ).\n   \nDescriptive statistics for phase 2, including the number of statistical outcomes, number of journal articles, number of experiments, ESEs, and 95% Wald CIs for each category \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA preliminary analysis was first performed, wherein a three-level meta-analytic framework was employed to determine the overall ESE, and parameter estimates for the entire dataset. The average ESE (  Z  ) with its 95% Wald CI was 0.4080 [0.3854, 0.4306], where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0427 and 0.0472, respectively. The test on the null hypothesis of equality of population level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances is not statistically significant, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20091.03,   P\u2009=\u2009  0.31. Therefore, the percentage of variation accounted for at level-2 and level-3 (  I  ) were 0.4214 and 0.4660, respectively. This indicates the effect sizes have similar degree of variation within and between studies. Subsequently, a moderator variable was created for each focal category, and the data from each focal category were subjected to an independent three-level meta-analytic framework, such that an internal ESE for each category could be calculated. The ESE and parameter estimates for the six focal categories are presented in   and  . In comparison to the overall model, the effect of the moderator variables was statistically significant, \u03c7  (5)\u2009=\u200976.77,   P\u2009  <\u20090.001. \n  \nInternal ESEs for each of the six categories in Phase 2, and their 95% Wald CIs. Also plotted are the predicted values from the regression analysis (dotted lines), which are based on the model without the interaction.   Note  : the 95% Wald CIs are based on the estimated values (not the predicted values). \n  \nA 2 Vividness (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 Measure (BC, EEG, fMRI) design was used to test the research hypotheses with a mixed-effects meta-analysis. The interaction between Vividness and Measure was not statistically significant \u03c7  (2)\u2009=\u20091.14,   P   = 0.57, which indicated that the effect of Vividness and Measure was additive. In other words, the effect of Vividness is independent of the effect of Measure (and vice versa). Both Vividness and Measures were significant \u03c7  (3)\u2009=\u200975.63,   P   < 0.001, level-3   R  \u2009=\u20090.214. The ESE for VR was statistically greater than VVIQ (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.137, 95% Wald CI [0.095, 0.178]), after controlling the effect of Measure. By using BC as the reference group, EEG was statistically greater than BC (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.229, 95% Wald CI [0.079, 0.379]), and the predicted ESE for fMRI was likewise statistically greater than BC (  \u0394Z  \u2009=\u20090.297, 95% Wald CI [0.184, 0.410], after controlling the effect of Vividness. There was no difference between the ESE for EEG and the ESE for fMRI, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20090.52,   p\u2009=\u2009  0.47. \n\n\n## General Discussion \n  \nThe present research analyzed a robust and representative subset of literature in an effort to understand the relationship between trial-by-trial VR and VVIQ, within the context of behavioral/cognitive (BC) and neuroscience (NS) experimental paradigms in Phase 1, and within the context of BC, EEG, and fMRI experimental paradigms in Phase 2. \n\nThrough the preliminary analysis in Phase 1, a significant difference between the ESEs for VR and VVIQ in the context of BC experimentation was observed. This result is limited in so far as we assume the effect sizes used to create the database have the same statistical meaning, and that there are no systematic differences between the way in which VR and VVIQ are implemented in research. For example, it is possible that VVIQ is more conducive to between-groups comparison, and VR more conducive to within-group comparisons, which may imply the latter has inherently greater effect sizes. It is unlikely, however, that this limitation can account for the differences which were observed across these multiple domains of psychology and neuroscience. For example, the average correlation between VR and VVIQ was generally weak (  r   \u223c 0.40), for two measures which purportedly \u201cmeasure\u201d the same thing [note the correlation reported here is similar to the one reported by  ]. Although differences between VR and VVIQ were observed in Phase 1, the methodology utilized in Phase 2 sought to homogenize, and increase the sample size of the NS dimension, such that differences between the ESEs for VR and VVIQ could be observed within the NS dimension as well. \n\nThe statistical methodology employed in Phase 2 was designed to evaluate the data at different levels. Data were first analyzed at an overall level, then analyzed at theoretically determined levels, which were represented by six independent categories belonging to BC, EEG, or fMRI experimental types. The three-level meta-analysis provides a correct statistical model to handle multiple effect sizes nested within studies ( ). The ESE, when calculated over the entire dataset was approximately   Zr  \u2009=\u20090.40. Interestingly, the level-2 and level-3 estimates of heterogeneity, or the proportion of variation accounted for at each level (  I  ), show a similar magnitude (\u223c0.42, and \u223c0.47, respectively). This finding may suggest just as much variation exists within experiments as between. Finally, the unique contributions of Vividness and Measure were tested by a three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis with the data from Phase 2. \n\nThe results did not support the interaction between Vividness and Measure. This seems to suggest that the effects of Vividness and Measures are additive. On the other hand, the results provided strong support for both major hypotheses. VR demonstrated larger ESEs than the VVIQ, when compared against a large and representative sample, and larger ESEs were also observed for EEG and fMRI when compared with BC. Although BC experimental paradigms generally result in smaller ESEs, no significant difference was observed between EEG and fMRI neuro-imaging experiment types; albeit, the small sample sizes do not lend to a strong conclusion. Although fMRI has a tendency to overinflate effect sizes in some psychological contexts ( ), presumably based on statistical power, and limitations arising from small sample sizes ( ), the results of the present analysis do not suggest the ESE for fMRI data deviate significantly from EEG data. However, differences between VR and VVIQ remained unobserved within the EEG dimension, as this level of analysis was presumably limited by very small sample sizes (six and four experiments, respectively). \n\nIn relation to other subjective measures used in consciousness research, vividness could be interpreted as the measurement of a specific type of conscious experience, correlate of imagery. Although there have been very few studies comparing imagery vividness to the different types of subjective scales used in consciousness research such as the perceptual awareness scale (PAS, e.g.  ) or confidence ratings (CR, e.g.,  ), few older studies (pre-dating PAS creation) which compared VR in perception and imagery seem to show robust relationships ( ;  ). Relatively more studies showed that VVIQ, and to some extent VR, are correlated with CR [see  , for review; see also  ] in that as people rate themselves as having relatively more vivid images, they are also more confident about their imagery-related ability and performance (and females do so more than males). In addition, in his meta-analysis   reported on a subset of 15 studies correlating VVIQ and objective responses and subjective judgments in perceptual tasks, with composite effect size of   r  \u2009=\u20090.45 [95% CI\u2009=\u20090.31, 0.56]. Thus, issues of reportability for subjective measures of awareness used in consciousness research can shed some insights into vividness as a characteristic of conscious experiences in general. As reviewed by  , the validity and reliability of subjective measures of conscious awareness can be assessed through a set of reportability criteria: \u201cexhaustiveness\u201d (of all relevant contents in consciousness) and \u201cexclusiveness\u201d (of relevant conscious processes but not unconscious or irrelevant conscious ones), as well as how \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d the scales, ratings or reports, measure these attributes in underlying processes as defined by reference to objective measurements. Similar criteria can be applied to VR and VVIQ to better understand vividness as an attribute of visual consciousness. Hence, where relevant in the following discussion, we will highlight points of connection and the reciprocal implications for vividness as type-specific imagery experience measure and as an attribute sharing aspects common to other forms of consciousness as measured by PAS, CR, and other subjective measures. \n\nIf we consider VR as an entire set of all phenomenological experiences we can probe (we can ask participants to rate the vividness of mental images generated in any number of single trials), the VVIQ can only approximate this set, as it makes a series of vividness measurements from a small, standardized subset of all possible mental images we can imagine. Albeit, the questions used in the VVIQ may be highly exemplary/representative of the general vividness construct. According to this reasoning, the VVIQ is a robust subset of all VR. Although the 16 or 32 items on the VVIQ/VVIQ2 possess excellent content validity, they cannot accommodate special circumstances in human psychological experience, like those concerning flash-bulb memories in PTSD, or vivid mental images as they relate to mental health more generally ( ). As such, the greater effect sizes observed for VR observations is likely the surplus of what the VVIQ cannot measure. If VR can be seen as a specific type of subjective awareness measure such as PAS or CR used in consciousness research, then VR can be said to be more \u201cexhaustive\u201d than VVIQ as a measure of the conscious states associated with imagery, in that it reveals most of the relevant knowledge of the conscious state experienced by the imager. \n\nIn comparison to BC, larger ESEs were observed for EEG and fMRI experimental paradigms, which may lend weight to the interpretation that, when behavioral and cognitive factors are ruled-out, something extra remains unexplained in the statistical model, yet is captured by neuroimaging studies. Vividness ratings can be captured on a millisecond to millisecond temporal basis (EEG), and in a millimeter to millimeter spatial basis (fMRI), in a way which most closely approximates the conscious \u201cpsychological\u201d experience of the mental image. NS experimental paradigms allow for the resolution of specific and intrinsic processes, closely following the human psychological experience of vividness, which is an otherwise unobservable phenomenon. Given this interpretation requires extensive support, Phase 2 was designed to exhaustively retrieve any and all evidence linking vividness to brain modulation. A series of searches afforded 29 relevant papers, representing 224 effect sizes, which were statistically modeled with a series of three-level meta-analyses. The three-level meta-analysis has high statistical power as it includes all effect sizes and models the dependence of the data properly. The significance of the present results is contingent on the weight of a corpus of BC experimentation, which showed a similar pattern, but with a much larger sample size \u2013 and thusly \u2013 contribution to the overall analysis. \n\nAs previously mentioned, one possible limitation to the present analysis may be that VR and VVIQ correspond to different methodological designs, and the inherent lack of heterogeneity between these measures may warrant careful reconsideration of the abovementioned interpretation. However, systematic differences in the way VR and VVIQ are administered, if any, are marginal at best, and cannot account for the present pattern of results. First, the correlation between the VVIQ and VR was weak to moderate. Secondly, the present argument can be thought of as a trade-off in the implementation of the VVIQ, where the convenience of administering a questionnaire (which measures trait ability) sacrifices resolution moment-to-moment. VRs seem to reasonably resolve the spectrum of variability in the mental imagery experience (which can be assumed to include measurement of both trait and state ability). It is this variability which can be more sensitively correlated to modulations in brain activity, which exist within a narrow temporal and/or spatial window, the likes of which a questionnaire cannot impute. Just to clarify with an example, our scores on the VVIQ may very well be the same, but the vividness of events relating to my PTSD (if I suffered from it), would be wildly different than yours (if you did not). Such situational variability may be consistent with flash-bulb memories, pharmaceutical interventions, hallucinations, or dreams. Furthermore, we do acknowledge that the practical interpretability of the average effect size for each main category may be limited (for predictive purposes). However, the relativistic differences (VR\u2009>\u2009VVIQ) are sufficiently accurate, robust, withstanding replication and convergent validation. \n\nAnother potential limitation is that there is a disparity between the number of studies as well as the number of effect sizes in Phase I (VRBC,   n\u2009  =\u20091826; VVIQBC,   n  \u2009=\u20091680; VRNS,   n  \u2009=\u200982; VVIQNS,   n  \u2009=\u200962). This disparity indicates that traditionally BC has been much more studied than NS. The estimated average effects (VR versus VVIQ and BC versus NS) are still unbiased regardless of the disparity of the number of effect sizes. On the other hand, the estimated heterogeneity variances are likely biased toward BC as there are more studies in BC. \n\nThere are pros and cons of including unpublished studies in a meta-analysis.   argued against including unpublished studies. For example, unpublished studies are usually of weaker methodology. Moreover, the search for unpublished studies may also be biased due to the availability of unpublished studies to the authors. On the other hand,   provided counter arguments for including unpublished studies. They suggested unpublished studies may be excluded on the methodological rigorousness by using clearly defined inclusion criteria rather than excluding all unpublished studies. The present study only included effect sizes from published studies because we wanted to include peer-reviewed studies with rigorous methodology. However, we do not think that the presence of unpublished studies may alter our conclusions because there are more than 3600 effect sizes nested within about 400 studies. It is not feasible to find enough unpublished studies with null effect substantially changing our conclusions. \n\nIf one considers the totality of the available data in comparison to theoretically established categories, cluster/types of research can be independently identified, and decomposed from the overall analysis. The entire BC dimension could, by necessity, be further reduced into cluster/types (as were EEG and fMRI data decomposed from the Phase 1\u2009NS dimension), which can then be objectively compared, contrasted, and evaluated. In fact, the 32-month delay between the searches in both Phases represents a temporal necessity, allowing the collection of an incremental amount of literature pertaining to the spatial/temporal imaging of vividness, which remains a specialist field of ongoing research debate. After this interval of time, enough literature was compiled to reflect trends previously observed within the BC dimension. The replication of low \u201coverall\u201d effect sizes throughout the BC subdimensions is a consistent finding; here, \u0394  Zr   (\u223c0.14) is estimated to be the general differential throughout every possible subset comparison of VR and VVIQ within the BC dimension. The estimation is supported at an overall level, theoretically relevant NS levels, and replicated in two previous smaller subset analyses ( ;  ). \n\nThe question is, then, at what \u201clevel\u201d does one want to cluster the BC subsets? At some point, researchers are required to make a conceptual distinction between two or more types of research within an overall dataset. Indeed, \u201cBehavioural\u201d experimentation compared to \u201cCognitive\u201d experimentation may be the simplest BC comparison one could make, the effect of which was already measured as 0.40 \u201coverall\u201d \u2013 the VRs \u223c 0.46, and the VVIQs \u223c 0.32. Conversely, if one wants to make absolutely no assumptions concerning heterogeneity, only direct correlations between VR and VVIQ can be considered valid comparisons (because they are within studies, and unambiguously summarize the relationship), the effect size of which is similarly \u223c0.40. Making relevant theoretical distinctions [qualified by theory, quantified by estimates of heterogeneity (\u03c4 )] enables meta-analysis. For example, by concentrating research efforts on peer-reviewed quality reports and filtering out the gray literature, an acceptable level of journal quality heterogeneity was assumed, which was defined by the requirement of empirically evaluated, evidenced-based research ( ). \n\nFundamentally, the consistent observation that ESEs for VR exceed those of VVIQ suggests convergent validation, and under such circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that VR is a more reliable self-report measure than VVIQ. In this context, however, we can go a step further and define \u201cmore reliable\u201d concretely in terms of underlying processes, which are related to reportability. That is, the present findings support the conclusion that VR offer a relatively more direct report of imagery, in that they may be more sensitive to immediate, unfiltered information about the visual qualities of mental images relevant to a task or a resting condition, and may show knowledge that is relatively more exclusive to sensory-perceptual consciousness. In contrast, VVIQ is more indirect, since it could include higher-order and metacognitive processes related to the self-judged expected ability to generate at will a visual image that corresponds to a complex scene (which includes relatively more abstract knowledge, and needs to be translated from a fairly complex verbal narrative). In many respects, the difference between VR and VVIQ parallels the difference between PAS and CR in consciousness research, where the former measure has been shown to be correlated more with perception than metacognition, whereas the latter shows the opposite pattern of correlation ( ). All the pros and cons of using PAS and CR, as those authors have well pointed out, also apply for VR and VVIQ. For example, both vividness measures might fail in being exclusive, because they might reflect information below the level the experimenter is interested in, or because unconscious processes may exert an influence by boosting or attenuating the ratings. However, it is unclear whether a \u201creverse subtractive logic\u201d can be pursued in comparing proportions of accounted variation in the data between VR and VVIQ, as it could be done for PAS and other subjective awareness measures. Could we infer that the differential \u201cunexplained\u201d variance between VR and VVIQ indicates underlying overflow conscious processes plus underlying unconscious processes? This is an interesting empirical question for future research. \n\nThe operational partition in neural and behavioural processes is a feature derived from the way the field has historically developed, and it reflects a legitimate reduction of the investigative approach: it is not practical, nor scientifically necessary to consider all possible variables and measures. However, it still remains that such partition is artificial. Phenomenology, neural, cognitive and behavioral processes are all components of an integrated system. The finding that both VR and VVIQ are more strongly associated with the neural components of imagery generation than the cognitive and behavioral ones implies that if neural measures are considered the third independent criterion of reference for validity, then VR, regardless of the route of reportability they implement \u2013 VR or VVIQ \u2013 may in some circumstances be more valid than behavioral (and cognitive) measures. The findings and theoretical implications of the present meta-analysis lend support to the view that typical findings in the literature which show low correlations between self-report and behavioral measures should not be necessarily interpreted as a weakness of the former, rather the latter. Studies that do not adopt a single behavioral measure as the gold standard and criterion variable, and use multiple formats of the construct of interest, show that construct validity coefficients of self-reports such as VR are invariably greater than their behavioral counterparts [see review in  ].As earlier noted by  , self-reports are an aspect of consciousness that needs to be established with brain patterns, to explain the nature of experience. Inevitably, they need to be understood. However, our \u201capproximation\u201d of what the sentient unit is experiencing at any particular moment in time grows as we fumble with reductionism, and deconstruction, consistent with an information-processing approach. Validity of vividness seems to be proportional to the correlation between vividness consciously experienced and vividness verbally reported, and it is a misjudgment to assume we cannot trust subject\u2019s verbal interpretations of their own conscious states. In other words, it is a misjudgment to assume that validity needs to be established only by robust correlations with behavioral measures. \n\nThe previous conclusion has all but a trivial implication since the data we have presented clearly do not support current approaches which call for \u201celiminating\u201d subjective measures, thereby only focusing on the relationship between behavioral and neural measures of conscious processes [see again  ]. Expanding on the Jack and Roepfstorff\u2019s triangulation challenge,  , p. 9) offered a compelling argument that from a possible lack of correlation between vividness and behavioral accuracy (for instance in memory), it is not possible to refute the correspondence between vividness measures and actual experienced vividness. The accuracy of the vividness measures may still be valid even if there is no correspondence between behavioral accuracy and experienced vividness. Our study contributes to this specific argument in showing that, empirically, brain activity measures correspond closely to vividness measures, and to a lesser degree to cognitive and behavioral measures. Consequently, matters appear to be a bit more complex: it is not so much about the absence of correspondence, since across many experiments all the terms in the set of relationships are to some extent reciprocally correlated. It is about the strength of the correlations, i.e., empirically what matters is the degree of precision (reliability) for which some relationships stand out more than others. \n\n\n## Vividness and Consciousness: Theoretical Underpinnings of Validity \n  \nFinally, we would like to discuss some implications of a more general, less technical nature concerning how this study is situated to advance our understanding of vividness and consciousness in general. That is, in terms of the validity approach we have taken this is the next logical step: we attempt here to provide a full blown (albeit concise) theory of the structure of the attribute which the term vividness refers to. \n\nThe present study is compatible with a tenet that is widely held in some current neurobiological theories of consciousness. In brief, that sensory-affective (not exclusively/necessarily visual) mental images, defined as objective \u201cisomorphic neural maps\u201d associated with external and inner (somatic) environmental input, can constitute the first-order basic building block of consciousness during both perception and memory of perception [for review see  ]. Within this broader theoretical framework, a corollary that can be added through this study is that vividness expresses the graded isomorphic aspect of the conscious experience that more or less directly and immediately arises from the brain\u2019s complex processing of sensory-affective information in perception and memory. That is, vividness could be conceived as a particular isomorphism or equivalence mapping function ( ) that goes beyond the \u201cturned on\u201d consciousness state; as it expresses changes and states of inner experience in terms of equivalent graded levels of knowledge. In this context, vividness may have the role of making explicit the level or strength of the isomorphic correspondence between the inner first-person experience of the input and the environmental input itself ( ). In other words, measurements of vividness, notably through VR, reflect the gradient of immediate conscious experience of images that mirror isomorphic objective neural processes during perception and memory. Thus, vividness can be considered a chief phenomenological feature of primary sensory consciousness, and it supports the idea that consciousness is a graded phenomenon. \n\nThe concept of vividness however can be extended to a number of other types of consciousness. Isomorphic maps may develop into and become embedded in more complex and dynamic neurofunctional structures [\u2018nested neural hierarchies\u2019  ; \u201cactivity cycles\u201d ( )] that include emotions, plans, goals and actions, etc., which are removed from immediate environmental inputs or memory of them, in other words, states of consciousness other than those associated with perception and memory. These states may involve derivative \u201csecond-order\u201d isomorphic correspondences ( ) whose organization is not in forms of maps, but complex multidimensional patterns [e.g. the computational conceptual structures described by  ]. In this other context, vividness may be recycled to express graded knowledge of conscious experience that may or may not be linked with any first-order isomorphic representations, and it may or may not recycle sensory-affective isomorphic maps in memory. In these cases, vividness may express conscious knowledge even though it is not necessarily experienced in the form of mental images. Hence, vividness may have also an important role in accounting for phenomenal conscious processes associated with mental simulation ( ), analogical reasoning ( ), and strategies and metacognition ( ). As suggested by our findings, VVIQ may be a particularly sensitive measure of vividness when the latter cases involve imagery. However, other subjective or indirect computational measures could be devised to indicate how vividness captures other aspects of conscious knowledge which do not involve or require mental images at all ( ). Indeed, as mentioned in the introduction, we believe one of the most promising potential future contributions of the construct of vividness may be allowing a constructive integration of the roles of emotions, motives and goals within neurocognitive and epigenetic theories of imagery and consciousness. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAlthough the first attempt to validate the vividness construct through meta-analysis can be attributed to  , his detailed and systematic study was limited to the VVIQ. The VVIQ became the most widely used, standard tool by which vividness, and imagery self-reports are studied ( ), but this conclusion may be predicated on an erroneous assumption. The present analysis suggests the study of vividness, and researcher conceptualization of it more generally, needs to be reconsidered. In addition, it suggests that the construct of vividness may be most thoroughly studied using neuroscience methodologies that do not necessarily have observable behavioural outputs, such that phenomenological self-reports may be reliably and validly associated with neural correlates on a trial-by-trial basis. Capitalizing on the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of its validity, the concept of vividness can explain key aspects of the phenomenological experience of mental imagery, but it can be applied beyond, extending to other forms of conscious awareness, which do not necessarily involve imagery. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6007154, "text_md5": "79437b48cd23a4d5a48a05c8b5c22e27", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 60], "journal": [61, 79], "publication_year": [81, 85], "title": [96, 245], "keywords": [259, 341], "abstract": [354, 2265], "body": [2274, 64598]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30042840, "doi": "10.1093/nc/nix006", "pmcid": "6007154", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007154", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6007154"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007154\">6007154</a>", "list_title": "PMC6007154  Meta-analytic comparison of trial- versus questionnaire-based vividness reportability across behavioral, cognitive and neural measurements of imagery"}

Thus, tau-PET may allow precision-medicine prediction of individual tau-related cognitive trajectories, which can be important for determining patient-specific cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe included Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal,   n   = 121) or Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively normal to dementia,   n   = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for independent validation (controls/Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum=46/65). All participants underwent baseline  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial   R  ) between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to capture patient-specific cognitive decline. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99\u00b17.69] and A05 [age = 74.03\u00b19.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCombining tau-PET with task-fMRI-derived maps of major cognitive domains facilitates the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. This approach may help to increase the sensitivity to detect Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related cognitive decline and to determine personalized cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-022-01105-5. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau pathology ensuing neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [ ,  ]. While neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers of A\u03b2 and tau are routinely established for AD diagnosis [ ,  ], reliable prognosis of cognitive decline remains a critical challenge, which is further complicated by the considerable heterogeneity in symptom manifestation and disease progression [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAccurate prediction of cognitive decline in AD will be, however, particularly important for clinical trials to (i) stratify patients by progression risk and/or (ii) determine patient-specific clinical endpoints that allow sensitive assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories within trial-typical 1\u20132-year follow-ups [ ,  ,  ]. Elevated tau-PET is closely associated with the development of cognitive deficits in AD, and recent studies also support tau-PET as a promising prognostic marker for cognitive decline, outperforming the prognostic accuracy of amyloid-PET and MRI-assessed neurodegeneration [ \u2013 ]. Specifically, elevated tau-PET has been associated with faster global cognitive decline and clinical conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Moreover, cross-sectional studies reported that tau-PET patterns closely mirror clinical AD heterogeneity, including occipital tau-PET in posterior cortical atrophy (i.e., visual-variant AD), left-hemispheric tau-PET in language-variant AD, and mesial-temporal-lobe tau in amnestic AD [ ,  ]. This suggests a strong clinico-pathological correspondence between symptom manifestation and tau-PET patterns. Thus, mapping tau-PET to brain networks associated with cognitive domains typically affected in AD may allow the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline, to facilitate the assessment of patient-specific cognitive trajectories in clinical trials targeting tau pathology [ ]. \n\nTo test this, we obtained data from two independent cohorts from the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI,   N   = 261) and the A05 cohort (  N   = 111) covering healthy controls (i.e., cognitively normal A\u03b2\u2212) and AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) with baseline flortaucipir tau-PET and amyloid-PET. Further, all participants were characterized on different cognitive domains including episodic memory (MEM), language (LAN), executive functioning (EF), and visuospatial abilities (VS) across ~1.5\u20132 years of follow-up, which matches follow-up periods of several recent phase 2b&3 clinical trials (e.g., EMERGE/ENGAGE) [ ]. To assess the association between tau-PET and cognitive-domain-specific decline, we obtained meta-analytical maps of task-fMRI studies from Neurosynth [ ,  ] to determine brain regions that are consistently associated with MEM/LAN/EF/VS across ~1900 task-fMRI studies. We then mapped patient-specific tau-PET to cognitive-domain-specific brain activation maps and tested whether determining baseline tau-PET in regions involved in a given cognitive domain improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global/temporal-lobe tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) that have been suggested as prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Lastly, we used tau-PET predicted domain-specific decline to compute patient-specific weighted cognitive composites, which we hypothesized to capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories more sensitively than commonly used cognitive outcomes. Using simulated interventions, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed cognitive composites (i.e., personalized endpoints) [ ] improve the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional cognitive scores. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### ADNI \n  \nWe included 261 ADNI participants (inclusion criteria:  ) based on the availability of  F-florbetapir/ F-florbetaben amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (>1 follow-up), demographics (age, sex, education), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. All baseline data were obtained within 6 months; clinical status was classified by ADNI investigators as cognitively normal (CN, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] \u2265 24, Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0, non-depressed), MCI (MMSE \u2265 24, CDR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living), or demented (MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD). Subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. Ethics approval was obtained by ADNI investigators; all study participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n#### A05 \n  \nA total of 111 participants were selected from the AVID-1451-A05 phase 2/3 trial (NCT02016560; inclusion criteria:  ), based on the availability of  F-florbetapir amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (\u2265 1follow-up), demographics (age, sex), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. Continuous measures on years of education were not available for all participants and thus not included. All baseline data were obtained within 30 days. Participants were classified as CN (MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment), MCI (24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ], and AD dementia (10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ]. As for ADNI, subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. The study was approved by the clinical investigator\u2019s local Institutional Review Board; all participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n\n### fMRI meta-analyses of cognitive-domain-specific brain activation and tau-PET assessments \n  \nTo determine tau-PET in regions that are critical for a given cognitive domain (i.e., MEM/LAN/EF/VS), we obtained meta-analytical brain activation maps from task-based fMRI studies from Neurosynth ( , see Additional file  : Methods) using the search terms:   episodic memory   (included studies,   N   = 332),   language   (included studies,   N   = 1101),   executive control   (included studies,   N   = 230), and   visuospatial   (included studies,   N   = 267). Methodological details on Neurosynth-based meta-analyses have been described previously (see  ) [ ]. Cognitive-domain-specific meta-analytical task-fMRI maps were binarized and masked with cortical gray matter to exclude typical tau-PET off-target binding regions (i.e., hippocampus/subcortex) [ ,  ] and applied to spatially normalized SUVR-transformed tau-PET images to extract tau-PET signal within cognitive-domain-specific brain regions (for details on PET acquisition and preprocessing see Additional file  : Methods). To further minimize influences of flortaucipir off-target binding, we used voxel-wise two-component Gaussian-mixture-modeling to transform SUVRs to tau-positivity probabilities (TPP) [ ,  ]. Repeating this procedure for each task-fMRI map yielded cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET signals for MEM/LAN/EF/VS (Fig.  A, B (I)). To compare the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting cognitive trajectories against conventional tau-PET measures, we obtained global and temporal-lobe tau-PET SUVRs, which have been previously shown to capture AD-related tau accumulation and predict cognitive decline [ ,  ,  ,  ]. For global tau-PET, we determined average neocortical tau-PET, while excluding typical off-target binding regions (hippocampus, subcortex, cerebellum [ ,  ]; Fig.  B (II)). The temporal-lobe ROI included Braak-stage ROIs 1, 3, and 4 (Fig.  B (II)) [ ,  ].   \nGeneration of meta-analytical task-fMRI maps for assessing cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET (  A  ), surface rendering of regions of interests (ROIs) applied to tau-PET (  B  ), and analysis flowchart (  C  ). First, we compared the predictive accuracy of global tau-PET, temporal tau-PET, and cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline using bootstrapped linear regressions. Note that separate regression models were run for each tau-PET ROI   (CI)  . Second, we ran 1000 bootstrapped linear regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ and extracted beta values for each variable of the regression model (  CII  ), which were later used for assessing patient-specific cognitive composites in both ADNI A\u03b2+ and A05 A\u03b2+ (  CIII  ). Specifically, we applied the 1000 bootstrapped linear model equations to subject level data to determine predicted cognitive change rates for each A\u03b2+ subject of the ADNI and A05 sample. Based on the rank of the predicted cognitive change rates, we then determined a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite. Abbreviations: DV, dependent variable; IV, independent variable; CV, control variable; CR, change rate \n  \n\n\n### Assessment of cognitive changes \n  \nFor both samples, we obtained composites of MEM/LAN/EF/VS to assess cognitive-domain-specific changes. In ADNI, we used pre-established composites including ADNI-MEM [ ], ADNI-LAN, ADNI-EF, and ADNI-VS ( ) [ ]. In A05, we generated composites (i.e., A05-MEM, A05-LAN, A05-EF, A05-VS) based on available cognitive tests using a pre-established approach (see Additional file  : Methods, Table S1) [ ,  ]. For each cognitive composite and cohort, annual cognitive changes were determined by fitting linear mixed models with cognitive composites as the dependent variable and time (i.e., years from baseline) as the independent variable, with subject-specific random slope and intercept [ ,  ]. Thereby, we derived subject-specific annual cognitive change rates for each cognitive domain. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll analyses were computed using R statistical software version 4.0.2 ( ). \n\nDifferences in baseline characteristics between diagnostic groups were tested using ANOVAs for continuous and chi-squared tests for categorical data. \n\nTo compare the accuracy of different tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal, Fig.  B) for predicting cognitive decline, we performed bootstrapped linear regression with 1000 iterations per cognitive domain and tau-PET ROI. Within each iteration, cognitive changes on MEM/LAN/EF/VS were included as dependent variables, and tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal) as independent variables. For ADNI, all models were controlled for age, sex, education, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. For A05, continuous measures of education were not consistently available; hence, models were corrected for age, sex, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. In each iteration, resulting partial   R   values (variance explained in cognitive change) of the respective tau-PET ROI were extracted. The resulting partial   R   distributions of the different ROIs were then compared using paired t-tests and standardized differences were calculated using Cohen\u2019s   d  . In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CI) of bootstrapped partial   R   distributions were determined for non-parametric comparisons. Main analyses were conducted in AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) and exploratorily repeated in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus AD-spectrum sample (Fig.  C (I)). \n\nNext, we aimed to determine patient-specific cognitive composites that are informed by the baseline tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline, using ADNI as a discovery sample and A05 as a validation sample. Within ADNI A\u03b2+, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regressions controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status to extract 1000 beta-values of the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive changes (i.e., ADNI-MEM/ADNI-LAN/ADNI-EF/ADNI-VS) for each variable of the regression model (Fig.  C (II)). Note, that the cognitive composites which were used for building the model (e.g., ADNI-MEM) included slightly differed tests than the cognitive composites of the validation cohort (e.g., A05-MEM), ensuring additional generalizability of the model and independence from specific tests for MEM/LAN/EF/VS. \n\nNext, we entered patient-specific baseline data of both ADNI (i.e., discovery) and A05 (i.e., validation) subjects in the 1000 linear model equations to determine mean patient-specific estimates of cognitive decline. To generate a personalized cognitive composite, we computed squared ranks of predicted cognitive changes across MEM/LAN/EF/VS for each subject (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted decline up to 4 =fastest predicted decline), in order to maximize the information weight of cognitive domains with fast predicted cognitive decline. For each subject, cognitive changes (see the \u201cAssessment of cognitive changes\u201d section) were then weighted by the tau-PET informed squared rank (i.e., 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; see Fig.  C (III)) to determine a weighted, personalized cognitive composite that summarizes cognitive changes based on the degree of tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Using a paired   t  -test, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites show stronger cognitive changes compared to conventional cognitive composites that average all cognitive domains. \n\nLastly, we exploratorily tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites are more sensitive for detecting treatment effects compared to conventional measures of global cognition and memory. To that end, we simulated interventions by attenuating cognitive changes by 20/30/40% and calculated required sample sizes for detecting simulated intervention effects using the R-package   pwr   (settings: two-sample   t  -test, comparing actual vs. attenuated cognitive changes; two-tailed, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8; see  ). This analysis was performed for tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites, an unweighted cognitive composite (i.e.,   z  -score mean across actual change rates of ADNI/A05-MEM/LAN/EF/VS), as well as actual change rates of MEM (ADNI-MEM/A05-MEM) [ ]. The latter one was selected, since episodic memory decline is one of the hallmark cognitive symptoms in AD as extensively reported before [ \u2013 ]. The analyses were repeated in the ADNI and A05 AD spectrum groups excluding APOE4 status as a covariate to test whether our models also apply in more simple settings without APOE genotype availability (see Additional file   [ADNI:   n   = 149; A05:   n   = 67]). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample characteristics \n  \nWe included 183/53/25 CN/MCI/demented ADNI subjects (age = 74.89\u00b17.48 years) and 51/35/25 CN/MCI/demented A05 individuals (age = 71.29\u00b110.03 years). Descriptive statistics stratified by cohort, clinical status, and amyloid status are shown in Table  . Group-mean tau-PET SUVRs are shown in Additional file  : Fig. S1.   \nSubjects characteristics \n  \nIn ADNI CN: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0, non-depressed; MCI: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living; demented: MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD \n\nIn A05 CN: MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment; MCI: 24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines; demented: 10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines \n\nValues are presented as mean (SD);   p  -values were derived from ANOVAs for continuous measures and from chi-squared tests for categorical measures \n\n MEM  , episodic memory composite score;   LAN  , language composite score;   EF  , executive functioning composite score;   VS  , visuospatial composite score \n\nMean values significantly (  p   < 0.05, post-hoc tests) different from: \n\nCN A\u03b2  \u2212  \n\nCN A\u03b2+ \n\nMCI A\u03b2+ \n\nDementia A\u03b2+ \n  \n\n\n### Cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperforms conventional tau-PET metrics for predicting domain-specific cognitive decline \n  \nFirst, we determined the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future decline in MEM/LAN/EF/VS. In ADNI A\u03b2+, bootstrapped linear regression revealed cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as a better predictor of cognitive decline than global/temporal tau-PET for MEM (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.175/0.108/0.152; Fig.  A), LAN (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.201/0.164/0.136; Fig.  B), EF (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.132/0.088/0.029; Fig.  C), and VS (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.192/0.097/0.070; Fig.  D). Further, 95%CIs did not overlap between bootstrapped partial   R  -distributions of the cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and global/temporal tau-PET ROIs, providing non-parametric support that cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET explains more variance in cognitive decline than conventional tau-PET measures (Fig.  A\u2013D). Congruent results were obtained for the A05 A\u03b2+ validation cohort for all cognitive tests (Fig.  E\u2013H). Detailed results of bootstrapped regressions are provided in Additional file  : Tables S2&3. When repeating these analyses in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus A\u03b2+ sample, we obtained largely congruent results in both cohorts except for LAN in A05 (Additional file  : Table S3). Using SUVRs rather than Gaussian mixture model transformed tau-PET signal of the cognitive-domain-specific ROI yielded consistent results except for ADNI-MEM and ADNI/A05-LAN (see Additional file  : Table S4&5). The results remained consistent when excluding APOE4 status as covariate from the model (Additional file  : Table S6-10 and Figure S2). Together, these findings suggest that combining tau-PET with meta-analytical task-fMRI maps of major cognitive functions improves the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional global/temporal-lobe tau-PET measures in AD.   \nBootstrapped linear models (1000 iterations) revealed that partial   R   values (explained variance in annual cognitive changes) were higher for cognitive-domain-specific tau than for global or temporal tau-PET. The boxplots illustrate the partial   R   distributions for episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities within the AD-spectrum (ADNI cohort:   A  \u2013  D  ; A05 cohort:   E  \u2013  H  ). The models were controlled for age, sex [in ADNI: education], clinical status, baseline score of the respective cognitive test, and APOE4 status.   R  -distributions across different regions of interests (global vs. temporal vs. cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET) were compared with paired t-tests. 95% confidence intervals for the mean are displayed as horizontal lines. Within each panel, the tau-PET ROI with the highest explained variance is highlighted by an underscore. *  p   < 0.05, **  p   < 0.01, ***  p   < 0.001 \n  \n\n\n### A tau-PET-informed cognitive composite increases the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline \n  \nNext, we used tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline to determine personalized cognitive composites to better capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories. Specifically, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ (i.e., discovery sample) to determine beta-estimates for the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive decline, controlling for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status. To derive patient-specific estimates for cognitive decline in ADNI A\u03b2+, we then entered individual tau-PET measures and covariates in bootstrapped linear model equations to determine mean estimates for cognitive decline. For each subject, we then square-ranked the resulting cognitive change rates on the four cognitive domains (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted cognitive decline up to 4 =fastest predicted cognitive decline), to determine a rank-weighted cognitive composite that maximizes the information-weight of those cognitive domains in which cognitive decline is expected based on baseline tau-PET. The same linear model equations derived from ADNI A\u03b2+ were then applied to A05 A\u03b2+ for validation. In addition, we determined an \u201cunweighted\u201d cognitive composite as the average   z  -score across all four cognitive domains. We found that the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite showed faster longitudinal decline than the unweighted cognitive composite in ADNI A\u03b2+ (  T   = 20.442,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.728) but not in A05 A\u03b2+ (  T   = \u22121.423,   p   = 0.160, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.176; Fig.  ). When repeating the analysis excluding APOE4 status as covariate, we found a faster longitudinal decline of the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite in ADNI (  T   = 15.624,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.280) and in A05 (  T   = 2.758,   p   = 0.008, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.337; Additional file  : Figure S3).   \nComparison of unweighted (i.e., average of MEM/LAN/EF/VS) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites for AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) within the ADNI cohort (  A  ) and the A05 cohort (  B  ). Statistics were derived from paired   t  -tests. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n### Patient-centered cognitive composites can reduce the sample sizes to detect treatment effects in clinical trials \n  \nLastly, we exploratorily assessed whether using tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites as an endpoint in clinical trials increases the sensitivity to detect intervention effects. To this end, we compared estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects (i.e., 20/30/40% attenuated cognitive decline) for different cognitive endpoints in A\u03b2+. Specifically, we calculated estimated sample sizes for MEM (ADNI-MEM/A05-MEM), as well as unweighted (i.e., mean across ADNI/A05-MEM/LAN/VIS/EF) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites. Across both the ADNI discovery and A05 validation sample, tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites required the lowest number of participants to detect intervention effects for all intervention strengths, although effects were stronger in ADNI (Table  ). Although no significant differences were found between the unweighted and the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite in A05, our finding that the personalized cognitive composite required the lowest sample sizes also in the A05 cohort suggests that personalized cognitive composites assess cognitive change over time more sensitively than cognitive composites that are agnostic for patient-specific tau-dependent cognitive trajectories. When repeating the analysis without APOE4 as covariate, the results remained consistent, showing the lowest required sample sizes when applying the personalized cognitive composite for both cohorts (Additional file  : Table 11).   \nSample size estimation to detect simulated intervention effects of 20%, 30%, and 40% in AD-spectrum patients. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur first finding was that mapping baseline tau-PET to meta-analytical task-fMRI brain activation maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS facilitates personalized prediction of tau-related cognitive trajectories in AD. Specifically, we found tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to predict domain-specific cognitive decline better than conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global/temporal-lobe tau-PET) which have been previously shown to be prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Second, we showed that using cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as an information source to determine patient-tailored cognitive composites improves the sensitivity to assess AD-related cognitive decline compared to conventional cognitive composites. In exploratory simulated interventions, we showed further that using tau-PET-informed personalized composites as cognitive endpoints may reduce sample sizes required to detect tau-targeting treatment effects compared to conventional endpoints (e.g., MEM, global composites). Together, our independently validated findings suggest that combining tau-PET with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive abilities can facilitate the prediction of AD-related cognitive trajectories, which may improve patient-specific assessments of cognitive changes in clinical trials that target tau pathology. \n\nFirst, we reported that applying task-fMRI maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS to tau-PET in AD patients improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional prognostic tau-PET readouts [ ,  ]. We specifically focused on these cognitive domains since they are typically assessed in cognitive test protocols for evaluating AD in standard clinical settings and clinical trials [ ,  ,  ]. Our findings critically extend previous cross-sectional AD studies, emphasizing a close link between spatially heterogeneous patterns of tau deposition and neurodegeneration with heterogeneous symptom manifestation [ ,  ,  ]. Since tau pathology has been shown to disrupt neuronal connectivity in preclinical [ ] and clinical studies [ \u2013 ], neurotoxic tau may drive network dysfunction [ ] and impairment in the cognitive domain that is supported by the tau-affected network. Supporting this, we found that higher tau-PET in brain regions that support a given cognitive domain [ ,  ] is associated with faster decline in that cognitive domain. While the current study investigated tau-PET as a predictor of cognitive decline for a selected set of cognitive domains typically affected in AD [ ] our proposed methodological framework can be applied for mapping tau-PET to other cognitive or non-cognitive domains, which may motivate future efforts to investigate tau-PET for predicting patient-centered disease trajectories in AD. \n\nSecond, we show that combining baseline tau-PET with task-fMRI maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS allows determining personalized cognitive composites with increased sensitivity to detect patient-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional patient-agnostic cognitive composites. Specifically, we used baseline tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to forecast domain-specific cognitive decline. To compute a personalized composite, the actual cognitive change rates with faster tau-PET-predicted decline were weighted higher than actual change rates with slower tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Such patient-specific cognitive composites take into account inter-individual variability to facilitate longitudinal assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories [ \u2013 ] and may thus be applied as personalized endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. Supporting this, we exploratorily performed simulated trials in which tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites increased the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional composites, which have been previously used as endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. However, it should be noted that effects on estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects were smaller in A05 than in ADNI, potentially due to differences in cognitive tests used to obtain cognitive composites, differences in baseline scores, differences in the overall clinical characteristics between datasets, differences in frequency of amnestic versus non-amnestic phenotypes, APOE4 frequencies, or different data processing strategies. Despite small effect sizes, results were consistent across both samples; hence, our approach for assessing personalized composites may be a starting point for improving the assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories to reduce sample sizes in clinical trials. Nevertheless, it will be important to replicate our findings across larger studies with harmonized data assessment and clinical characteristics. \n\nA clear strength of the present study is the independent validation across two cohorts with different cognitive assessment protocols. Although sample sizes were smaller in the A05 cohort and effects less strong than in ADNI, the congruent results between both cohorts highlighted the robustness of our findings. Nevertheless, several limitations should be highlighted. First, flortaucipir shows off-target binding within hippocampal and subcortical areas [ ]. Although these regions were a priori excluded, and Gaussian-mixture modeling was performed to further eliminate off-target binding [ ,  ], our results warrant further replication with second-generation tau-PET with an improved off-target binding profile. Second, brain regions like the hippocampus are critical for cognitive function (e.g., memory); hence, second-generation tau-PET which allows hippocampal assessments [ ] may further improve the prediction of cognitive decline beyond what is currently possible with flortaucipir. Third, all analyses were determined across the entire AD spectrum. Here, it will be critical to investigate the predictive accuracy of tau-PET for cognitive decline across different clinical groups once larger datasets become available. This will be particularly important for assessing the potential of tau-PET for predicting cognitive decline in patients with early AD. Fourth, the included samples show differences in the level of clinical impairment, i.e., the A05 shows lower performance on MMSE than the ADNI sample, which may confound the tau-PET-based prediction when applying the ADNI-trained models to A05 data. Here, it will be an important next step to train and validate our models across datasets which are fully comparable across all measures. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate independently validated evidence for tau-PET combined with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive functions as a promising tool for individualized prediction of cognitive decline in AD. Tau-PET-informed cognitive composites may facilitate detecting intervention effects and thus reduce required sample sizes in clinical trials in AD, which also may be retrospectively assessed in clinical trial data with available tau-PET. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 9639286, "text_md5": "d0471b7c27b0f3593e4a1eb2c8e3bc6b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 351], "journal": [352, 371], "publication_year": [373, 377], "title": [388, 504], "keywords": [518, 588], "abstract": [601, 3832], "body": [3841, 34381]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36345046, "doi": "10.1186/s13195-022-01105-5", "pmcid": "9639286", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639286", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9639286"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639286\">9639286</a>", "list_title": "PMC9639286  Combining tau-PET and fMRI meta-analyses for patient-centered prediction of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}

M.\nSci Rep, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nResting-state abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThe gold standard for clinical assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) relies on assessing behavior via semi-structured play-based interviews and parent interviews. Although these methods show good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases, behavioral assessments alone may hinder the identification of asymptomatic at-risk group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) could be an appropriate approach to produce objective neural markers to supplement behavioral assessments due to its non-invasive and task-free nature. Previous neuroimaging studies reported inconsistent resting-state abnormalities in ASD, which may be explained by small sample sizes and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects, and/or the use of different analytical methods across studies. The current study aims to investigate the local resting-state abnormalities of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender, disease severity and methodological differences, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). MEDLINE/PubMed databases were searched for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies on ASD published until Feb 2018. Eight experiments involving 424 subjects were included in the ALE meta-analysis. We demonstrate two ASD-related resting-state findings: local underconnectivity in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and in the right medial paracentral lobule. This study contributes to uncovering a consistent pattern of resting-state local abnormalities that may serve as potential neurobiological markers for ASD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by persistent social and communication deficits, and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. A wide range of genetic and developmentally early environmental factors play an essential role in the etiological heterogeneity in ASD . In general, the worldwide population prevalence of ASD is about 1% , with a trend of increasing prevalence of ASD across different countries . Longitudinal studies indicate that only 20% of individuals with ASD seem to obtain a good adult outcome as indicated by the quality of independent living, friendships and participation in employment . The high prevalence and poor prognosis of ASD result in an enormous cost for society and for the individual, in loss of productive years and cost of educational support . Early intervention is needed to decelerate, or even prevent, the developmental cascade that manifests in the disorder. To do so, an accurate and early diagnosis of ASD is essential. \n\nTo date, the gold standard for clinical assessment of ASD includes administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2)  and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)  that assess behavior by semi-structured play-based interviews and parent interviews, respectively. Although the combination of ADOS and ADI-R has been found to have good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases as young as 12 months old, the predictive validity of the measure can be markedly reduced if the examiner who carries out the test is not the primary diagnostician . Furthermore, this kind of behavioral assessments require well-trained examiner to carry out, yet training can be time-consuming, expensive and difficult to procure . More importantly, children comorbid with ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is not uncommon, could delay ASD diagnosis due to some shared symptoms between ASD and ADHD in 2\u20133 year old. In a large population-based study, the presence of ADHD and/or sensory processing symptoms in children with ASD delayed an autism diagnosis for around 3 years . These add to the difficulty of admitting clinical cases into the right intervention program before school age, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of behavioral therapies because the most sensitive window for neural and behavioral changes has been missed . In addition, many infants who were eventually diagnosed with ASD remained asymptomatic at 6\u20139 months old . It is difficult to use behavioral measures alone to identify at-risk group at an early life stage during which crucial developmental delays may be manifesting. The development of objective biomarkers is, therefore, essential for supplementing traditional behavioral measures for better diagnosis of ASD. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no objective biomarkers exist for diagnosing ASD. \n\nIn the past decades, researchers attempted to find out reliable biomarkers to predict ASD by understanding its etiology and pathology. For instance, de novo missense, promoter, and enhancer mutations were found in autism probands compared to the unaffected siblings in 516 idiopathic autism families. Furthermore, in the same studied cohort, oligogenic de novo mutations were enriched for expression in striatal neurons in autism probands , suggesting a complex genomic pattern in ASD. In addition, epigenetic changes through DNA methylation and trans-sulfuration were also noted in ASD cases, indicating interaction effects between environmental and genetic factors on ASD . On the other hand, there is evidence supporting the presence of proteomic biomarkers in predicting ASD such as increased glycation endproducts . Another line of research suggests that autism could be associated with the diversity of intestinal microflora. For instance, the presence of autistic symptoms was found to be associated with less diverse gut microbiomes in 20 autistic children . Functional studies are required to confirm the role of those mutated genes in ASD using animal models. More future studies in human subjects are also warranted to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these potential biomarkers in predicting ASD. \n\nThere is a growing number of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach to study the neural underpinnings of behaviors associated with ASD. In the past decades, a large number of task-based fMRI studies were conducted, and meta-analyses on these task-based fMRI studies were also available. For instance, Philip and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on task-based fMRI studies of ASD including motor, visual processing, executive function, auditory and language, basic social processing and complex social cognition tasks . They concluded that the most reliable finding was a disturbance to the function of social brain regions, whereas comparisons on other tasks were difficult due to the diversity and complexity of tasks used across studies. Such limitations together with the fact that task difficulty may preclude some children, especially infants, from participation, make task-based fMRI features not to be ideal as biomarkers for ASD . \n\nResting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising alternative to the study of large-scale organization of the typically and atypically developing brain in infants and toddlers . rs-fMRI data can be acquired in 5\u20136\u2009minutes as the participants lay in the MRI scanner with either eyes closed or fixated on a cross-hair. It helps reveal the coupling of functional brain networks independent of task performance. These advantages make it particularly suitable for examining brain maturation in pediatric and clinical populations such as ASD participants who often have a wide range of functioning levels. Numerous studies have attempted to work out local resting-state differences between subjects with ASD and typically developing (TD) age-matched controls. However, the findings have been inconsistent. For example, during resting state, Maximo and colleagues  observed local overconnectivity in posterior temporal regions, whereas Paakki and colleagues  found reduced local synchronization in superior temporal region, in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. Also, some studies observed local overconnectivity in the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes in subjects with ASD  but some other studies did not detect any local overconnectivity in subjects with ASD . Small sample sizes, phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects and/or the use of different analytical methods across studies may have contributed to the inconsistencies. Although the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative could provide a large dataset to avoid false-negative errors, many studies that utilized ABIDE dataset adopted a cluster-wise inference approach in their statistical analyses. It has recently been suggested that the use of cluster-wise inference in parametric statistical methods may lead to inflated false-positive rates, especially when a lenient cluster-defining threshold (CDT) such as uncorrected p\u2009=\u20090.01 was used . A systematic and quantitative meta-analysis is, therefore, timely to unearth consistent local resting-state abnormalities that are truly unique to ASD regardless of all methodological differences. However, a meta-analysis of the resting-state abnormalities in subjects with ASD has yet to be performed. \n\nThe current study aims to investigate the neural abnormalities in local resting-state connectivity of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender and disease severity, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Any consistent pattern that could be identified from a diverse sampling should represent the core resting-state abnormalities that are sensitive to ASD. Findings from this ALE meta-analysis study could provide insight into the development of neural biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD in future studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwo-hundred and four ASD subjects (175 males) with mean age of 20.30\u2009\u00b1\u200910.20 and 220 TD subjects (185 males) with mean age of 19.87\u2009\u00b1\u20099.72 were included.

According to the Vogt\u2019s model , the PCC consists of the dorsal and ventral parts, which are superior and posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum, respectively. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , our dorsal PCC cluster is situated superior to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Based on the ALE output, the right medial paracentral lobule cluster was contributed by foci from three studies , and the dorsal PCC cluster was contributed by foci from two studies .   \n(  A  ) Reduced resting-state local connectivity in subjects with ASD compared to typically developing participants, including the right medial paracentral lobule and the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) cluster.

R\u2009=\u2009Right. \n  \n\nFor the ASD\u2009>\u2009TD comparison, no significant clusters were found. For both comparisons, all results were basically the same no matter which set of Nair   et al  .\u2019s results  was included in the ALE analyses. The corresponding anatomical locations and peak ALE maxima are shown in Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 .   \nResting-state abnormalities in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. \n  \nAbbreviations: ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder; BA, Brodmann Area; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; TD, Typically Developing Control. \n  \n\nTo further examine the functional role of the right medial paracentral lobule and dorsal PCC, behavioral profiling was performed using the Behavioral Analysis plugin (v2.2) via the Mango software ( ). The behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, which has five major domains (Action, Cognition, Emotion, Interoception, and Perception) and fifty-one sub-domains of mental operations , was queried to characterize the behavioral domain specificity of the two resultant brain regions. Z-scores were calculated for all fifty-one sub-domains, and a Z-score\u2009>\u20093.0 is regarded as statistically significant. According to the behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, the dorsal PCC cluster was found to be engaged in a sub-domain of Emotion called \u2018other\u2019 (Z-score\u2009=\u20093.411) (Fig.\u00a0 ), which is defined as \u2018  any affective processes that qualify as Emotion  ,   but do not fit into any of the other Emotion sub-domains  \u2019. Alternatively, the right medial paracentral lobule was not found to be engaged in any of the domains/sub-domains (all Z-scores\u2009<\u20093.0). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this ALE study, we observed consistently lower resting-state local connectivity in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls across eight different studies that included subjects with mixed characteristics. No ASD-related local overconnectivity was found. These results remain the same no matter which set of result from Nair   et al  .\u2019s study  was included in the ALE analyses. This indicates the stability of our results regardless of the GSR and/or standardization step performed in one of the contributing studies. These support our aim of identifying a consistent neural pattern underlying ASD regardless of subject variations and methodological differences. \n\nCluster-level FWE correction method was applied in this ALE meta-analysis. Although cluster-wise inference may have a higher chance of inflating false-positive rates (especially when a lenient CDT was used, e.g. p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to voxel-wise inference in individual studies , voxel-wise inference remains rather conservative for both individual studies and ALE . For the sake of both sensitivity and specificity, the cluster-level FWE correction method is still regarded as the most appropriate method for statistical inference in ALE . Therefore, we used cluster-level FWE correction method with a relatively more stringent CDT (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for a better control on the false-positive rates in our current ALE study. Under such setting, we did not find any consistent ASD-related resting-state local overconnectivity. This corroborates the recent conclusion that the hypothesis of \u2018general local overconnectivity\u2019 in ASD is likely to be unproven . Such a conclusion was drawn mainly based on ReHo results, a technique which often attracts criticism on producing inconsistent regional findings due to the choices of motion correction, smoothness, GSR, and standardization . We added to this conclusion by showing that the use of ICA, fALFF or ASL, in addition to ReHo, also did not produce any consistent overconnectivity patterns for ASD. Although studies using ABIDE database tend to report various local overconnectivity effects in the frontal and temporal cortices that seemingly replicate each other, for instance, in the superior temporal cortex , and the dorsal superior frontal cortex or supplementary motor cortex , such observations could plausibly be due to the inclusion of highly similar dataset from the same ABIDE pool. Alternatively, our meta-analysis study, which included some original datasets that have not been shared to the ABIDE pool at the time of our study, showed a different outcome. Although four of the included studies reported ASD-related local overconnectivity effects, no consistent effects could be obtained in our ALE analyses. Notably, the other four included studies also failed to detect any local overconnectivity effects. Our findings suggest that the mixed patterns of overconnectivity effects seen in some previous studies are more likely to be artifacts that differ substantially across studies and cannot be meaningfully unified in meta-analyses. \n\nUnder the same methodological considerations, two consistent ASD-related local underconnectivity effects were revealed in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule. This suggests that the local underconnectivity effects are true effects that survive through the controversial preprocessing steps of analyzing resting-state data and the inclusion of ASD subjects with mixed characteristics. Being the first hub that exhibits the strongest connections of the default mode network in the developmental trajectory , the PCC is involved in many important processes such as regulation and balancing the focus of attention to internal or external thoughts , arousal and awareness , and self-referential thought . More specifically, it has recently been suggested that the ventral PCC may be responsible for internally directed cognition associated with the DMN such as planning for the future and memory retrieval, whereas the dorsal PCC may play a direct role in controlling our attentional focus by adjusting the stability of brain network over time (\u2018whole-brain metastability\u2019) . According to Leech and Sharp , a high activity in the dorsal PCC supported increased whole-brain metastability for rapid transition between different cognitive processes in a broad attentional state. In contrast, a low activity in the dorsal PCC was related to a decrease in metastability, which allowed stable cognitive processing for a specific task in a narrow attentional state . During resting state, a high dorsal PCC activity allows a broad attentional focus for the continuous flow of unconstrainted thoughts in our mind (\u2018freewheeling\u2019). This state is associated with rapid transitions between neural states, and rapid changes of activity in intrinsic connectivity networks. Our results of local underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC suggest that a narrow attentional state may exist during resting state in subjects with ASD. According to the metastability model , a narrow attentional state does not favor rapid transition between different cognitive processes. This corroborates with one of the hallmark features of ASD, that is, cognitive inflexibility . Clinically, the level of cognitive inflexibility is measured by symptom severity of repetitive behaviors , which was found to be negatively associated with the level of discriminability between task-evoked and resting brain states in children with ASD . In other words, a weak modulation of brain states may underlie cognitive inflexibility in ASD . This is in line with our finding of ASD-related resting-state underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC, which favors narrow attentional state during resting and does not support switching between brain states. Future studies should further explore whether the resting-state local connectivity of the dorsal PCC is correlated with the behavioral symptom of cognitive inflexibility in ASD, which may help explain the \u2018need for sameness\u2019 and an inability to flexibly adapt behavior in ASD. \n\nAccording to behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, the dorsal PCC cluster was found to be engaged in a sub-domain of Emotion called \u2018other\u2019, which does not fall into any of the other Emotion sub-domains (e.g. intensity of emotion, valence of emotion, positive emotion such as happiness and negative emotion such as fear, anxiety and sadness) . In other words, its activity cannot be solely attributed to the evaluations of the strength or aversiveness of an emotional stimulus, nor the two opposite ends of emotion. In fact, the \u2018Emotion: other\u2019 sub-domain is represented by several large clusters of activation spanning through the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) to anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, as well as subcortical regions such as the insula, amygdalae, thalamus and caudate (see  ). These brain regions overlap with several components of the so-called \u2018social brain\u2019, for instance, the medial PFC, PCC and amygdala, which are important for affective aspects of social processing . As the PCC is implicated in both the DMN and theory of mind network, it is believed that the PCC is crucial for supporting a common-sense understanding of social behavior to facilitate social interaction . Notably, impaired social functioning and deficits in emotional understanding are persistent features of ASD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)  and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) . A recent study showed that the delayed development in emotional understanding in ASD was associated with severity of social problems . Therefore, it is possible that our findings in the dorsal PCC may also be related to a weakened ability on interpreting social signals, especially those requiring affective processing, in people with ASD. \n\nWe also observed a lower resting-state local connectivity in the right medial paracentral lobule in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. This abnormality was seen across adolescent  and middle-aged samples with ASD , suggesting that this abnormality could be persistent in ASD. The paracentral lobule is a continuation of the precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe and the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe towards the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The observed medial paracentral cluster in this study belongs to the portion continued from the postcentral gyrus (i.e. the somatosensory cortex) as it locates posterior to the central sulcus . This posterior portion plays a role in somatosensory processing of the lower limbs , and the parietal lobe is involved in integrating sensory and somatosensory information from different body parts . Our findings in the medial paracentral lobule may, therefore, be related to the impairment of multisensory integration which is commonly seen in ASD . On the other hand, it is believed that the paracentral lobule works with the precuneus to generate the representation of the body in the spatial world, which is important for producing a sense of self . An intact representation of the physical self appears to be important to the development of an abstract self . Impairment to the paracentral lobule and its functional connections with other regions may therefore disrupt the representation of oneself in the world that further affects the development of theory of mind in ASD . Future studies are warranted to confirm our speculations. \n\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, the sample size was relatively small in this meta-analysis, which may lead to a higher chance of committing Type I and Type II errors. When cluster level FWE correction method is applied, seventeen experiments were recommended to be included in an ALE meta-analysis to avoid results that are largely driven by one experiment . For analyses involving less than ten experiments, the likelihood that results are largely driven by a singly experiment increases, especially if the experiment has a relatively larger sample size than the remaining studies . In the current study, the findings of underconnectivity in the right medial paracentral lobule cluster and the dorsal PCC cluster were contributed by three studies  and two studies , respectively. None of these contributing studies had a substantially larger sample size than the remaining ones, suggesting the chance of having a dominant effect from a singly study is low. To further confirm the finding in the PCC, we did a narrative review from three excluded studies that examined only the DMN resting-state abnormalities in ASD. In line with our findings, two studies demonstrated hypoconnectivities in the PCC in adults (PCC coordinates in Talairach space: x\u2009=\u2009\u22125, y\u2009=\u2009\u221249, z\u2009=\u200940)  and teenagers (PCC coordinates in Talairach space: x\u2009=\u2009\u22123, y\u2009=\u2009\u221240, z\u2009=\u200913)  with ASD. The other study reported reduced resting-state functional connectivity in DMN regions including the PCC (coordinates were not provided) in children (1\u20138 years old) with ASD compared with TD controls , indicating that the abnormalities that we found might also be observed in children with ASD. To confirm our findings and explore other neural abnormalities in ASD with a greater power, another comprehensive meta-analysis of the same topic with a larger sample (e.g. twenty experiments ) shall be conducted in future when more relevant studies are available. Last, although follow-up behavioral analyses were performed for the right medial paracentral lobule cluster and the dorsal PCC cluster, the association between neural markers and behavioral symptoms in ASD cannot be deduced using this ALE method. Despite the limitations, our findings demonstrated two ASD-related resting-state local underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule, which are consistent across studies with mixed subject characteristics and methodology. Findings from behavioral analyses support the role of the dorsal PCC in weakened ability on interpreting social affective signals, and we speculate that it might also link to cognitive inflexibility. The right medial paracentral finding may be associated with the altered representation of the physical self in ASD, which seems to be common across ASD subjects of different ages. Overall, this study contributes to uncovering a consistent pattern of resting-state local abnormalities in ASD, which may serve as potential neurobiological markers for ASD. Future studies should examine the specificity and sensitivity of detecting these abnormalities for early identification of people who are vulnerable to ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA comprehensive online literature search on the MEDLINE/PubMed databases was conducted, focusing on functional neuroimaging studies on ASD. Keyword searches were conducted using the following search terms: (1) \u201cneuroimaging\u201d <OR >\u201cfMRI,\u201d (2) \u201cresting state\u201d <OR >\u201cdefault network\u201d and (3) \u201cautism spectrum disorder\u201d <OR >\u201cASD\u201d <OR >\u201cautism\u201d. These searches were confined to articles published in English up to February 2018, which yielded 278 original or review articles. We also searched through the reference list of relevant review articles for additional studies. From these research articles, we included studies that reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates of whole-brain contrast comparing ASD subjects and TD healthy controls. Two of the authors (WKWL and MKL) confirmed the inclusions of the identified studies. Studies were excluded if (1) no control group was included; (2) they were review articles; (3) only   a priori   region of interest (ROI) analysis, seed-based functional connectivity analysis or graph theory analysis was conducted; (4) independent component analysis (ICA) was performed and only the default mode network (DMN) component or another specific component was examined; (5) only task-based fMRI experiment was reported; or (6) only online fMRI datasets such as ABIDE, were used. According to the recommendation from the BrainMap team (see  ), studies that intentionally restrict their analyses to a ROI (e.g. the DMN component) that is substantially smaller than the whole brain should be excluded. Otherwise, the ALE algorithm may be biased to report the foci from the ROI studies as significant, because it assumes that each effect in the brain is approximately equally likely to occur, resulting in an increase in false positive rate. The exclusion of online dataset is to ensure that our ALE analyses will not be falsefully biased by including similar results generated from the same data source. Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, which included eight fMRI studies and 1 arterial spin labeling (ASL) study. Among the eight fMRI studies, three of them used regional homogeneity (ReHo) , one of them used fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) , and four of them used ICA . One of the studies did not find any spatial group difference , therefore, it was not included in the ALE meta-analysis. Eight studies (eight experiments) involving 424 subjects were finally included in the ALE meta-analysis (Table\u00a0 ). All of them reported reduced resting-state local connectivity in ASD compared to TD controls (eight experiments, 28 foci). Four of them found increased resting-state local connectivity in ASD compared to TD controls (4 experiments, 18 foci) (Table\u00a0 ). \n\nThe coordinate-based ALE analysis was conducted by GingerALE version 2.3.6 (The BrainMap Database,  ; San Antonio, TX, USA). Coordinates in MNI space were imported into the software. Imported foci were modeled as three-dimensional Gaussian spatial probability distributions using a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel estimated based on the corresponding experiment\u2019s sample size . The \u2018non-additive\u2019 method was used to combine these probability distributions and generate a modeled activation map . The union of the modeled activation maps of each experiment was then created to form the ALE image. The ALE image contains the combined probability distribution of finding an activation being located at that particular voxel, which is the ALE score. To better control for the false-positive rates, the ALE image was then thresholded using uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster-level inference threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 with 5000 permutations of simulated random data based on the characteristics of the imported data . \n\nGroup differences in resting-state local connectivity among the ASD and TD participants were examined using the results of between-group contrasts (ASD\u2009<\u2009TD and ASD\u2009>\u2009TD) from individual studies. Since the study conducted by Nair and colleagues  reported three sets of results using different analysis procedures (standardized ReHo with the use of global signal regression, GSR; standardized ReHo without using GSR; nonstandardized ReHo without using GSR; see Table\u00a0 ), three separate ALE analyses were performed for each of the between-group contrast by including one of the three sets of their results each time. As to the study conducted by Maximo and colleagues , according to the authors, the results of applying GSR and not applying GSR, and the results of applying standardization and not applying standardization, were highly similar. Therefore, we did not separately test for the different sets of results of their study. As a result, a total of six ALE analyses were performed. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6405852, "text_md5": "3bbbc8b2b1261a5f2cdee6405b958946", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 55], "journal": [56, 63], "publication_year": [65, 69], "title": [80, 153], "keywords": [167, 167], "abstract": [180, 1715], "body": [1724, 31157]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30846796, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-40427-7", "pmcid": "6405852", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6405852", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6405852"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6405852\">6405852</a>", "list_title": "PMC6405852  Resting-state abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A meta-analysis"}

In contrast, experimental hyperalgesia induced stronger activation in the bilateral insula, left cingulate and right frontal gyrus. \n\nActivation likelihood maps support a shared neural pain signature of cutaneous nociception in CP and controls. We also present a double dissociation between neural correlates of transient and persistent pain sensitisation with general increased activation intensity but unchanged pattern in experimental hyperalgesia and, by contrast, focally increased activation likelihood, but unchanged intensity, in CP when stimulated at the most painful body part. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChronic pain is a common public health concern. According to a report by  , pain accounts for 40% of primary care consultations. A survey of adult Europeans found that the prevalence of moderate or severe chronic pain was 19% ( ), of whom 21% were diagnosed with depression related to their pain and 65% reported sleep disturbance due to pain ( ). Severe chronic pain was also found to be associated with increased 10 year mortality ( ). In the absence of more effective pain treatment personal suffering and socio-economic burden are huge, with the total annual cost of pain in the US estimated to be between $560 and $635 billion ( ). This highlights the need for better understanding of the neural mechanisms underpinning the processing of chronic pain in order to begin addressing this issue. \n\nPresently there is no clear temporal definition of when persistent pain is considered to be \u2fffchronic\u2fff. However, there is consensus that chronic pain refers to pain persisting beyond its ecological alerting function, (i.e. when no benefit from healing can be assumed). As such chronic pain is considered a maladaptive state that is characterised not only by pain severity but also by a range of associated comorbidities including depression, distress and anxiety. A detailed taxonomy based upon symptom description and underlying etiology has been developed and recently updated by the International Association for the Study of Pain ( ). Several etiological factors are coded, and in general nociceptive pain is distinguished from neuropathic pain:   nociceptive pain   involves activation of nociceptors through actual or threatened non-neural tissue damage, whereas   neuropathic pain   is defined as \u2fffpain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system\u2fff ( ). \n\nThe pathophysiology of chronic pain states is not well understood but there is a body of neurobiological and neuroimaging evidence suggesting that neuroplasticity is associated with the development of persisting pain ( ,  ,  ,  ). In animal models, several mechanisms of pain sensitisation were identified and characterised with peripheral sensitisation via activation of C-fibers, sodium channel alteration after nerve injury and central cord sensitisation due to increased spinal transmitter release and hyperexcitability of dorsal horn neurons ( ). Modulation of stimulus-induced pain perception at the supraspinal level is highly complex with close interconnection of sensory, emotional and cognitive appraisal networks. Moreover, a key serotonergic descending facilitation pathway originates from the rostral brainstem and is believed to mediate fear and anxiety-related pain augmentation ( ). Increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) is well known in chronic pain patients (CP) resulting from a combination of peripheral and central sensitisation at the spinal cord level and supraspinal pain augmentation/facilitation ( ). \n\nCentral sensitization can be modelled in healthy human controls through priming, e.g. with intradermal capsaicin (active ingredient in chili, a TRPV1 receptor agonist), which leads to cross-modality hyperalgesia and allodynia (pain from non-noxious stimuli). The underlying neurophysiology is well characterised, and thought to reflect transient heterosynaptic changes making experimental central sensitisation a sound mechanistic model to test efficacy of centrally acting analgesics ( ). By contrast, top-down facilitatory processes are less well understood and robust experimental human models are lacking. Nevertheless, depression and low mood are commonly associated with chronic pain, and are thought to contribute to central pain augmentation and severity. Several studies have found that induction of depressed mood or sadness in healthy subjects increases pain sensitivity and augments pain unpleasantness ( ,  ,  ). \n\nModern functional neuroimaging has proved instrumental in gaining a deeper understanding of pain processing and its main modulatory factors in healthy volunteers ( ,  ) and chronic pain conditions. In line with the multidimensional nature of pain perception, experimental pain induces activation in several cortical and subcortical regions including primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices, insula (INS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, brainstem and prefrontal and parietal association areas ( ). These structures, often referred to as the \u2fffpain matrix\u2fff ( ), do not constitute a network that is unique to pain; in fact there are striking similarities with activation patterns of innocuous sensory stimuli ( ). Consistent, but not pain specific, co-activation may relate to any of the aspects of the pain experience including saliency of stimuli ( ), emotional responses ( ) or action preparation ( ), all of which could be modulated by chronic pain ( ). Functional neuroimaging might therefore be ideally suited to studying the functional reorganisation of both nociceptive and pain modulatory pathways in chronic pain syndromes, and to relate putative plasticity changes to etiologic pain subtypes and underlying mechanisms such as central sensitisation and negative affect. \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown altered neural response to pain in CP compared to healthy controls (HC), for example ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, there is some inconsistency between studies. Systematic reviews offer one method of exploring which of the reported altered neural responses are consistently observed, for example more frequent prefrontal, and less frequent ACC, S1, S2 and INS activation was noted in CP ( ,  ). Recently coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) has become a popular alternative. CBMA analyses the results from related studies and performs statistical inference on them. Probably the most commonly used method computes an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) using the reported coordinates to identify and locate brain structures that are activated consistently across studies or differently between conditions/groups. In this way CBMA can mitigate low power and bias present in individual fMRI studies ( ,  ). Several CBMAs of pain have been performed ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). While some focused on general and modality-specific pain-induced changes in brain activity ( ,  ,  ) others have studied the role of specific structures ( ) or context-dependent effects ( ,  ). CBMA has also been used to compare abnormal and altered pain states in CP or experimental hyperalgesia ( ,  ). Allodynia/hyperalgesia in chronic neuropathic and fibromyalgia patients was associated with increased activation likelihood in the left S2, ACC and right caudal anterior insula compared to experimental pain in HC ( ) while neuropathic pain decreased activation likelihood in most pain processing areas including S1, anterior and posterior insula and ACC compared to experimental hyperalgesia in HC ( ). There are, however, several methodological limitations of previous CBMA studies of pain. We have previously shown that the ALE methods are prone to false positive results ( ,  ), and a new version of the software implementation (GingerALE, version 2.3.3) has been released to fix this. We have also shown that the false positive rate can increase with increasing study numbers ( ); the current ALE algorithm does not correct for this. Furthermore, group comparisons make assumptions about the ALE that do not strictly hold ( ,  ), or lack appropriate correction for the many statistical tests performed ( ). A further limitation is the uncontrolled heterogeneity between studies, often mixing functional neuroimaging methods (known to vary in sensitivity) or mixing a range of nociceptive receptor systems (superficial, deep and visceral). \n\nTo better understand the commonalities of altered pain processing in CP and any specific modulation related to its subtypes, and importantly to compare activation patterns in CP with experimental models of putative underlying mechanisms of pain sensitisation (hyperalgesia and low mood) in healthy controls, we undertook a CBMA on superficial pain fMRI studies and systematically addressed key experimental factors. We hypothesised that the neural response to experimental pain differs between CP and HC reflecting functional reorganisation, and that such changes can be partially modelled by experimental hyperalgesia or low mood in healthy controls. To overcome some of the limitations of previous pain CBMAs we employ a recently developed modified ALE based algorithm that reduces false positive results by using an intuitive type 1 error control scheme: the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR; similar to false discovery rate, but for clusters) control ( ). We employ the same control for the contrast meta-analysis (CMA) used to locate differences in functional activation foci due to pain stimulus between groups ( ). However, this test is sensitive only to strong local differences, so we also use an omnibus test that can detect subtle but distributed differences in the pattern when CMA is unrevealing ( ). This test has also been used to explore differences due to experimental factors, such as pain stimulus modality (thermal, mechanical and electrical) to assess heterogeneity introduced by such factors. This, plus careful, and conservative study selection was used to create, as far as possible, homogeneous experimental groups. To this end, we limit the CBMA to fMRI studies and to cutaneous noxious stimuli thus eliminating unwanted heterogeneity from different imaging modalities and different nociceptive systems (superficial vs. deep and visceral). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study inclusion and data selection \n  \nThe literature search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting meta-analyses and systematic reviews ( ). Functional MRI studies of experimental cutaneous pain were searched both through standard literature databases (PubMed and Web of Knowledge) and from existing fMRI data repository NeuroSynth (neurosynth.org). NeuroSynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of fMRI data extracted from published articles ( ). We used the keywords (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff or \u2ffflow mood\u2fff or \u2fffemotion\u2fff). In order to capture as many papers as possible, including studies on CP, additional searches have been performed using the strings (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff)AND (\u2ffflow mood\u2fff or \u2fffemotion\u2fff), and (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpatients\u2fff or \u2fffneuropathic\u2fff or \u2fffchronic pain\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff). For the search on NeuroSynth repository we used the key word \u2fffpain\u2fff. Last accession of e-sources: 15 February 2015. The references of retrieved articles were then assessed for additional studies that could be considered for inclusion; along with the relevant references from review articles and meta-analyses. Abstracts were reviewed to select those studies involving noxious pain stimuli that had been induced via cutaneous stimulation. Studies reporting only activations for spontaneous pain in patients were excluded. Only studies that reported whole-brain group analysis as coordinates in the standard Talairach & Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space were considered ( ,  ). Studies on HC with or without pain sensitisation were included. In cases where experimental pain was induced in addition to a cognitive manipulation task we only included the baseline coordinates of pain induction; if baseline coordinates were not given; the study was excluded from further analysis. \n\n\n### Data extraction and pre-processing \n  \nActivation coordinates were extracted from the papers manually and checked by three independent persons. Data extracted from each article were the authors\u2fff names, date of publication, study population, sample size, stimulus modality, anatomical site of stimulation, laterality of bodily stimulation, brain activation coordinates and their associated standardised space (Talairach or MNI). Differences in the standardised coordinate space were addressed by converting all reported coordinates into Talairach space ( ). We only included coordinates of activations since deactivations were reported by few studies, and the majority of studies did not comment on the presence or absence of deactivations. \n\nImportantly, we also extracted activation coordinates from studies of between group comparisons allowing us to perform coordinate based meta-analysis of contrasts (MAC). Since such data is generated under controlled experimental conditions, MAC provides a powerful way to explore spatially consistent differences in activation intensity between the groups. This analysis is complementary to the contrast meta-analysis, which explores differences in consistency of reported structures, performed on similar groups. \n\nMultiple studies reported in single papers can be strongly correlated. This would result in bias if these studies were considered independent ( ). To prevent this, the extracted coordinates were merged into a single study if the paper reported results differing only by experimental factors such as different stimulus intensities, different body site stimulated, or data split by analysis e.g. late/early BOLD response. Studies using different subjects were not merged. \n\nDifferent studies reporting the same results also violate the assumption of independence. Instances of repeated coordinates were identified and removed to prevent bias. \n\n\n### Coordinate based meta-analysis \n  \nHere we use a recently developed algorithm (LocalALE), which is freely available from  . This algorithm utilizes the coordinates from fMRI studies to estimate where there is consistently reported activation across studies. It is based on the commonly used ALE algorithm ( ) that utilizes a Gaussian, with specified full width half max (FWHM), model for each coordinate to estimate the activation likelihood. When many studies report coordinates in a similar location, the activation likelihood is high; a threshold for statistical significance is determined by a permutation test. LocalALE has important advantages over the more commonly used ALE algorithm: (1) the false positive rate is reduced, and (2) by adjusting the FWHM, heterogeneity between experiments that have different numbers of studies is reduced ( ,  ). Anatomical placement of significant clusters was reported in Talairach space using an automatic labelling scheme incorporated within LocalALE ( ). \n\n\n### Contrast meta-analysis \n  \nContrast meta-analysis is used to compare the reported activation foci between two groups, and has been described previously ( ). The results are clusters of coordinates where the activation pattern differs significantly between the groups. The null hypothesis is that the two groups report the same activation pattern. Permutation of the group variable is performed to estimate a   p  -value for each coordinate. This differs from the previously published scheme, where a   p  -value was estimated for each voxel; our scheme reduces the number of statistical tests performed by several orders of magnitude, and employs FCDR, to control type 1 errors ( ). \n\n\n### An omnibus test of differences between two activation patterns \n  \nContrast meta-analysis is sensitive to localised spatial differences in activation pattern between two groups. These differences need to be highly significant to survive correction for the multiple statistical tests performed. Consequently CMA is not sensitive to more subtle diffuse differences between the groups. Therefore, we have devised an omnibus test of difference in activation pattern between two groups ( ). \n\nThe algorithm tests the combined   p  -values (sum, over coordinates, of the log   p  -values) generated by CMA using a method analogous to Fisher\u2fffs combined probability test; but without the assumption of independent, uniformly distributed,   p  -values. It achieves this by comparison with a null distribution generated from similarly combined   p  -values obtained by performing CMA on 1000 random permutations of the grouping variable. This test differs from CMA in that it requires not that single   p  -values be very small, but that the combined   p  -values be critical of the null hypothesis; this can occur when there is a diffuse pattern of subtle differences resulting in multiple small   p  -values, or a focal highly significant difference affecting just a few   p  -values. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \n#### Study and data quality control \n  \nThere is no consensus on minimum quality standards for, or how to quantify the quality of, functional MRI studies. Many fMRI studies are thought to be underpowered but there is no suitable formula based e.g. on number of subjects to determine a clear cut-off as the effect size for the chosen brain activation contrast will depend on the chosen activation and control task, respective presentation length and number of repeats in addition to technical factors such as field strength, sensitivity of head coil, acquisition protocol details and scanner-specific stability. Studies were thus considered eligible for inclusion when describing commonly used fMRI acquisition and analysis protocols. \n\nImportantly, we used the diagnostic procedure detailed in ( ) to check that studies appear commensurate in their respective groups. How commensurate each study is with all others was quantified by computing the mean activation likelihood across coordinates within the study, then comparing these to the distribution of mean activation likelihood values generated using an equal number of random coordinates; if the observed mean was in the high tail of this distribution, the study was considered commensurate. This test is sensitive to coordinate extraction errors and was used to pinpoint outlying studies to be scrutinised further and corrected as necessary. Further analysis was performed only after checking that the data are correct, and that the studies were included in the appropriate experimental group. \n\n\n#### Statistics \n  \nThe CBMA, and MAC, were performed using an FCDR of 0.05, so of the significant clusters identified at most 5% would be expected under the null hypothesis. Contrast meta-analysis is less sensitive and performed using an FCDR of 0.1. For primary analyses (HC vs. CP) trends towards significance are also noted. The omnibus test of differences was considered significant if   p  \u00a0\u2fe4\u00a00.05. \n\n\n#### Comparing activation pattern between groups \n  \nComparisons of study groups were performed using three types of analysis. Plotting the frequency with which the studies report activations in each Talairach structure visually highlights where the groups differ, and where they are similar; structures were determined as the nearest grey matter Talairach structure to each reported coordinate. Comparison of groups by CMA revealed clusters of coordinates in locations where the activation patterns differ statistically. If this was unrevealing, the omnibus test of differences was used to more sensitively detect any differences, but without revealing where those differences are. \n\n\n\n### Experimental factors affecting the neural pain response pattern \n  \nTo maximise statistical power experimental groups were created to contain as many studies as possible. This involved merging subgroups differing by experimental factors that might affect the functional response. Such differences would be a source of heterogeneity. The omnibus test was used here to explore such sources of heterogeneity. \n\nIt has been suggested that the encoding of painful stimuli takes place primarily in the contralateral hemisphere to the stimulation site ( ). Mirroring the coordinates from left-sided body stimulation about the y-axis (multiplying the x coordinate by \u2fff1) would then maintain homogeneity across all studies, as long as the hemispheric lateralization is of minor importance in pain processing. Such mirroring has been used in a previous CBMA of pain ( ), but has recently been challenged ( ). We compared subgroups of HC, where the grouping was right sided stimulation (subgroup RIGHT ,  ) and left sided stimulation (subgroup LEFT ,  ). The analysis was performed twice, once with original coordinates, and once with the coordinates mirrored in the left sided stimulus group. The results were used to determine whether mirroring of coordinates was performed throughout all subsequent experiments.   \nStudy groups included in the CBMA (in grey: main groups; in white: sub-groups). \n  Table 1   \n\nSubgroups of HC studies by modality (electrical, mechanical, and thermal) were formed (subgroups MECH , THERM , ELEC ;  ). HC studies were also grouped by baseline stimulus: \u2fffpain versus (vs.) innocuous stimuli\u2fff and \u2fffpain vs. rest\u2fff (subgroups INNOC  and REST ;  ), and by \u2fffcued\u2fff and \u2fffnon-cued\u2fff stimulation (subgroups CUED  and NCUED ;  ). Relevant subgroups were compared. \n\nPain sensitisation in CP may be affected by site and type (noxious or allodynic) of stimulus. In the CP group, half of the studies applied a stimulus at the most painful clinical site (CS) of the chronic pain (CS  subgroup;  ), while half used other bodily sites (OS) stimulation (OS  subgroup;  ); because all fibromyalgia (FM) studies included nociceptive stimulation remotely from any area reported by participants as being chronically painful (finger/thumb stimulation\u2fff6 studies; hand stimulation\u2fff2 studies), we included the eight FM studies in the OS  subgroup. To assess the influence of FM studies on the results, comparison between CS and OS was also performed excluding FM from the OS group (using the omnibus test). Around one quarter of the CP studies used non-noxious stimuli at the allodynic site (ALDN  subgroup;  ) whilst the rest used noxious painful stimuli (NOX  subgroup;  ). These groups were compared by omnibus test. Moreover, we explored the effect of matching pain intensity between groups or conditions based on perceived pain intensity of stimulus intensity. We found that approximately half of the reported comparisons of CP vs. HC and hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia (MAC\u2fffs) used standardised stimulus intensity (stimulus-matched paradigm) with the other half of studies adapting stimulus intensity to standardise perceived pain intensity (pain percept-matched paradigm). Due to the small sample sizes and potential inhomogeneity between these experiments, they were compared for differences using the omnibus test. \n\n\n### Neural pain response pattern in CP and HC \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis was used to find clusters of coordinates due to painful stimuli in HC and CP groups. The nearest Talairach structure to the centre of these clusters is reported, and considered to be of functional relevance to pain processing. The frequency with which each Talairach structure was reported was evaluated. \n\n\n### Differences in the pain response pattern between CP and HC \n  \nThe neural signature of pain in CP and HC subgroups were compared using CMA to explore differences in activation patterns, and using MAC to explore differences in activation intensity. It is expected that the likelihood of activation shows significant spatial differences, reflecting functional reorganisation as previously suggested ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). We furthermore expected MAC differences related to hyperalgesia in CP. \n\n#### Is functional reorganisation in CP limited to neuropathic pain? \n  \nCP studies were sub-grouped by etiology (neuropathic (NEUR ;  ), nociceptive musculo-skeletal (MSK ;  ), and fibromyalgia (FM ;  ). There are distinct neurophysiological differences between neuropathic and musculo-skeletal pain disorders with controversies regarding the classification of FM  ( ,  ,  ). Thus, there may be differences in the functional response to pain stimulation between these groups with the expectation that neuropathic pain is characterised by more prominent functional reorganisation. Relevant comparisons were made between these subgroups using CMA and the omnibus test of differences between groups. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by hyperalgesia in HC? \n  \nTo assess whether functional reorganisation in CP is related to peripheral and central sensitisation as putative mechanisms, we studied the activation pattern specific to experimental hyperalgesia in healthy controls as a model of pain sensitisation. To this end we studied the pattern of pain processing in HC after experimental induction of hyperalgesia (HYPER  subgroup;  ) in comparison with normalgesia by CBMA of the hyperalgesia group, and by CMA and MAC between hyperalgesia and normalgesia. The frequency of reporting brain structures activated in each group was also explored. We expected significantly increased likelihood and increased intensity of activation due to central sensitisation in hyperalgesia ( ). \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by low mood in HC? \n  \nTo assess whether functional reorganisation in CP can be modelled by emotional status during painful stimulation, we studied the activation pattern specific to low mood in healthy controls under painful stimulation. Due to incomplete study reporting, we were unable to perform CMA between normal and low mood. Instead, we performed MAC of studies comparing painful stimulation with or without concomitant low mood condition (LM  subgroup;  ). We expected to detect increase in activation intensity during the low mood condition in emotional circuits and structures contributing to central pain augmentation and chronification. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 3815 reported coordinates of activation foci were extracted from 178 papers reporting on 266 fMRI studies of cutaneous experimental pain in 3014 subjects: 180 studies involved HC (2278 subjects; median 12, range 4\u2fff61 per study), and 38 studies involved CP (506 subjects; median 12, range 5\u2fff83 per study) (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material for included studies and  ). Coordinates from experimental hyperalgesia in HC and CP (11 studies, 116 subjects; 3 studies, 26 subjects) and pain studies in HC involving low mood induction (5 studies, 114 subjects) were also extracted.   \nFlowchart of fMRI papers included in the analysis. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nThe studies were divided into modality and condition-specific sub datasets ( ). Relevant contrast data from 37 studies suitable for MAC were available for extraction from 34 papers ( ).   \nStudy groups included in the coordinate based meta-analysis of contrasts (MAC), consisting of coordinates from fMRI studies of between-group comparisons. \n  Table 2   \n\nChronic pain patient conditions included neuropathic pain syndromes (chronic regional pain syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a04, trigeminal neuralgia, n\u00a0=\u00a01; burning mouth disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a01; syringomyelia, n\u00a0=\u00a01; post-herpetic neuralgia, n\u00a0=\u00a02; peripheral neuropathy n\u00a0=\u00a03; headache, n\u00a0=\u00a03; vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a01); primary nociceptive musculo-skeletal disorders (low back pain, n\u00a0=\u00a06; osteoarthritis, n\u00a0=\u00a02) and fibromyalgia (FM, n\u00a0=\u00a08). We additionally subdivided CP studies according to the site of the nociceptive stimulation: at the most painful clinically affected site (CS ;  ), or at another body site (OS ;  ). \n\n### Experimental factors affecting the neural pain response pattern \n  \nSubgroups of HC studies using right sided pain stimuli (RIGHT ;  ) and left sided pain stimuli (LEFT ;  ) were compared using the omnibus test, with and without mirroring the coordinates in the latter group. The difference was significant when comparing the original coordinates (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.036), but much more so when comparison was done using mirrored coordinates from the left sided stimulus studies (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002) demonstrating highly significant lateralisation of neural pain processing that cannot be neglected. Consequently, all subsequent experiments used original coordinates only. \n\nThe three different modalities of pain stimulation (mechanical, electrical, thermal) showed largely overlapping brain activation patterns (data not shown). However, the omnibus test did suggest some differences (mechanical vs. thermal:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02; mechanical vs. electrical:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.04; electrical vs. thermal:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.16). \n\nWe compared HC studies contrasting pain against rest (subgroup REST ;  ) to studies contrasting pain against innocuous sensory stimuli (subgroup INNOC ;  ). No differences were detected (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nWe also compared studies employing cued painful stimulation (subgroup CUED ,  ) to non-cued painful stimulation (subgroup NCUED ,  ). Again, no differences were observed (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.13). \n\nWe compared the CP subgroup in which nociceptive stimulus was applied to the site of maximal clinical pain (CS ) to the CP subgroup in which painful stimulus was applied remotely to that site (OS ). The OS  subgroup included all eight FM studies, as none used stimulation of most painful body sites. The stimulated body parts in the two subgroups were: upper limb (CS  5 studies, OS  13 studies), lower limb (CS  6 studies, OS  1 study), trunk (3 studies\u2fffall CS ), and head and face (3 studies in each group). The omnibus test suggested some difference in activation pattern between these groups (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.006). We also compared the CS  group with an OS  group that excluded FM (OS-FM ). The omnibus test still indicated a difference in activation patterns between these groups (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.03). \n\nThe design differences in matching CP and controls for pain intensity were unlikely to have masked true group differences as a comparison by omnibus test of perception versus stimulus intensity matched studies revealed no difference (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.96). The same was found for hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia contrasts revealing no significantly difference when comparing perception and stimulus matched studies using the omnibus test (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nWe compared the CP subgroup employing allodynic pain stimulus to the subgroup employing noxious stimuli; allodynic (subgroup ALDN ;  ) vs. noxious (subgroup NOX ;  ). However, we detected no significant differences in the activation likelihood by omnibus test (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.46). \n\nAiming for large groups to increase power, subsequent experiments included studies using electrical, thermal, and mechanical modality types, rest and innocuous contrast conditions, cued and non-cued painful stimulus, and perception and stimulus intensity matched studies. However, the differences by pain stimulation modality, and by site of stimulation in the CP group, may be a source of heterogeneity. \n\n\n### The neural pain response pattern in chronic pain patients and in healthy controls \n  \nThe CBMA of nociceptive brain activation in the HC group revealed all \u2fffpain-matrix\u2fff processing areas (thalamus, INS, cingulate, PFC, S1, S2, parahippocampal gyrus, brainstem nuclei, basal ganglia,  a, Table S2.1). No single structure is reported by all studies. Right and left posterior insula (BA13) were the most consistent, each being reported in around 66% of studies. Other structures of the pain matrix were also among the most frequently reported. The bilateral BA40 (inferior parietal, S2) and left ACC (BA24) were reported in at least 1/3 studies. Ranked frequencies of the most often reported structures are given (blue in  ). Interestingly amygdala activation is reported in less than 5% of experiments.   \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of neural response to cutaneous painful stimulation showing significant activation likelihood maps [pain activation] for healthy controls (a, blue), chronic pain cohorts (b, red) and hyperalgesia (c, green). \n  Fig. 2   \n\nThe CBMA of CP studies revealed clusters of activation in 15 structures: bilateral thalamus, bilateral INS, left S2, left dorsal ACC (BA32), bilateral precentral (BA6&BA44) and postcentral gyri (BA40), right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral basal ganglia and left anterior cerebellum ( b, Table S2.2). \n\nThe frequency plot ( , red) depicts the most often reported activation sites in CP: the right posterior insula (BA13) was the most frequently reported (63% of all CP studies) followed by the left BA13 and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (S2; BA40) in 37\u2fff50% of all studies. Bilateral putamen was reported by 34% of all CP studies.   \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of significant aggregated contrasts between condition [pain activation during hyperalgesia\u00a0>\u00a0normalgesia] (MAC, a, green) and significant difference of activation likelihood maps between stimulation sites [most painful clinically affected (CS)\u00a0>\u00a0other site (OS)] (CMA b, red (CS\u00a0>\u00a0OS), blue (OS\u00a0>\u00a0CS)). \n  Fig. 3     \nFrequency of reported structures in HC (blue) and CP (red) groups. Structures reported at least by 10% of the studies in HC group are displayed (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.). \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n### Does the neural pain response pattern differ between CP and HC? \n  \nCBMA in both HC and CP groups revealed similar clusters. No significant spatial differences in the activation pattern were found by CMA. However, there was a trend towards a significant difference just beyond the FCDR threshold (CP\u00a0>\u00a0HC, FCDR\u00a0=\u00a00.13) in the left supramarginal gyrus (BA40). A comparison using the omnibus test suggested subtle global differences reaching significance (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.048). \n\nWe qualitatively compared the structures reported as activated in both groups (HC and CP) using a frequency plot ( ), and noticed that both groups reported activated structures with relatively similar frequencies. \n\nWhile no statistically significant spatial differences in activation patterns were detected, this does not rule out the possibility that there are consistent spatial activation intensity differences. Therefore, MAC of reported comparisons of CP and HC (CP activation\u00a0>HC activation, subgroup CP_HC ;  ) was performed, which did not reveal any significant clusters of activation intensity difference. In all but two of the included studies, the painful stimulation was applied to another part of the body that was remote from the site of clinical pain in the CP subjects. An additional MAC of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia condition within CP subjects (HYPER_CP ) was also non-significant but only included three studies. \n\nDue to the potential inhomogeneity introduced by the different pain stimulus modalities, we also compared HC and CP subgroups including only studies of mechanical pain stimulation (subgroups MECH  and MECH ;  ); this resulted in the largest possible (28 vs. 22 studies respectively) modality specific subgroup analyses. No significant differences were found by either CMA below an FCDR of 0.1, and the omnibus test of difference was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.79). \n\nIn line with our hypothesis of higher personal relevance of pain stimulation of the most painful clinically affected body part we compared the CS  and OS  subgroups. The CMA CS  vs. OS  revealed four clusters of more likely activation in the CS  group (left putamen; right posterior INS, right mid-INS and left middle frontal gyrus,  b), and one cluster of more likely activation in the OS  group (precentral gyrus,  b, Tables 2.3\u2fff2.5). The frequency plots of reported structures in the two CP sub-groups, and HC, are displayed in Fig. S1. Left putamen was reported by 50% of the CS  studies, 19% of the OS  studies and 28% of the HC studies. \n\n#### Is functional reorganisation in CP limited to neuropathic pain? \n  \nWe analysed by CBMA the neural signature of pain in neuropathic pain patients (subgroup NEUR ;  ), chronic conditions involving MSK pain (subgroup MSK ;  ), and FM (subgroup FM ;  ). The cerebral structures consistently activated in the three subgroups were not significantly different either by CMA or the omnibus test of difference (  p  \u00a0>\u00a00.05). Findings were also not significant when including FM in the neuropathic pain group. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by hyperalgesia in HC? \n  \nThe pain activation pattern in a model of peripheral and central sensitisation (experimental hyperalgesia in healthy controls, subgroup HYPER ,  ) is displayed in green in  c. It shows activations in left thalamus, bilateral INS, right dorsal ACC (BA32), right superior frontal gyrus and the left lentiform nucleus (Table S2.6). The frequency plots of reported structures activated by experimental hyperalgesia in HC are displayed in Fig. S2. Of note, left putamen was reported by 33% of HYPER  studies. \n\nThe CMA of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia in HC did not elicit significant local or diffuse differences (omnibus test:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.7). \n\n\n#### MAC of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia in HC \n  \nContrast data comparing experimental pain induced in the presence of hyperalgesia and experimental pain induced in normal condition (normalgesia) was available for extraction in eleven studies of which six used stimulus matched comparison (subgroup HYPER ,  ). MAC indeed revealed a multifocal effect of hyperalgesia on brain activation with significant clusters of increased activation in the dorsal ACC (BA32), bilateral INS (BA13), left insula (BA40), right IPL (S2, BA40), right middle frontal gyrus (BA9), and left striatum ( a, Table S2.7). The activation pattern is highly similar to the pain signature revealed by CBMA of the CP and HC groups ( a and b). These results suggest that hyperalgesia increases activation intensity in many of the known pain processing areas compared to normalgesia which may in part reflect the experimental design of stimulus intensity rather than perception matching in five studies. Nevertheless, when inspecting the paradigms of those studies contributing to significant clusters perception-based matching designs contributed to all clusters. \n\nIt should be noted however, that at least two of four studies (from the same centre) contributed to all of the significant clusters that possibly contain overlapping subject samples ( ,  ,  ,  ). As this could not be proved conclusively, no study was excluded. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by low mood in HC? \n  \nMAC comparing experimental pain induced in the presence of low mood and experimental pain induced in the absence of low mood included data from only five studies (subgroup LM_HC ,  ). MAC did not detect regions of consistently increased or decreased activation in the presence of low mood. Activation foci for the low mood condition were only reported seperately in one study so no CBMA was possible. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies demonstrated remarkably similar patterns with no significant spatial differences in nociceptive processing across all conditions of pain stimulation in chronic pain compared to healthy controls in normalgesia as well as after induced hyperalgesia. The subgroup of studies applying painful stimuli to the most painful clinically affected body part in CP, however, revealed that activation was significantly more likely in the left putamen, right mid and posterior insula and left middle frontal gyrus than if nociceptive stimuli are applied elsewhere. In contrast, there were no local differences in likelihood of activation between experimental hyperalgesia and normalgesia but activation intensity was upregulated in many of the pain processing areas including left anterior medial striatum and bilateral insula. \n\nThe cutaneous pain fMRI response pattern was very similar in healthy controls and chronic pain patients, and no spatial difference was detected by contrast meta-analysis; a finding reflected in the similarity of the per-structure activation report frequencies for the two groups. This finding was unexpected as functional studies are commonly referenced to evidence nociceptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain. The lack of a consistent shift of the spatial representation of nociceptive processing in clinical pain patients vs. controls is in stark contrast to previous coordinate based meta-analyses ( ,  ) that, however, contradict each other. Lanz et al. reported significantly more likely activated S2, contralateral SMA and ipsilateral cerebellum in patients vs. controls, but less likely activation in S1, insula, ACC, PFC, thalamus and cerebellum. By contrast, Friebel reported stronger convergence of activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, right anterior insula and left ACC in patients and reduced activation likelihood in the left posterior, right anterior insula, right SMA and S2. These discrepancies can be explained by methodological differences: Lanz et al. used a null hypothesis that coordinates were randomly distributed ( ), while Friebel et al. used a more appropriate permutation of the grouping variable, but did not correct for multiple voxel-wise statistical tests. Another important limitation of previous pain CBMAs is lack of consideration for the correlation between coordinates reported by similar experiments using the same subjects; it is important that these coordinates are not treated as independent ( ). Indeed, when rerunning the CBMA without appropriate merging, eight clusters were detected comparing the CP and HC groups (data not shown). Therefore, previously reported group differences might be explained by lack of rigorous data merging as required for any meta-analysis, or by inadequate statistical methodology. \n\nRegardless of the appropriateness of statistical inferences made, CMA can only test for consistent differences in the pattern of reported activation between groups, and not for possible differences in activation intensity within shared activations. This can be addressed by aggregating reported activation foci detected by studies comparing groups, such as HC and CP. MAC of data from eighteen eligible studies did not reveal spatially consistent activation intensity differences between CP and healthy controls. Five pain fMRI studies comparing CP and HC failed to show significant results on direct comparison of the CP and HC groups. Furthermore, seven studies did not report the results of comparison between these groups. It is conceivable that this represents a publication bias as authors might have refrained from undertaking between group comparison due to expected low power or from reporting negative results, which either way would be in line with the negative MAC result. \n\nFailure to observe a consistent localised differential activation pattern across the studied populations and experimental designs does not exclude possible subtle widespread differences in activation pattern, or differences limited to specific patient subgroups or experimental settings; for example a systematic anterior shift of insular activation was reported for neuropathic patients ( ). Also, a recent detailed analysis demonstrated plasticity of the somatosensory system only in patients with chronic neuropathic pain ( ). Therefore, we additionally tested for global differences in the activation pattern between groups, and subgroups, using a more sensitive omnibus test ( ). This suggested a subtle global differences across activation patterns between the HC and CP (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.048). Importantly, functional reorganisation is likely moderated by pain etiology and phenotype, but the neuropathic and nociceptive subgroups were not detectably different from the HC group. Furthermore, there is some uncertainty how to classify patients with fibromyalgia (FM), and individual pain fMRI studies suggested hyperactivation of the insula which might reflect the postulated multisensory sensation syndrome in FM ( ). However, no differences between the subgroup of eight pain fMRI studies in FM and healthy controls were detected. \n\nThe experimental conditions are known to affect the pattern and intensity of fMRI response in healthy controls, so it is unclear how to best study brain plasticity in CP. Intuitively, eliciting clinical pain would be most relevant. However, as this is not always possible, we subgrouped CP studies according to whether the stimulus was applied on the clinically affected body part or remotely. When exposed to experimental painful stimulation of their most painful clinically affected body part, CP exhibited consistently higher likelihood of activation in the left putamen, left middle frontal gyrus, right posterior and mid INS. Post hoc analysis comparing activation patterns on clinical site stimulation to healthy controls revealed the two most significant stuctures were the left putamen and right INS, but these were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This is also suggested by the frequency plots showing putaminal activation in 28% of HC pain fMRI studies in contrast to 50% in CP exposed to nociception of the affected body part. We did not identify any other experimental factor (pain modality, cued vs. non cued, control condition) predicting the increased likelihood of putaminal activation. \n\nThe putamen is not considered part of the common neural signature of pain, with its main function being motor and implicit learning. Recently, however, a compelling case was made that the putamen may play a key role in co-ordinating nociceptive, sensory and cognitive-emotional pain processing ( ). Such a role is foremost supported by the anatomical connectedness of the putamen; probabilistic tractography revealed that the putamen is not only interconnected with sensori-motor circuits but also nociceptive and attention areas including ACC, INS and thalamus, emotional and memory networks including the amygdala, hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN)/ventral tegmental area (VTA) ( ). SN and VTA both receive direct afferent nociceptive information from the spinal cord via the parabrachial nucleus in the midbrain, and activate the putamen during pain ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Importantly, the putamen can shape activity in large areas of cortex via differentially modulating the levels of inhibition into the thalamus in both animals and humans ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Mechanistic support also comes from a study in patients with putamenal lesions who demonstrated decreased pain sensitivity and widespread decreases in pain-related brain activation ( ). \n\nWe propose that the putamen plays a specific role in the maladaptive state of chronic pain related to affective learning. Several functional neuroimaging studies showed putaminal/striatal activation in aversive learning ( ), disgust ( ), and hate ( ). Putamen activation was also directly linked to learning of pain-related fear ( ), with co-activation during early acquisition even in a rapid conditioned aversive learning paradigm using visceral pain as an unconditioned stimulus ( ). A link of the observed increased putaminal activation in CP with aversive affective learning is also in line with recently reported coordinate based meta-analysis of fMRI studies on emotion regulation finding increased striatal activation during emotional upregulation, which was interpreted to be reflective of its role in affective learning and the initial stages of action preparation ( ). Of note, most of the studies included in Frank et al. involve unpleasant stimuli, ( ). The observed modified putaminal response to pain stimulation of clinically affected body parts might thus reflect implicit aversive learning and consecutive enhanced affective regulation ( ). \n\nIntriguingly, putamen activation is an emerging hallmark of spontaneous pain processing in clinical pain as assessed by PET ( ) and arterial spin labelling ( ,  ,  ). These studies consistently reported increased blood flow and metabolism indexing neural activity in the left putamen in patients with on-going pain. Further supporting a key role for the putamen in pain augmentation comes from the observation of high incidence of pain in Parkinson\u2fffs characterised by putaminal dopaminergic denervation ( ), putaminal dopaminergic deficit in chronic pain patients ( ), and an inverse link between D2 receptors and dopamine availability and pain sensitivity in healthy controls ( ). Taken together with our findings this provides evidence for a previously unrecognised key role of the putamen in maladaptive neuroplasticity in the chronic pain state, which is likely to reflect emotional upregulation. Our finding of modified putamen activity linked to pain stimulation of the affected body part highlights that functional reorganisation in CP is site-sepecific. This could possibly result from local and regional sensitisation as well as conditional augmentation which is dependent upon it\u2fffs contextual relevance in line with implicit aversive learning. \n\nNoxious stimulation at the most painful clinically affected site in CP also induced more right posterior INS activation, which likely reflects CP induced hyperalgesia. In fact, the posterior insula is the most consistently reported brain activation site across all pain conditions and groups (frequency plots). This is in line with direct stimulation experiments showing that pain perception can only be elicited from the posterior insula ( ). Our result concords with recent evidence for a close correlation of pain perception with regional blood flow increase in the posterior insula ( ). Posterior INS also encodes intensity of a pain stimulus ( ) and is hence a plausible neural correlate of hyperalgesia. Peripheral and central sensitisation are increasingly recognised not only in neuropathic but also primary nociceptive chronic pain syndromes such as OA, leading to local and, to a lesser extent, remote hyperalgesia evidenced by reduced pain thresholds ( ). Given the core role of the posterior insula for pain perception, increased activation likely reflects hyperalgesia in chronic pain. Moreover, INS activation correlates with unpleasantesness of thermal hyperalgesia ( ) and is involved in modulation of the affective aspect of sensory perception by pain expectation ( ). Multiple functional associations have been reported for the middle frontal gyrus (BA9), including attention to negative emotional stimuli ( ). Interstingly, BA9 was also significantly more likely to be activated in clinical site vs. other site pain stimulation. \n\nA main aim of our meta-analysis was to investigate the nature of maladaptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain using a mechanistically based approach. The most popular model of pain sensitisation is experimentally induced transient hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers using capsaicin to reduce pain thresholds locally and remotely for homo- and heteromodal nociception thus modelling both peripheral and central sensitisation ( ). Should the observed increased likelihood of putaminal, middle frontal and mid and posterior INS activation in CP stimulated at the clinical site be caused by sensitisation alone, we would expect a similar difference to emerge from experimental hyperalgesia. In contrast, we found no differences between the aggregate response pattern to cutaneous noxious stimuli in experimental hyperalgesic vs. normalgesic. The smallest   p   value for the left putamen from this CMA (HYPER  vs HC) was 0.014, which is far above the threshold for significance after correction for multiple comparisons. This is not surprising, as the frequency plots show left putamen and right INS being reported with close frequencies by studies in both groups: 33% HYPER  and 28% in the HC group (left putamen); 77% HYPER  and 66% in the HC (right INS). This is again in clear contradiction with previous CMA findings that described a higher activation likelihood of bilateral S2 and prefrontal cortex, right ACC, left basal ganglia and cerebellum in hyperalgesia/allodynia as well as reduced activation likelihood of the right insula, left ACC and prefrontal cortex, bilateral thalamus and bilateral basal ganglia ( ). As discussed above the fundamental differences in statistical inference explain the stark differences. \n\nIntriguingly, while we found no spatial differences in the activation likelihood pattern using CMA, using MAC we found several clusters of consistently increased activation intensity as a neural correlate of central sensitisation. The observed hyperactivity pattern in experimental hyperalgesia includes many pain processing areas with the mid-left ACC, bilateral insula, right S2, left striatum in addition to the right middle frontal gyrus. The most parsimonous explanation would thus be that the brain correlate of central sensitisation is a generalised upregulation of pain processing. This in turn would be in line with the behavioral hyperalgesia and mechanistically with increased nociceptive signalling ( ). The pattern also closely resembles regions identified to encode perceived pain intensity ( ) including the salience network (anterior INS and ACC). Increased salience network activation furthermore accords well with the real world experience of heightened arousal and cognitive attention in hyperalgesia/allodynia induced by sunburn. The lack of altered activation likelihood, however, suggests that   transient   central sensitisation is insufficient to induce functional brain reorganisation. Moreover, the pattern of the neural pain response modulated by experimental cutaneous hyperalgesia is largely dissociated from that in CS  demonstrating that experimental hyperalgesia does not mimic neuroplasticity in clinical pain. Importantly, these dissociations cast doubt on the validity of experimental hyperalgesia as model for assessing analgesics for chronic pain conditions ( ). \n\nWhen comparing the hyperalgesia pattern identified using MAC with the altered activation likelihood pattern in CS  only remote similarities can be noted. From 7 clusters in the hyperalgesia-normalgesia contrast, only two clusters showed proximity to the CS  pattern: the left lentiform nucleus cluster in hyperalgesia maps adjacent (more medial, anterior and inferiorly) to the left putamen maximum in CS ; and secondly the right mid insula (BA13) in hyperalgesia locates anteriorly to the right mid insular cluster of increased activation likelihood in CS . Despite the predominant dissociation of experimental hyperalgesia and CS , the proximity of some activation foci point to possible partially shared mechanisms. Against the background of known pain sensitisation in both conditions, the different type of pain activation augmentation (increased activation intensity vs. likelihood) in adjacent regions might reflect the dynamics of transient to chronic central sensitisation. It is intriguing to speculate that regional hyperactivation as demonstrated by a model of central sensitisation over time may result in functional reorganisation indexed as increased activation likelihood in chronic pain. \n\nThe aggregate cutaneous pain response pattern identified from this coordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies is confirmatory of previous meta-analysis in healthy subjects reflecting the expected multidimensional neural networks contributing to the subjective pain experience. The consistently activated brain regions represent the so called neural signature of pain ( ), formerly referred to as \u2fffpain matrix\u2fff ( ), and include the sensory nociceptive loop (brainstem, S1, S2, posterior insula, thalami), the salience network (ACC, anterior insula), prefrontal cortex and striatum. None of these brain activations are specific for pain ( ), but the fine grained neural activation pattern identified through machine learning was shown to predict physical pain with 94% accuracy, and even analysis of activation patterns within single regions (dorsal ACC, anterior INS, S2 and post INS) achieved on average better than 75% sensitivity and specificity ( ). This consistent neural signature of pain does, however, not translate into the same consistency of identified activation foci across pain fMRI studies included in our analysis. Our frequency plot analysis that is directly comparable to systematic reviews performed before advent of coordinate based spatial MA confirms that the posterior insula (right and left) is the most consistently reported structure. However, it is noteworthy that more than 1 in 3 fMRI pain studies do not report activation of the posterior insula. This highlights a remarkable sensitivity issue of current pain fMRI studies rather than a genuine variability of pain processing as functional imaging studies are known for very low statistical power ( ). \n\nThe main limitations of this coordinate based meta-analysis are the limited number, and heterogeneity, of chronic pain fMRI studies as well as inconsistent reporting. With 266 studies included this is one of the largest and arguably most rigorous pain fMRI CBMA to date in healthy volunteers but numbers in chronic pain patients and hyperalgesic conditions are lower. In particular, there were only few cutaneous pain fMRI studies in low mood, which reported contrasts only, precluding the possibility of mood-related CMA and preventing firm interpretation of the negative results of the low vs. normal mood meta-analysis of contrasts. Importantly, there is substantial variation across studies in which criteria were applied to report \u2fffpeak activation\u2fff depending on the analysis methods used, in particular the thresholds used which varied between   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, FDR and FWE correction. This reflects the lack of consensus on standards, use of different software packages and versions and incomplete reporting in the field of functional neuroimaging (reviewed by  ). Also, only one in five of the included studies reported coordinates for functional deactivation precluding a meta-analysis of this important feature of nociceptive response. This and the lack of included CBF studies of spontaneous pain prevent a direct comparison with the meta-analysis reported by ( ), which was largely based on PET studies. We chose to limit our meta-analysis to fMRI as strong method dependent differences were reported previously ( ). \n\nAnother important limitation is the incomplete reporting of pain intensity which results in the inability to control for perceived pain intensity between subgroups. Nevertheless, in those studies where the group comparisons were directly reported and extracted (for the MAC analyses) we found a balanced count of studies using percept or stimulus intensity matched paradigms. As these numbers were low, additional subgroup analyses were not carried out, Thus we cannot disentangle the effects of transient central sensitisation from experimentally designed differences in pain intensity encoding. We did not extract pain anticipatory brain activity, which might reveal additional CP specific alterations as there were so few studies reporting on this in CP cohorts. \n\nWe limited this coordinate based meta-analysis to the more commonly used cutaneous pain stimuli, and can thus not generalise our findings to deep pain stimulation of muscle or viscera. Hence we also did not include muscle or visceral experimental hyperalgesia, which conceivably might heighten pain unpleasantness and thus might more closely match the neural signature of chronic pain. \n\nIn general, we found that only a minority of CP studies and not all experimental hyperalgesia studies reported results (co-ordinates) from between condition/group comparisons. This is highly recommended for future pain fMRI studies as MAC is a powerful alternative to CMA for several reasons: (i) the direct between group or condition comparison is an effective way to controlling for unwanted heterogeneity resulting from technical and experimental specificities between studies, (ii) the advantages of careful matching of case control studies are only preserved in MAC but not CMA, and (iii) MAC is sensitive to differences in activation strength. Current drives for publicly available neuroimaging repositories will have the additional advantage for large pooled image based analysis with the potential of further advances over CBMA ( ) provided effective and validated means for controlling study-and scanner specific bias become available. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of superficial pain fMRI studies using statistically rigorous methodology revealed remarkably similar activation patterns in healthy controls during normalgesia and hyperalgesia and chronic pain patients. However, we describe a consistent pattern of hyperactivation in experimental hyperalgesia as model of transient central sensitisation. Also, we identified increased likelihood of left putaminal, right middle frontal gyrus and mid/posterior insular activation when stimulating the clinically affected site in CP, which we interpret to reflect neuroplasticity linked to chronic sensitisation augmented by aversive contextual learning. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 5554296, "text_md5": "110481105d6d48d5d7bb5c34bdb1d8aa", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 126], "publication_year": [128, 132], "title": [143, 297], "keywords": [311, 395], "abstract": [408, 2061], "body": [2070, 63166]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 27168346, "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.04.001", "pmcid": "5554296", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554296", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5554296"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554296\">5554296</a>", "list_title": "PMC5554296  Functional reorganisation in chronic pain and neural correlates of pain sensitisation: A coordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies"}

MRI markers hold potential to contribute to identification of patients at risk for cognitive impairments and clarification of mechanisms. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and value the evidence on MRI markers of memory, attention, and executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. We included ninety-eight studies, on six classes of MRI factors (location and severity of damage (n\u00a0=\u00a015), volume/atrophy (n\u00a0=\u00a036), signs of small vessel disease (n\u00a0=\u00a015), diffusion-weighted imaging measures (n\u00a0=\u00a036), resting-state functional MRI measures (n\u00a0=\u00a013), and arterial spin labeling measures (n\u00a0=\u00a01)). Three measures showed consistent results regarding their association with cognition. Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with worse memory in fourteen studies (pooled correlation 0.58 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.68] for whole, 0.11 [95% CI: 0.04\u20130.19] for left, and 0.34 [95% CI: 0.17\u20130.49] for right hippocampus). Lower fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix was associated with worse memory in six and five studies (pooled correlation 0.20 [95% CI: 0.08\u20130.32] and 0.29 [95% CI: 0.20\u20130.37], respectively). Lower functional connectivity within the default-mode network was associated with worse cognition in four studies. In conclusion, hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network showed consistent associations with cognitive performance in all types of acute onset brain injury. External validation and cut off values for predicting cognitive impairments are needed for clinical implementation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcute onset brain injury resulting from postanoxic encephalopathy (PAE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or stroke is a common cause of death or disability, with an incidence of 50\u20131,507 per 100,000 people a year, worldwide ( ,  ,  ). Over the past years, survival rates have increased ( ,  ,  ), leading to more people living with the consequences of acute onset brain injury. \n\nImpairments of memory, attention, and executive functioning are frequently reported in patients after acute onset brain injury ( ,  ,  ) and strongly related to reduced quality of life ( ,  ,  ). International experts recommend screening to identify patients at risk for enduring cognitive impairments ( ,  ,  ). Subsequently, those at risk could be provided with cognitive rehabilitation therapy. \n\nMRI markers may contribute to identification of patients at risk for cognitive impairments and clarify underlying mechanisms. The majority of research on this topic has been performed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases or dementia. Some main findings are that lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple brain regions ( ), lower functional connectivity (FC) within the default-mode network (DMN) ( ), and lower hippocampal and cortical volumes ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive performance. \n\nIn patients with acute onset brain injury similar MRI markers have been associated with cognitive performance. In ischemic stroke and TBI patients, lower hippocampal volume ( ), lower FA in the cingulum ( ), and lower FC in resting-state networks ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive functioning. However, lack of uniformity of the evidence, resulting from a large variability of study designs and reported effect sizes, hampers valuing and comparing the various reported MRI markers of cognitive function after acute onset brain injury. Since patients with PAE, TBI, or stroke may face similar cognitive impairments, it is interesting to group these patients to find MRI markers associated with these impairments after acute onset brain injury. Systematic reviews, but more importantly meta-analyses summarizing and interpreting these results in the complete acute onset brain injury population are lacking. Therefore, the possible value of MRI for predicting cognitive impairments after acute onset brain injury is still unsure. \n\nHere, we provide a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of MRI factors associated with (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. Furthermore, we present which early MRI factors have been reported to predict long term (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. These cognitive domains are among the most affected after stroke, TBI and PAE. With this review we aim to value and rank the evidence and provide a starting point for studies on mechanisms and predictive values of MRI factors of cognitive impairments after acute onset brain injury. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThe protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO:CRD42021229488) and reported here along PRISMA guidelines. \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed on January 8th 2021 using Scopus and PubMed. Search strategies are displayed in Online Resource Tables S1 and S2. \n\n\n### Selection of articles \n  \nTwo reviewers (MV,AG) independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full texts, using Rayyan QCRI. Disagreements were discussed to reach consensus. \n\nInclusion criteria were:   \nObservational cohort studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal). \n  \nAdult (\u226518\u00a0years) acute onset brain injury population (or mixed sample with separate analysis of acute brain injury population). This included patients with TBI, stroke, and PAE. Populations with repetitive injury (sports players, soldiers or veterans, and patients with small vessel disease without acute onset injury) were excluded. \n  \nResting-state cerebral MRI performed (or mixed sample with separate analysis of MRI data). \n  \nMemory, attention and/or executive functioning evaluated using neuropsychological tests with known psychometric quality and validity in the acute onset brain injury population. We only included tests with diagnostic values for distinguishing impairments from normal functioning (z-scores, norm scores, thresholds), validated in the acute onset brain injury population, and used by more than one research group. Tests primarily used and intended for research setting were not included. Cognitive impairments mostly caused by focal brain lesions, like aphasia or neglect, were not regarded. \n  \nPublished between 2000 and January 2021. \n  \nWritten in English. \n  \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe first reviewer (MV) extracted the following data from the articles: study design, inclusion & exclusion criteria, demographics (number of patients, age, sex, education), MRI (timing, sequence parameters, analysis, predictors), cognition (timing, domain, test(s), analysis, scoring method), correlation coefficients, odds ratios, group differences, or regression parameters. We assumed that MRI and cognitive testing were performed on approximately the same day in case of a cross-sectional study design. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe first reviewer (MV) performed quality assessment based on the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool ( ). Six bias domains were rated as having high, moderate or low risk of bias. \n\nWe used the four most important domains for our review (prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting) to evaluate overall risk of bias, since these domains significantly influence associations between the MRI markers and cognitive outcome measures, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall risk was defined as low (at least three low risk domains, no high risk domains), moderate (at least two low risk domains, at most one high risk domain), or high. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nData are presented in a descriptive way in tables and figures. The first reviewer (MV) performed meta-analyses in R (v4.0.0, R Foundation) for associations described in five or more articles ( ). Only correlation coefficients based on predefined ROIs were taken into account to prevent inclusion of impossibly high correlations caused by circularity errors ( ,  ,  ). Pooled correlation coefficients were calculated with a random effects model. Missing data were requested from the corresponding authors by e-mail with a reminder after one week. In case of no or negative response, missing results were not included in meta-analyses. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nLiterature search resulted in 1,856 unique titles. Based on screening of title and abstract (n\u00a0=\u00a01,856) and full texts (n\u00a0=\u00a0405), we included 98 articles ( ).   \nOverview of the article selection process. \n  \n\n### Characteristics of the included studies \n  \nThe majority of studies were cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a069, 70\u00a0%). The remaining 29 (30\u00a0%) were longitudinal. \n\nAll three patient populations were studied: PAE (n\u00a0=\u00a05), TBI (n\u00a0=\u00a059), and stroke (n\u00a0=\u00a034). The numbers of participants per study ranged from 5 to 395 (6,279 in total). The range of mean ages in studies on PAE was 43\u201364, on TBI 22\u201349, and on stroke 40\u201377\u00a0years. \n\nMemory was tested most frequently (n\u00a0=\u00a088), followed by executive functioning (n\u00a0=\u00a059), and attention (n\u00a0=\u00a035). Used neuropsychological tests and timing of testing varied greatly. Information on used neuropsychological tests and timing is presented in Online Resource Tables S3 \u2013 S8. Six classes of MRI measures were studied: location and severity of damage (n\u00a0=\u00a015), volume/atrophy (n\u00a0=\u00a036), signs of small vessel disease (n\u00a0=\u00a015), diffusion-weighted imaging measures (n\u00a0=\u00a036), resting-state functional MRI measures (n\u00a0=\u00a013), and arterial spin labeling measures (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Time between injury and cognitive testing or MRI ranged from a few days to 49\u00a0years and time from MRI to cognitive testing from a few hours to three years. \n\nThe overall risk of bias was low in 48 studies (49\u00a0%), moderate in 39 studies (40\u00a0%), and high in eleven studies (11\u00a0%). Risk of bias was highest in study confounding and statistical analysis and reporting domains.   shows study characteristics including risk of bias.   \nCharacteristics of included studies. \n    \n\n\n### Results of the included studies \n  \n#### Location and extent of damage \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on location and extent of damage are summarized in Online Resource Table S3. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLarger lesion volume ( ,  ,  ), damage to the mammillothalamic tract ( ), lower grey matter density ( ), and lower grey matter/white matter contrast ( ) were associated with worse memory performance. Six studies reported absence of an association between damage and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLeft-sided lesions were associated with worse attention performance than right-sided lesions ( ). Three studies reported absence of an association between damage and attention ( ,  ,  ). \n\nDamage to the lateral cholinergic projections ( ) was associated with worse executive functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between damage and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLarger lesion volume was predictive for worse memory performance at one\u00a0year, while right sided lesions and cortical lesions were predictive for better memory performance ( ). \n\nBilateral lesions were predictive for worse executive functioning ( ). Presence of DWI lesions was predictive for more decline in executive functioning in the first six\u00a0months ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Volume/atrophy \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on cerebral volume/atrophy are summarized in Online Resource Table S4. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nStudies in all three populations showed significant associations between volumes of hippocampus or amygdala and memory performance, wherein poorer memory performance was associated with lower volumes ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Only one study showed absence of a significant correlation ( ). Pooled correlation coefficients for whole, left and right hippocampus with memory performance were 0.58 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.68], 0.11 [95% CI: 0.04\u20130.19], and 0.34 [95% CI: 0.17\u20130.49], respectively ( a, Table S1). Demographic data and study design of the studies included in meta-analyses are shown in  . Furthermore, smaller volumes of grey matter ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), white matter ( ,  ,  ), multiple brain lobes ( ,  ), cingulate gyrus ( ), and mammillothalamic tract ( ) were correlated with worse memory performance. On the other hand, larger volumes of CSF ( ,  ,  ) and higher atrophy rates of cortex ( ), left thalamus ( ), and medial temporal lobe ( ) were associated with worse performance. Five studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ).  a shows an overview of the number of studies that described a positive correlation between brain volumes and memory performance.   \nForest plots for the correlations between MRI markers and memory functioning. a.

Positive correlation between brain volume and memory performance. Highlighted structures include (dark to light) hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and temporal lobe. b. Positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and memory performance. Highlighted regions include (dark to light) cingulum, fornix, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. \n  \n\nSmaller volumes of grey matter ( ) and cingulate gyrus ( ), and higher atrophy rates of cortex ( ,  ), white matter ( ), multiple gyri ( ), and temporal lobe ( ) were associated with worse attention performance. Five studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and attention ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOne study showed a significant association between lower hippocampal volume and worse executive functioning ( ), while three other studies showed no association ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, smaller cortical volumes ( ,  ,  ), larger ventricle volumes ( ,  ), and higher atrophy rates of whole brain ( ), temporal and frontal lobes ( ,  ), and cortex ( ) were associated with worse performance. Eight studies reported absence of an association between brain volume and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower hippocampal volume at three to six months was predictive for memory decline between three to six months and three years ( ). Furthermore, higher atrophy rates of total brain, right and left temporal lobe, and frontal lobe were predictive for attention and executive functioning, but not memory performance, at twelve months ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Signs of small vessel disease \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on small vessel disease measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S5. This class was only investigated after stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nMore severe white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) ( ) and presence of WMHs in target regions ( ), were associated with worse memory performance. Four studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nWMHs in target regions were associated with worse attention performance ( ). Three studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or CMBs and attention ( ,  ,  ). \n\nMore severe WMHs ( ,  ,  ,  ), WMHs in target regions ( ,  ), and number and location of CMBs ( ) were associated with worse executive functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between WMHs or CMBs and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nWMH volume was predictive for larger memory decline in the first three years after the event ( ). Furthermore, presence of CMBs, multilocular CMBs, more WMHs, and more deep WMHs were predictive for worse memory performance at three to six months ( ,  ). One study showed no prediction of reverting from memory impairments to normal memory functioning based on CMBs ( ). \n\nPresence of CMBs and multilocular CMBs were also predictive for worse executive functioning at six months, but not for attention performance ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Diffusion-weighted imaging \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on diffusion-weighted imaging measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S6. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ,  ,  ), cingulum ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), fornix ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), uncinate fasciculus ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ,  ) were associated with worse memory performance. A larger number of brain regions with reduced FA correlated with worse functioning ( ). Pooled correlation coefficients for FA in cingulum and fornix with memory performance were 0.20 [95% CI: 0.08\u20130.32] and 0.29 [95% CI: 0.20\u20130.37], respectively ( b and c). Demographic data and study design of the studies included in meta-analyses are shown in  .  b shows an overview of the number of studies that described a positive correlation between FA of specific brain regions and memory performance. \n\nResults for diffusivity measures were not as straightforward. Worse memory performance was associated with lower diffusivity in thalamus ( ,  ), external capsule ( ), corpus callosum ( ), and total white matter ( ), and higher diffusivity in splenium ( ) and temporal lobe ( ). Higher kurtosis in cingulum, centrum semiovale, and total white matter was associated with worse performance ( ), while lower kurtosis in superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with worse memory ( ). \n\nIn structural connectivity analyses, disruptions of the cingulum ( ), fornix ( ), connection between cingulum and brainstem ( ), or structural connectome ( ) were found in patients with worse memory performance. Higher betweenness centrality in multiple gyri was associated with better memory functioning ( ). Seven studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ), cingulum ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ) was associated with worse attention functioning. Higher diffusivity in the thalamus was associated with worse attention functioning ( ,  ). Lower kurtosis was associated with worse attention performance ( ). Four studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and attention ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FA in corpus callosum ( ), cingulum ( ), uncinate fasciculus ( ), and superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ,  ) was also associated with worse executive functioning. A higher number of brain regions with reduced FA was associated with worse performance ( ). Higher diffusivity in corpus callosum ( ,  ), cingulum ( ), and frontal white matter ( ,  ) was associated with worse executive functioning, as well. In structural connectivity analysis, disruption of structural connectome was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). Lower eigenvector centrality in left peri-callosal region, right superior frontal gyrus, left thalamus, left caudate, left insula, and right cingulate cortex was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). Four studies reported absence of an association between anisotropy or diffusivity and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower FA and higher diffusivity in cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and interior longitudinal fasciculus was predictive for worse memory performance at least one year later ( ). However, in the uncinate fasciculus, both lower FA and lower AD were predictive for worse memory performance ( ). Furthermore, higher betweenness centrality in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus was predictive for worse memory performance after three months ( ). \n\nIn contrast, higher FA and lower diffusivity in anterior corona radiate, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus were predictive for worse attention performance at least one year later ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Resting-state functional MRI \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on resting-state functional MRI markers are summarized in Online Resource Table S7. This class was only investigated after TBI or stroke. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nLower FC between nodes within the DMN ( ,  ,  ) and between the DMN and right middle frontal gyrus ( ) was associated with worse memory performance. In contrast, higher FC between DMN and right cingulate gyrus, left claustrum, and left inferior frontal gyrus was associated with worse performance ( ). Additionally, multiple functional connections were associated with memory functioning: FC within right anterior caudate ( ), FC between left thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus ( ), FC between dorsal attention network and right precentral gyrus ( ), and FC between bilateral temporal gyri ( ). Decreased spontaneous neural activity and decreased regional homogeneity in the cingulate gyrus ( ,  ) were associated with worse memory functioning. Four studies reported absence of an association between FC and memory ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLower FC within the DMN ( ,  ,  ) and sensorimotor network ( ) was associated with worse attention functioning. Furthermore, decreased regional homogeneity within the cingulate cortex was associated with worse attention ( ). \n\nLower FC in caudate ( ) was associated with worse executive functioning. Three studies reported absence of an association between FC and executive functioning ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nLower FC in the occipital cerebellar network was predictive for worse memory performance six months later ( ). \n\nLower FC in the DMN, salience network, dorsal attention network, and orbitofrontal network was predictive for worse attention six months later ( ). Furthermore, higher FC between the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal network was predictive for worse attention performance ( ). \n\n\n\n#### Arterial spin labeling \n  \nCharacteristics and results of studies on arterial spin labeling measures are summarized in Online Resource Table S8. This class was only investigated after TBI. \n\n##### Associations \n  \nDecreased cerebral blood flow in regions of interest (regions with lower cerebral blood flow in patients than in healthy controls) was associated with worse executive functioning ( ). \n\n\n##### Prediction \n  \nDecreased cerebral blood flow in regions of interest was not predictive for memory or executive functioning at six to twelve months ( ). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWith this systematic review and meta-analysis we provide an overview of MRI factors associated with or predictive for (impairments of) memory, attention, or executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. Our results show that hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in multiple regions, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network were associated with in cross-sectional studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and predictive for (impairments of) function in these cognitive domains in longitudinal studies ( ,  ,  ). Due to the low number of studies included in meta-analyses and high heterogeneity of studies, evidence is weak. \n\nOur results show that smaller brain volumes and larger ventricles have been associated with and were predictive for worse cognitive performance. Especially lower hippocampal volume has repeatedly been associated with worse memory ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Since included studies could not compare post-injury with pre-injury results, it is unclear whether volume changes caused by the injury or preexistent atrophy was studied. However, since multiple studies found consonant results regardless of the MRI timing, volumes of the hippocampus and other target regions are probably an important determinant of post-injury memory (impairments). \n\nDiffusion-tensor imaging showed that lower FA in multiple white matter tracts, especially in cingulum and fornix, was associated with worse cognition ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). FA has mainly been investigated in patients with TBI, so associations after acute onset brain injury from other causes are unclear. Lower FA indicates less intact white matter tracts and low FA values in our study population probably indicate injury induced white matter damage ( ). Results of a longitudinal predictive study on diffusivity measures showed that higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity were predictive for worse attention performance, while in cross-sectional studies higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity were always associated with worse performance ( ). \n\nLower FC within the DMN was associated with worse cognitive performance ( ,  ,  ,  ). Of all resting state networks, the DMN was studied most. The DMN comprises the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, inferior parietal lobe, lateral temporal cortex, and hippocampal formation ( ). Although the precise function of the DMN is incompletely understood, it has been established that this network is involved in multiple cognitive functions ( ). This applies to connectivity within the network ( ) as well as for the individual brain areas belonging to the network. The posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory encoding and consolidation ( ), while the medial prefrontal cortex participates in error identification ( ). Acute onset brain injury may affect nodes of the DMN as well as inter-nodal connections. \n\nResults of three other classes of MRI measures were not straightforward. The association between lesion volume and cognitive performance was inconsistent ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Signs of small vessel disease showed conflicting results. Some studies showed significant correlations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), while other did not ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). This type of abnormality is mostly chronic and preexistent ( ). Arterial spin labeling was only investigated in one study ( ). \n\nOur review shows that results from longitudinal predictive studies are not always in accordance with those from cross-sectional studies. This indicates the need for longitudinal studies on potential MRI markers that may predict (impairments of) cognition, since cross-sectional studies are not sufficient. \n\nOur results are consistent with studies in neurodegenerative diseases, where lower fractional anisotropy ( ), lower FC within the DMN ( ), and lower hippocampal volume ( ) were associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well. \n\nThe broad scope of this review allowed inclusion of a large variability in study populations, studied MRI markers, neuropsychological tests, and timing of MRI and neuropsychological testing, causing substantial heterogeneity across the included studies. Since neuroplasticity and recovery take place on the timescale of weeks or months after acute onset brain injury ( ,  ), time between onset and MRI or cognitive testing possibly confounded the associations and predictive values described in this review. This review comprised several studies that included the same patients and imaging modalities, which might have led to overestimation of some associations between MRI factors and cognitive outcome measures. However, our meta-analyses never included two studies based on the same data. \n\nA particular strength of this review is the inclusion of studies using neuropsychological tests with known psychometric quality and validity in the acute brain injury population only. We excluded new tests, screening tools, or tests mainly used in research settings. A limitation is that possibilities to perform meta-analyses were limited, because of heterogeneity of the included studies and selective reporting of results. Furthermore, studies eligible for meta-analysis all but two had small sample sizes (n\u00a0\u2264 40). Although missing data were requested, we may overestimate the pooled correlations in our meta-analyses. \n\nUltimately, we would want to be able to predict long-term cognitive impairments based on early screening of patients after acute onset brain injury. Based on the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, some major challenges remain. First, most studies were cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies are needed to be able to predict long-term cognitive outcome based on early screening. Our review shows that longitudinal studies on early MRI markers predictive for long-term cognition were scarce. Grouping and quantifying these results was not possible because no MRI marker was studied longitudinally more than once. International experts recommend early cognitive screening in order to provide cognitive rehabilitation therapy ( ,  ,  ). Second, the additional value of MRI, on top of other potential predictors, such as demographic or neuropsychological measures, has not been addressed. Research has mainly focused on finding group differences and correlations, without taking other possible predictors into account. Third, most studies looked into cognitive functioning instead of impairments. Finally, cut off values of the various proposed MRI markers for predicting impairments in the individual patient are lacking, and external validation of results has not been performed. Future research may focus on finding cut off values of early MRI markers for prediction of long-term cognitive impairments in individual patients and external validation of results. \n\nIn conclusion, hippocampal volume, fractional anisotropy in cingulum and fornix, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network are associated with (impairments of) memory, attention, and executive functioning after acute onset brain injury. For clinical implementation, more research is needed on early predictive values of these MRI markers, external validation of results, and cut off values for prediction of long-term cognitive impairments in individual patients. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 10165272, "text_md5": "df78ccc05204c0f9eabcdb59de453d35", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 128], "journal": [129, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 278], "keywords": [292, 421], "abstract": [434, 2515], "body": [2524, 31860]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 37119695, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103415", "pmcid": "10165272", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10165272", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10165272"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10165272\">10165272</a>", "list_title": "PMC10165272  MRI factors associated with cognitive functioning after acute onset brain injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Across fMRI and ERP studies, significant neuronal adaptations were found with exercise   cf  . control throughout the brain and were linked with improved global cognition, memory, and executive function. Cerebral blood flow was also found to improve with 24 weeks of exercise, but was not linked with cognitive changes. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe cognitive improvements associated with exercise are likely driven by increased metabolic activity, cerebrovascular mechanisms, and neuroplasticity throughout the brain. Our paper shows the promise in, and need for, high-quality trials integrating cognitive and brain function measures to elucidate the functional relationship between exercise and brain health in populations with a high risk of dementia. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \nPROSPERO, identifier: CRD42022291843. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nDementia is associated with a decline in cognition including memory, executive function, attention, language, thinking, and/or visuospatial skills that impacts functioning (Arvanitakis et al.,  ). As of 2020, ~55 million people have dementia worldwide, and this figure is expected to reach 152 million within the next 30 years (Martin et al.,  ). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, contributing to an estimated 50\u201375% of all cases (Gallaway et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough AD is frequently pathologically characterized by the accumulation of extracellular A\u03b2 plaques (Hardy and Higgins,  ), other proteinopathies are often present including neurofibrillary tangles of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, aggregates of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and \u03b1-synuclein pathology as seen in other causes of dementia (Josephs et al.,  ; DeTure and Dickson,  ). Further, cerebrovascular dysfunction and injury commonly occurs in AD, leading to \u201cmixed dementia\u201d, a combination of AD and vascular pathologies (Craft,  ; Govindpani et al.,  ). Together, this variable and multilayered pathology creates a neurotoxic environment associated with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cell death (Coles et al.,  ). Given the increasingly blurred line between the traditional aetiological types of dementia, interventions with multitargeted effects\u2014such as exercise\u2014that can transcend these diagnostic entities and reduce dementia risk should be prioritized. Importantly, approximately 40% of dementia risk is thought to be modifiable, providing opportunity for risk reduction strategies that may reduce dementia incidence and/or delay deterioration (Paulson and Igo,  ; Livingston et al.,  ). \n\nThe clinical syndrome for dementia occurs after a long-lasting asymptomatic preclinical phase followed by a symptomatic prodromal phase known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Jack et al.,  ; Sperling et al.,  ). MCI is characterized by objective cognitive decline on the background of relatively intact activities of daily living (Petersen et al.,  ). Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported worsening of cognition despite falling within the normal range of cognitive ability on neuropsychological tests (Molinuevo et al.,  ; van Harten et al.,  ; Jessen et al.,  ). Individuals with SCD and MCI have increased presence of AD biomarkers, cerebrovascular pathology, inflammatory burden (Blom et al.,  ; Shen et al.,  ), and an increased risk of developing dementia: ~2 fold for SCD and ~5 fold for MCI (Campbell et al.,  ; Perrotin et al.,  ; Pike et al.,  ). Vascular contributions to dementia risk, such as stroke and dysregulated cerebral blood flow, have also emerged as important markers for intervention efforts (Rundek et al.,  ). This makes the preclinical stages of dementia, including SCD, MCI, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), the ideal stages at which to intervene to try and prevent future cognitive decline, disability, and deterioration (Molinuevo et al.,  ; van Harten et al.,  ). \n\nPhysical activity including exercise is an important lifestyle factor that, when performed regularly, can decrease the risk of cognitive decline and dementia by 38% and 28%, respectively (Middleton et al.,  ; Sofi et al.,  ). Current guidelines, in Australia for example, suggest that older adults conduct physical activity of moderate intensity for 30 minutes on most, preferably all, days (Department of Health and Aged Care,  ). Problematically, only 28% of Australian adults aged over 65 years currently meet these guidelines (Australian Institute of Health Welfare,  ). It is well reported that exercise (aerobic, resistance or tai-chi) can improve cognition in older adults with and without cognitive decline (Snowden et al.,  ; Northey et al.,  ), particularly when combined with cognitive training (Cammisuli et al.,  ; Karssemeijer et al.,  ; Meng et al.,  ). Exercise is theorized to reduce cognitive deterioration risk through cerebrovascular improvements (Bliss et al.,  ), structural brain changes (Erickson et al.,  ; Bolandzadeh et al.,  ; ten Brink et al.,  ), and neural adaptations that stimulate neurogenesis and decrease cellular damage and pro-inflammatory responses (Vecchio et al.,  ). The functional brain changes associated with physical exercise in people experiencing cognitive decline that is associated with dementia risk are, however, less understood (Cui et al.,  ). \n\nFunctional brain measures can provide additional insights into the effects of exercise on the brain and cognitive function beyond that of structural brain measures (e.g., volumetric MRI; e.g., ten Brink et al.,  ), such as electrocortical (EEG, MEG, TMS), metabolic (PET, MRS), and cerebrovascular (fMRI, fNIRS, SPECT, ASL, TCD) activity (see  ; Steiner et al.,  ). Their application in exercise interventions in people with MCI has been growing, but with mixed effects being reported. For example, improvements in neuronal efficiency, as measured by fMRI, EEG, and PET, were identified in observational studies (Huang et al.,  ) while non-significant fMRI changes were found across RCTs (Ji et al.,  ). A systematic synthesis of RCTs is needed to understand the isolated effects of physical exercise on measures of cognition and brain function in people experiencing cognitive decline. \n  \nSearch strategy used to identify articles in EBSCOHost. \n  \nThe aim of this systematic review was to address the research question: \u201c  what are the study characteristics and effects of exercise interventions, on cognition and brain function in individuals with subjective or objective cognitive decline associated with dementia risk?\u201d   The findings from this review can further knowledge on the mechanisms by which physical activity interventions may exert previously reported positive effects on cognition and brain function in people with high dementia risk. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \nThis systematic review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022291843). The conduct and reporting of this systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). \n\n### 2.1. Eligibility criteria \n  \nTo formulate and refine the eligibility criteria and search strategy, a scoping review was performed. Existing literature was reviewed to identify the population, intervention, comparisons, outcome, and study design (PICOS) principles used in this systematic review. \n  \n Population:   Adults classified as having either subjective or objective cognitive impairment associated with dementia risk (e.g., SCD, MCI, VCI). \n  \n Intervention:   Any structured form of exercise (aerobic training, resistance/strength training, mind-body exercises that involve movement) as the primary focus of the study. \n  \n Comparisons:   A control group consisting of a wait-list group, usual care, or inactive/static exercise (e.g., stretching). \n  \n Outcomes:   Any validated assessment of cognition (e.g., Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE], Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) AND measure of brain function (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], electroencephalography [EEG], event-related potentials [ERPs], positron emission tomography [PET], functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]), cerebral blood flow [CBF], cerebral perfusion, transcranial Doppler [TCD], arterial spin labeling [ASL], magnetoencephalography [MEG], single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]). \n  \n Study designs:   Randomized controlled trial design of \u2265 4 weeks in duration to explore the effects of chronic exercise (Farrell and Turgeon,  ). \n  \nTo be eligible for inclusion, articles must have been peer-reviewed and published in English, without any limitation on publication year. Cognition and brain function assessments must have been conducted pre/post intervention. Cognitive measures were deemed valid based on whether an appropriate citation for the assessment tool was provided within the reported study (as assessed in the methodological quality checklist described in Section 2.5). Measures of brain function specifically related to neuroimaging and physiological measurement modalities that quantify the functional activity of the brain including fMRI, EEG, MEG, PET, SPECT, fNIRS, TMS, MRS, TCD, and ASL. Studies only reporting structural brain measures (e.g., volumetric MRI, diffusion weighted imaging) were excluded. If a study involved multiple groups of the same exercise type (e.g., resistance training once/week in group one and resistance training twice/week in group two), the protocol that most closely adhered to current physical activity guidelines (Bull et al.,  ) was assessed further. Studies were excluded if: a full text could not be obtained or they were published in a format other than a journal article (e.g., review, book chapter, opinion article, thesis or editorial). Studies that did not measure the isolated effects of exercise were excluded (e.g., multimodal studies and exergaming), as were studies which included people with comorbid neurological (e.g., Parkinson's disease) or psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression). \n\n\n### 2.2. Systematic search strategy \n  \nWe conducted a search for articles published in EBSCOHost (indexing CINAHL Plus, SportDiscus, PsycINFO, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Ageline), Web of Science (indexing Web of Science Core Collection, Current Contents Collection, Chinese Science Citation Database, KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index) from inception to 10 March 2023. Search terms included words related to our PICOS.   shows the advanced search strategy used in EBSCOHost, which was adapted for the other database. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study selection and data extraction \n  \nAll retrieved study titles and abstracts were imported into COVIDENCE. Following the removal of duplicates, titles and abstracts were independently screened by two researchers (RC and NJM) and full texts of potentially relevant studies were obtained. The full texts of relevant studies were reviewed independently by three researchers (AS, GZS, and DK); this included the review of reference lists for potentially relevant articles. Study characteristics were extracted from the included articles by two researchers (VU and AB). Any disagreement about the selection of studies, or extraction of data, was resolved by discussion with one researcher (DK). Authors were contacted for additional information where needed. The following data were extracted from the studies: first author, publication year, location, study population, study design, number of participants (intervention and controls), cognitive decline or impairment classification criteria (if any), age (mean and SD), percentage of females included, and intervention characteristics (type, frequency, intensity [if reported], session duration, intervention duration), pre/post-intervention cognitive outcome data (mean, SD), and summary of brain function findings (between- and within-group effects, and   p   values). Two researchers (DK and GZS) categorized domain-specific cognitive performance according to the Cattell-Horn-Carroll and Miyake framework (Webb et al.,  ), and consensus was reached with a third researcher (IHKL). \n\n\n### 2.4. Data synthesis \n  \nCognitive outcome data are presented as effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where data from \u22653 studies were available for a given cognitive domain, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3 software (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA). Significance was set at   p   < 0.05. Effect sizes were calculated from pre- to post-intervention scores between two groups for change in cognition outcomes such as global cognition, executive function, processing speed, and general short-term memory and expressed as Hedge's   g   with 95% CIs around the estimated effect size. Absolute between-study heterogeneity was calculated using tau (\u03c4). If post intervention scores were not available, the absolute or relative mean change scores were used to calculate effect sizes. Where there were two comparisons from the same study for a particular outcome (e.g., an aerobic exercise group and dancing group), the sample size of the control group was halved. \n\nStatistical heterogeneity between studies was quantified using Cochran's Q and   I   statistics, both of which provide estimates of the degree of heterogeneity resulting from between-study variance, rather than by chance. Cochran's Q with   p   < 0.05 was classified as significant heterogeneity, and   I   of more than 75% was considered to indicate high level heterogeneity,   I   of 25%\u221275% as indicative of substantial heterogeneity, and an   I   < 25% as low heterogeneity. Publication bias was tested using the Begg and Mazumdar test, with a   p   < 0.05 suggesting the presence of bias (Sterne et al.,  ). Where significant bias was detected, a Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill analysis (Duval and Tweedie,  ) was conducted to re-calculate the pooled effect size after removing any studies which may introduce publication bias (i.e., small studies with large effect sizes from the positive side of the funnel plot). Brain function effects were narratively analyzed due to heterogenous outcomes and insufficient data available for meta-analysis. \n\n\n### 2.5. Methodological quality \n  \nStudy quality was assessed independently by two researchers (TT and AB) using a modified Downs and Black checklist (Downs and Black,  ). Reporting quality is assessed with 10 items spanning the aims, participant characteristics, and findings; external validity is checked with 3 items concerning representativeness; internal validity for bias and confounding/selection bias with 4 and 6 items respectively. The scale was modified to include criteria on exercise supervision, whereby if a study was supervised, a \u201cyes\u201d was given. If an item was unable to be determined a \u201cno\u201d was given. Scores were compared and disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (AS). \n\n\n### 2.6. Risk of bias \n  \nStudies were assessed for bias independently by two reviewers (TT and RLC) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (Sterne et al.,  ). Included studies were evaluated as having \u2018low,' \u2018high,' or \u2018unclear' risk of bias using the following domains: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of intervention instructors, blinding of participants, blinding of outcome assessors, handling of incomplete data, selective reporting, and other risk of bias pertaining to exercise adherence. Discrepancies in ratings were discussed and resolved with one additional reviewer (AS). Studies were not excluded based on their bias assessment. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study selection \n  \n represents the study selection process for this review. A total of 5,204 records were identified with 4,477 remaining after duplicates were removed. Fifteen articles met eligibility criteria for this systematic review, representing 12 unique interventions. \n  \nFlow chart of the study selection process. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Study characteristics \n  \nThe characteristics of the fifteen articles are shown in  . There were three multi-paper interventions: two articles reported on different brain function outcomes from the one intervention (Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), two papers reported on the same intervention outcomes at different time-points (Suo et al.,   for intervention effects; Broadhouse et al.,   for follow-up), and two publications reported on different aspects of the same brain function measure from the one intervention (Tao et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). As we were interested in intervention effects here, the follow-up findings from Broadhouse et al. were excluded from further analysis, but are reported in   for interested readers. Further, as Lin et al. and Tao et al. referred to the same sample between their studies, only Tao et al.'s data was used in the meta-analysis. All articles were published between 2012 and 2023, with five studies located in China, two each in Canada and Australia, and one each in Israel, Pakistan, Taiwan, United States of America, and South Korea. Nine of the twelve unique interventions employed a two-group parallel arm design and the remaining four trials involved three groups where two exercise-related interventions were compared to a control. \n  \nStudy characteristics of the 15 identified exercise trials in people with cognitive impairment associated with increased dementia risk. \n  \nMulti-paper study reporting on different brain function measures from the same intervention.

Participant characteristics \n  \nA total of 646 participants with cognitive frailty, MCI, or VCI were included and their baseline characteristics are summarized in  . For multi-paper interventions, the number of participants from the main study (i.e., Suo et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ) was used in the calculation for total participants included in this review. There were no studies involving people classified with SCD. \n\nPopulation classification criteria varied between the studies with published guidelines being used in all but one trial (Zhu et al.,  ), and a MoCA or MMSE cut-off score being used in all but two studies (Xia et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). MoCA cut-off scores were consistently applied at \u2264 26 while the MMSE cut-off was inconsistently used: <25 (Amjad et al.,  ), >20 (Hsu et al.,  ), >24 (Suo et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ). Mean age ranged from 58 to 78 years, and female representation in samples ranged from 38.4 to 100%. \n\n\n### 3.4. Intervention characteristics \n  \nThe last two columns of   summarize the exercise intervention characteristics and outcome measures relevant to this review. Of the nine two-arm trials, six employed aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity (Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), two used a resistance training protocol (Suo et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ), and one implemented the mind-body exercise of Baduajin (Lin et al.,  ). In the three-arm trials, aerobic and resistance training protocols were used in two studies (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ), while aerobic and mind-body exercise regimes were employed in the other two studies (Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Most interventions were compared to usual care or lifestyle, while three employed sham exercise (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ), and a further four involved a concurrent treatment of health education across all groups (Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Exercise frequency ranged from 2 to 3 sessions per week and intervention duration ranged from 6 to 24 weeks, with the most common being 24 weeks. \n\nSupervision was employed in all aerobic exercise trials, and this was conducted through walking (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ), dancing (Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), or on a treadmill or stationary bicycle (Amjad et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ) for a duration of 20\u201360 minutes. Intensity varied between 60\u201390% of max HR (Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ) or 50\u201380% of HR reserve (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Resistance training protocols prescribed exercises at an intensity >65%1RM and adhered to the principles of progressive overload using an elastic band for 40 min (Hong et al.,  ) or a machine and free weights for 40\u201390 min (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). Three interventions employed the mind-body exercise of Baduanjin for 60 min, three times per week (Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Seven trials reported warm-up and cool-down periods lasting 5\u201310 min (Hong et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). \n\n\n### 3.5. Cognitive outcome measures and effects \n  \nAs shown in  , four cognitive domains were assessed across the included studies: global cognition (as measured by the MoCA, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog), executive function (most commonly assessed using Trail Making Test B), processing speed (most commonly measured with the Trail Making Test A), and general short-term memory (assessed with Digit Span measures). The pooled effects of exercise vs control groups for these cognitive outcomes are summarized in  . \n  \nDomain-specific cognitive performance outcomes of exercise and control groups from included trials. \n  \nAE, Aerobic Exercise; BDJ, Baduanjin; IRT, Incongruent trial Reaction Time; K-MoCA, Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment; N/A, Not Available; RT, Resistance Training; TMT-A, Trail Making Test A; TMT-B, Trail Making Test B. \n    \nForest plot depicting effect of exercise versus control on global cognition, executive function, processing speed, and general short-term memory. \n  \n#### 3.5.1. Global cognition \n  \nEleven studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in global cognition (Suo et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium and significant improvement in global cognition (g = \u22120.417, 95% CI, \u22120.694 to \u22120.140,   p   = 0.003,   I   = 43.56%, \u03c4 =0.369, n =488). There was no indication of publication bias (p = 0.246). \n\n\n#### 3.5.2. Executive function \n  \nSix studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in executive function (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium and significant improvement in executive function (g = \u22120.391, 95% CI, \u22120.651to \u22120.131,   p   = 0.003,   I   = 13.28%, \u03c4 =0.185, n =273). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n#### 3.5.3. Processing speed \n  \nFour studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs control for change in processing speed (Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium but non-significant change in processing speed (g = \u22120.445, 95% CI, \u22120.929 to 0.040,   p   = 0.072,   I   = 64.11%, \u03c4 =0.441,   n   =198). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n#### 3.5.4. General short-term memory \n  \nFour studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in short-term memory performance (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium but non-significant improvement in short-term memory function (g = \u22120.412, 95% CI, \u22120.734 to 0.090,   p   = 0.012,   I   = 10.01%, \u03c4 =0.118,   n   =173). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n\n### 3.6. Brain function \n  \n#### 3.6.1. fMRI \n  \nEight fMRI studies were identified, with three studies each assessing hemodynamic activity during cognitive tasks: associative memory (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), complex information processing (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), and flanker tasks (Hsu et al.,  ), and the other five utilizing an eyes closed resting state (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). \n\nIn an associative memory task (Nagamatsu et al.,  ), 6-months resistance training altered hemodynamic activity in the right lingual gyrus (  p   = 0.03), occipital-fusiform gyrus (  p   = 0.02), and right frontal pole (  p   = 0.03) during the encoding and recall of associations, when compared with the control group (direction of effects not reported). Hemodynamic changes in the right lingual gyrus correlated positively with memory performance (  r   = 0.51,   p   = 0.02); while aerobic training effects were comparable to the control group (Nagamatsu et al.,  ). During the encoding phase of another associative memory task, 16-weeks aerobic exercise increased BOLD activity in frontal regions including left inferior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.001), left precentral gyrus (  p   =0.001), and left middle frontal gyrus (  p   =0.044) in people with amnestic MCI (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). There was also aerobic exercise-related enhanced response synchronization in the supramarginal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, insular cortices, anterior cingulate, precuneus and cuneus in their complex information processing paradigm (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). In the flanker task (Hsu et al.,  ), 6-months aerobic training reduced activity in the left lateral occipital cortex (  p   < 0.03) and the right superior temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.03), relative to the control group. These reductions were significantly associated with faster reaction times on congruent trials (both   p   = 0.04). The decrease in superior temporal gyrus activity also correlated with better performance on incongruent trials (  p   = 0.05) (Hsu et al.,  ). \n\nOf the five resting state studies, one reported significant between-groups effects (Xia et al.,  ), with 24-weeks Baduanjin reducing functional connectivity in the right supramarginal inferior parietal and angular gyri, right rolandic operculum, right precuneus, and right fusiform gyrus when compared with the control group (all   p   < 0.05). Both exercise groups (Baduanjin and brisk walking) led to reduced functional connectivity in the right middle temporal gyrus relative to controls (all   p   \u2264 0.042). However, these functional connectivity changes were not associated with Stroop task performance (all   p   > 0.05). Another Baduanjin intervention study (Liu et al.,  ) assessing people with MCI found that 6-months training increased resting state functional connectivity from the right locus coeruleus and left ventral tegmental area to the right insula, right amygdala, and right anterior cingulate. The increased connectivity between the right locus coeruleus, the right insula (  r   =0.277,   p   =0.037), and the right anterior cingulate (  r   =0.265,   p   =0.046) were correlated with global cognitive performance (MoCA) (Liu et al.,  ). Progressive resistance training (Suo et al.,  ) for 6-months in people with MCI decreased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and both the left inferior temporal lobe and anterior cingulate cortex, and between the bilateral hippocampi and the right inferior temporal lobe (all   p   < 0.001). Functional connectivity was increased between the bilateral hippocampi and right middle frontal lobe (  p   =0.001). These changes in functional connectivity were not associated with the improvements in cognition observed with the resistance training intervention (Suo et al.,  ). \n\nWithin-group analyses in another study (Qi et al.,  ) showed that 3-months aerobic exercise increased the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in bilateral fronto-temporal, entorhinal, anterior cingulate and parahippocampal cortices (all   p   < 0.05); whereas controls exhibited increased ALFF in the right temporal and posterior cingulate cortex (  p   < 0.05). These changes in ALFF were not related to cognitive test performance. Another sub-study (Tao et al.,  ) from the trial assessing 24-weeks Baduanjin training in people with cognitive frailty found that Baduanjin training led to significant ALFF reductions in the right hippocampus (classic low-frequency band 0.01\u20130.08 Hz) and increases in the bilateral anterior cingulate (slow-5 band 0.010\u20130.027 Hz); these were linked with MoCA score changes (hippocampus:   r   = \u22120.291,   p   =0.036; anterior cingulate:   r   =0.309,   p   =0.025). \n\n\n#### 3.6.2. Electrophysiology \n  \nFour studies examined electrophysiological activity (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). There were two EEG studies identified, with neuronal activity assessed in the delta to beta band ranges during alternating eyes closed and open states in one study (Amjad et al.,  ) and eyes closed in the second study (Hong et al.,  ). Relative eyes closed resting state power in delta and alpha-2 were lower, beta-1 was higher, and EEG complexity (approximate entropy) increased after 6-weeks (18 sessions) aerobic exercise compared with controls (all   p   < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the eyes-open condition (Amjad et al.,  ). In the second study, relative theta power in the frontal-left region decreased, while relative alpha power in the temporal-left region increased with 12-weeks resistance training as compared to the control group (both   p   < 0.05) (Hong et al.,  ). \n\nTwo ERP studies were found (Zhu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). In the one auditory task ERP study of people with MCI (task details not described; Zhu et al.,  ) that assessed P300 component amplitudes and latencies, 3-months of aerobic exercise (dancing) reduced P300 component latency relative to controls, and this effect was sustained at the 6-month follow-up (both   p   < 0.05). In the second ERP study (Tsai et al.,  ), 16-weeks exercise in people with amnestic MCI increased P3 amplitudes from a visual task switching paradigm following both aerobic (  p   < 0.001) and resistance training (  p   = 0.013) compared to controls. \n\n\n#### 3.6.3. Cerebral blood flow \n  \nTwo studies assessed cerebral blood flow (Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Tomoto et al. ( ) measured cerebral blood flow with transcranial doppler in people with MCI. Following 12-months aerobic exercise training, internal carotid arterial flow (  p   = 0.023) and normalized cerebral blood flow (  p   = 0.006) increased, and in the middle cerebral artery, diastolic cerebral blood flow velocity (  p   = 0.020) increased, and pulsatility index deceased (  p   =0.030). These changes were not associated with cognitive performance (Tomoto et al.,  ). \n\nThe 24-week trial of Baduanjin in people with cognitive frailty (Lin et al.,  ) led to increased blood flow velocity in the right middle cerebral artery and basilar artery, and increased end diastolic velocity to the basilar artery; with a decrease reported for the control group (all   p   < 0.023). Reductions in peak systolic velocity in the bilateral middle cerebral artery were observed for both Baduanjin training and the control group (all   p   < 0.045); these were lower for controls. Correlations with cognitive function were not explored (Lin et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### 3.7. Methodological quality \n  \nThe results of the methodological quality assessment are presented in  . The scores ranged from 13\u201320, with an average of 16.9. Seven studies were classified as being of moderate quality (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), and one was considered to be of high quality (Hsu et al.,  ). All studies did not blind their intervention groups due to the nature of the exercise trials. Most articles (  n   = 11) adequately reported their aims, outcomes, patient characteristics, interventions,   p  -values, and variabilities. \n  \nResults of the modified methodological quality assessment (Downs and Black,  ). \n    \nSix trials reported the adherence to exercise sessions, with an average adherence rate of \u226554% (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Furthermore, all included trials provided supervised exercise sessions. Three studies reported adverse effects, which included acute episodes of shortness of breath and non-injurious falls in one study (Nagamatsu et al.,  ), and no adverse effects in the other studies (Zhu et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Seven studies reported attempted to blind those measuring cognitive outcomes of the exercise interventions (Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). \n\n\n### 3.8. Risk of bias \n  \nThe results of the risk of bias assessment are summarized in  . Five studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on six or more domains (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Two studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on five domains (Qi et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), while six studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on four or less domains (Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). \n  \nRisk of bias assessment summary. \n  \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate exercise interventions for effects on cognition and brain function in adults with cognitive impairment. As evidenced by our screening outcomes (see  ), this literature base was rather limited and is considerably novel, with fifteen articles identified and thirteen of these being published within the last 4 years (since 2018). All but two studies included people with MCI (Hsu et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ) and all but one referred to published guidelines in their classification criteria (Nagamatsu et al.,  ). No studies involving people with SCD met eligibility criteria. Intervention protocols mostly involved moderate intensity aerobic exercise and were conducted 2\u20133 times per week for up to 40 MIN per session. Most studies assessed global cognition using the MoCA and executive functions through the Trail Making Test B, with most brain function assessments conducted using fMRI. \n\n### 4.1. Exercise and cognition \n  \nAccording to our analyses, exercise leads to moderate and significant improvements in global cognitive and executive functions, and these are driven by interventions of aerobic nature. The cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise (high- and low-frequency) have been reported in previous meta-analyses and reviews extending to those who have AD and non-AD dementias, MCI, and SCD (Baker et al.,  ; Groot et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ; Cammisuli et al.,  ). Studies utilizing strength-based exercise for cognition in older adults, however, are lacking. Only four studies included in this meta-analysis employed resistance strength-based training. Further, none of the studies explored the effects of resistance training on processing speed. Reduced muscular strength has been associated with advancing age (Lauretani et al.,  ), greater brain atrophy, white matter disease, and poorer cognitive function (Clark and Taylor,  ; Kilgour et al.,  ; Herold et al.,  ). \n\nGrowing evidence shows that resistance exercise evokes meaningful benefits in functional brain changes (particularly the frontal lobe), reductions in white matter lesions and decreased atrophy across age-groups (Herold et al.,  ). For example, in older sedentary males, a 6-month study presented that resistance training improved memory performance (Cassilhas et al.,  ). In community-dwelling older women, progressive resistance exercise significantly improved executive function by up to 12.6% (Liu-Ambrose et al.,  ). Further, at 2-year follow-up within that same cohort, both bi-weekly and weekly resistance exercise increased peak muscle power, maintained executive functions, promoted memory, and reduced white matter atrophy (Best et al.,  ). \n\nIn an MCI population that compared progressive resistance training (PRT) with computerized cognitive training (CCT), the authors found that the PRT but not CCT significantly increased gray matter in the posterior cingulate, reduced white matter hyperintensity, and improved global cognition at 6-months follow-up (Suo et al.,  ). From our analyses, pooled effects for short-term memory were moderate, but non-significant. However, these marginal improvements in short-term memory seem to be driven by resistance training, rather than aerobic exercises, which has not been reported elsewhere. Together, this suggests that resistance exercise has cognitive benefits independent of aerobic exercise. Previous research has demonstrated plausible biological mechanisms involving homocysteine and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Liu-Ambrose and Donaldson,  ). As an interesting aside, it has been claimed by an older meta-analysis that the greatest benefits on cognition in older adults could occur when aerobic exercise was combined with resistance training (Colcombe and Kramer,  ). Regardless, more clinical trials examining the role of resistance strength-based exercise independently or combined with aerobic exercises are required to explore the maximal benefits on cognitive functions and associated physiological changes. \n\n\n### 4.2. Exercise and brain function \n  \nRegional differences throughout the brain were reported across studies utilizing fMRI to assess central mechanisms of exercise, with few commonalities (in study design and subsequently results), making synthesis of results challenging. Task-based fMRI assessments revealed exercise-related changes in distinct brain areas, with two of the three studies respectively correlating right lingual gyrus and superior temporal gyrus changes with improved cognitive performance (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ). The most pronounced resting state changes observed were in the temporal lobes, with 12\u201326 weeks of aerobic, resistance, and mind-body exercises altering the hippocampal region (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ). While most studies found non-significant correlations between the regional changes in brain activity and cognitive performance (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ), improved MoCA scores were associated with Baduanjin-related changes in resting state anterior cingulate activity (Tao et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). These findings are likely due to increased regional metabolic activity (Shimada et al.,  ) and may reflect exercise-induced neuroplastic changes as observed in other populations (Woodward et al.,  ), potentially providing a buffer against pathophysiological and age-related atrophy (Bugg and Head,  ) in these vulnerable regions. \n\nIn AD, the resting state EEG signature is dominated by slow wave activity (i.e., increased delta and theta magnitude) and reduced fast wave activity (alpha and beta magnitude) (Babiloni et al.,  ), and a similar pattern has been reported in MCI (Meghdadi et al.,  ) (albeit less consistently), particularly those who have an increased risk of AD (Jelic et al.,  ). However, in healthy aging, the opposite is observed, that is, reduced delta and theta spectral power (Vlahou et al.,  ; Barry and De Blasio,  ). Across included studies, 12\u201316 weeks of exercise (both aerobic and resistance) led to reduced delta and theta power in MCI (Hong et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ), potentially indicating a normalization of the EEG spectra and a shift away from the AD trajectory. Exercise differentially modulated alpha, with aerobic training reducing alpha-2 power (11\u201314 Hz) (Amjad et al.,  ) and resistance training increasing broad-band alpha (8\u201312 Hz) power (Hong et al.,  ). Hong's finding may have more therapeutic relevance here given that reduced alpha power (and peak frequency) is reported in MCI/AD, and the wider alpha range may have detected this. Further, aerobic exercise appears to promote neural adaptability that is measurable at a global scale. Aerobic exercise increased EEG complexity (Amjad et al.,  ), a signal proposed to reflect the underlying integrity of neuronal circuitry and its capacity to rapidly adapt to environmental changes (Bosl et al.,  ). This is further reflected in the ERP effects of aerobic and resistance exercise whereby reduced P300 latency and increased P300 amplitude indicated faster stimulus evaluation processing and enhanced neurocognitive efficiency (Steiner et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). \n\nIncreased CBF has been suggested as a potential mechanism underpinning the positive effects of exercise on cognitive function (Renke et al.,  ). The exact reason for this is less clear but these effects may arise from the association between neuronal metabolism and CBF and perfusion (i.e., neurovascular coupling), changes in cerebral blood vessels including elasticity and density (i.e., angiogenesis), and enhanced activity of pericytes (Bolduc et al.,  ; Barnes et al.,  ). From the two CBF studies identified in this review, aerobic exercise was found to increase blood flow velocity in the internal carotid artery (Tomoto et al.,  ), right middle cerebral and basilar arteries (Lin et al.,  ), and end diastolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Tomoto et al.,  ) and basilar artery (Lin et al.,  ). In the middle cerebral artery, reductions were also seen in pulsatility (Tomoto et al.,  ) and peak systolic velocity (Lin et al.,  ). No associations were found with cognitive function were found in the one study that assessed for them (Tomoto et al.,  ) so we are currently unable to infer whether these changes in arterial CBF are associated with cognitive improvements related to exercise. \n\n\n### 4.3. Limitations \n  \nA small number of studies met eligibility criteria pertaining to intervention characteristics and outcome measures, limiting the implications of this review. Most notably, there were no SCD studies. This is unsurprising given that classification criteria were operationalized in 2017 (Molinuevo et al.,  ), just as brain function measures emerged as outcomes of interest in exercise trials. This limited the scope of our review, its findings, and implications to objective classifications of cognitive impairment, which are respectively considered to represent the prodromal stages of AD and vascular dementia. These findings were also hindered by the small sample sizes, lack of reported adherence to exercise sessions (and where this was reported in two studies, the average adherence rate was 75%), moderate methodological quality, and high risk of bias in most included studies. We also did not exclude studies based on intervention from any pooled analysis. The pooled analyses were undertaken to determine the effect of exercise per se (which can include aerobic exercise or resistance training), to maximize the sample size. Further studies can explore the relative effects of individual exercise prescription variables such as modality, intensity, and volume. These review outcomes speak to the paucity and novelty of brain function research regarding exercise for dementia prevention. Any neuronal mechanistic inferences regarding exercise and cognition are thus speculative. \n\n\n### 4.4. Conclusion \n  \nAs reviewed here, exercise can significantly improve global cognitive and executive functions in people with cognitive impairment and increased dementia risk. Regardless of modality (aerobic, resistance, or mind-body), at least 12 weeks of exercise can reverse brain activity signatures of cognitive decline in people with cognitive impairment. We speculate that the cognitive improvements associated with exercise are likely driven by increased metabolic activity, cerebrovascular mechanisms (such as neurovascular coupling), and neuroplasticity throughout the brain, but particularly in highly sensitive and plastic regions in the frontal and temporal lobes. These hypotheses require further investigation with higher quality randomized controlled trials.   integrates these central impacts of exercise alongside other functional changes together with molecular and physiological mechanisms established in prior reviews (mentioned in the introduction), highlighting the multitargeting effects of exercise for dementia risk reduction. As the field of dementia prevention grows, we encourage researchers to include more clinical trials investigating the role of resistance strength-based exercise independently or combined with aerobic exercises in this at-risk population. This is to identify the maximal benefits of different exercise regimes on cognition and physiological changes. Furthermore, as highlighted here, future research should integrate both cognitive and brain function measures to help elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the positive effects of exercise. \n  \nPositive effects of aerobic, resistance and mind-body exercise on functional (body and brain), physiological and molecular mechanisms that may reduce dementia risk. \n  \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nDK, AS, and GS-L conceptualized the study.

ABERRANT TIMING AND SALIENCE NETWORK IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: FINDINGS FROM A META-ANALYSIS\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) affects several domains of cognitive function. Abnormal time and novelty processing, which is related to change detection, has been reported in this disorder. Timing and oddball tasks can be used to assess change detection in perceptual processes. We hypothesize that an impaired timing network underlies disruptive cognitive functioning in SZ, such as saliency detection. Therefore, timing dysfunction might be a primary cognitive deficit in this disorder. \n\nTo address this issue, our aim was to elucidate the neural areas underlying target detection and timing in SZ, as well as to determine whether the timing dysfunctional activity pattern showed by SZ patients matches the pattern involved in attention salience processing. The final purpose of our study was to identify the brain structures activated during both timing and oddball tasks in patients with SZ, as compared to healthy controls (HC). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted two independent comprehensive literature searches of whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that compared patients with SZ and HC using oddball and timing tasks. The searches were conducted with PubMed engine up to November 2017. Keywords used in the first search were: \u201cschizophrenia\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d plus \u201ctiming\u201d or \u201ctime perception\u201d or \u201ctime estimation\u201d. In the second search keywords used were: \u201cschizophrenia\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d plus \u201cevent-related\u201d, plus \u201coddball\u201d. \n\nWe excluded studies that 1) used a region-of-interest approach; 2) did not report peak coordinates for the relevant contrast; 3) used different statistical thresholds in different regions of the brain; 4) used techniques other than fMRI; 5) were based on Independent Component Analysis; 6) were case reports, qualitative studies, reviews or meta-analyses. \n\nWe ran two independent signed differential mapping (SDM) meta-analyses of fMRI studies conducting comparisons between HC and patients with SZ: one reporting brain activation patterns during an oddball task, and a second one using timing tasks. We carried out a final multimodal meta-analysis to combine the findings from the two previous SDM meta-analyses. The aim of this multimodal analysis was to detect brain regions that are activated or deactivated by both timing and oddball tasks in SZ. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur initial search returned 173 papers, but application of inclusion criteria reduced this number to 8. Among them, 3 studied timing (which included a total of 53 SZ patients and 60 HC) and 5 examined oddball paradigm (which included a total of 100 SZ patients and 122 HC). \n\nRelative to HC, patients with SZ showed significantly hypoactivation in right striatum, right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9 and 45), and right median cingulate / paracingulate gyri (BA 32) during timing tasks. For oddball tasks, even if they showed significantly decreased activation in right inferior parietal gyri (BA 40) and corpus callosum, they also exhibited hyperactivation or failure of deactivation in left superior frontal gyrus, and dorsolateral (BA 9). Finally, overlapping was found in regions that were hypoactivated and hyperactivated by oddball tasks in SZ patients relative to HC. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results show that there is a common dysfunctional participation of frontal, cingulate, striatum, and parietal regions in SZ during both timing and oddball tasks. These findings suggest that a deficient timing network underlies attentional salience. However, these results are preliminary and further studies may be conducted to address the specific role of timing on cognition. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"id": 5887562, "text_md5": "6f653d8541d9ee3ccd2d519180a48257", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 95], "journal": [96, 110], "publication_year": [112, 116], "title": [127, 216], "keywords": [230, 230], "abstract": [243, 3941], "body": [3950, 3950]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sby018.858", "pmcid": "5887562", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5887562", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5887562"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5887562\">5887562</a>", "list_title": "PMC5887562  S71.

To reduce the economic and health toll of the disease, insight into its pathophysiological mechanism is key to improving treatment and prevention. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies suggest abnormal functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) in migraine patients. This implies that DMN connectivity change may represent a biomarker for migraine. However, the FC abnormalities appear inconsistent which hinders our understanding of the potential neuropathology. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the FC within the DMN in migraine patients in the resting state to identify the common FC abnormalities. With efficient search and selection strategies, nine studies (published before July, 2022) were retrieved, containing 204 migraine patients and 199 healthy subjects. We meta-analyzed the data using the Anisotropic Effect Size version of Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM) method. Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients showed increased connectivity in the right calcarine gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right cerebellum, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right posterior cingulate gyrus, while decreased connectivity in the right postcentral gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, right orbital inferior frontal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. These results provide a new perspective for the study of the pathophysiology of migraine and facilitate a more targeted treatment of migraine in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMigraine is the commonest primary headache in clinical practice. This disabling neurological disorder is characterized by recurrent unilateral or bilateral pulsating headaches ( ). Epidemiological surveys showed that 1.1 billion people suffer from migraine worldwide which constitutes the second leading cause of disability globally ( ;  ). Unfortunately, the surveys also illustrated an upward trend in the incidence of migraine attacks ( ;  ). Given that the disabling effect of the disease foists colossal socio-economic and health costs on its sufferers ( ), scholars found the lack of progress in diagnosis and treatment over the years lamentable ( ;  ;  ). We contend that the stagnation in scientific breakthroughs in this area is mainly due to the lack of insight into the disease\u2019s pathophysiology. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)\u2014a non-invasive method, has been widely used in brain functional research ( ;  ). This method has contributed to the understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism of migraine greatly ( ;  ;  ;  ). Previous rs-fMRI studies demonstrated the close relationship between both the default mode network (DMN) and its associated brain regions and migraine ( ;  ;  ). The DMN is a highly active brain network when the brain is at rest and is associated with an individual\u2019s stressful experiences and his/her coping strategies that promote adaptation to the (stressful) environment ( ;  ). \n\nA growing body of evidences have revealed the role of non-adaptive responses in migraine mechanisms ( ;  ). These suggested that recurrent migraine attacks alter the functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN and that these changes may disrupt individual stress response mechanisms ( ). Extant studies showed that abnormal FC of DMN has been found in patients with different pain disorders, suggesting that pain has a broad impact on the DMN ( ;  ). In addition, DMN was involved in the pain inhibition process and affected the efficiency of pain processing ( ;  ;  ). The above studies indicate the critical role DMN plays in the neuropathological mechanisms of migraine. So, a fine understanding of DMN may facilitate workable treatment options. \n\nThe identification of spatial patterns of DMN in migraine patients can be based on FC. That is because the FC is capable of exploring the connectivity between brain regions and depicting the complex functional coupling patterns between various brain regions ( ), and has been applied in exploring FC abnormalities in patients ( ). Currently, many scholars have used seed-based FC analysis ( ;  ) and independent component analysis ( ;  ;  ) to explore FC abnormalities within the DMN of migraine patients. However, the inconsistent results of the resting-state FC (rs-FC) within the DMN in migraine patients must not be ignored. Some studies identified decreased rs-FC of the DMN in migraine patients compared to healthy subjects. Decreased functional connectivity was found in the right cerebellum and left frontal lobe in   study,   found decreased connectivity in the prefrontal and temporal regions of the DMN,   found reduced connectivity in the left precuneus of the DMN while others detected increased rs-FC in the DMN,   observed increased DMN FC in the left precentral gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and right cerebellum,   only found increased FC in the left precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex within the DMN. Those discrepant findings may be due to small sample size, patients\u2019 clinical heterogeneity, and the different sample selections ( ). Fortunately, meta-analysis can synthesize neuroimaging findings to reduce the discrepant results ( ). Specifically, the method can aggregate and integrate a large amount of data from studies and distinguish positive results in the process of replication ( ). With the increasing number of published studies about FC in the DMN during the resting state of migraine patients, conducting a meta-analysis to identify common functional abnormalities in the brain is urgently needed to further deepen our understanding of migraine\u2019s pathophysiological mechanisms. \n\nAccordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to assess common alterations in the connectivity of DMN in migraine patients by using the Anisotropic Effect Size version of Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM ( ). Our findings could help harmonize the contradictory results found in the literature and advance the understanding of migraine. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Search strategy and literature screening \n  \nMethods and analyses of the current study were pre-registered on the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022348891).  This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Rigorous Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( ). We searched comprehensively in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for literature up to July 2022, using the combined keywords: (\u201cmigraine\u201d) AND (\u201cresting state\u201d OR \u201crest\u201d) AND (\u201cDMN\u201d OR \u201cdefault mode network\u201d). Further, we searched the reference list of the qualified literature compiled by our manual search from related reviews and references. For studies that did not provide detailed information in the paper (e.g., peak effect coordinates), we contacted the authors by email to obtain relevant information. \n\nFor literature selection, we used the following inclusion criteria: (i) original rs-fMRI study written in English; ( ) patients included in the study meet the diagnostic criteria for migraine; (iii) used seed-based or ICA methods to conduct rs-fMRI data analysis; (iv) direct comparison of rs-FC between migraine patients and healthy subjects; (v) peak coordinates of between-group effects were reported in a standard space, such as Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Studies were excluded if (i) it is a book chapter or review article; ( ) the coordinates of significant statistical differences in rs-FC between groups could not be retrieved even by contacting the author; (iii) the sample in the study overlapped with another published study; and (iv) the seeds were not selected in DMN. According to the above inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible articles were screened and included in this meta-analysis. The literature search and screening were conducted by two investigators independently (S.H and JJ.W) and the relevant studies were double-checked by the two investigators (S.H and JJ.W). Inconsistent studies were discussed and resolved   via   consensus. \n\n\n### 2.2. Quality assessment and data extraction \n  \nTo ensure high data quality, we assessed each included study using a 20-point checklist ( ;  ), which was adapted from previous rs-fMRI meta-analyses. The checklist mainly contains an assessment of the quality of subjects (e.g., demographic and clinical characteristics) and the study methodology (e.g., image procedure, method description), the details of the checklist are presented in  . After quality assessment, important information from each included study was extracted and collated, mainly including the first author, migraine type, sample size, sex ratio, age distribution, disease duration, disease frequency analytical method, seed region, scanner type, and statistical threshold. Furthermore, the current meta-analysis was based on peak coordinates showing the regions of significant differences in rs-FC between-group, therefore, the peak coordinates and their effect values (e.g.,   T  -values or   Z  -scores) of each research were also obtained and sorted into a corresponding text file. \n\n\n### 2.3. Main meta-analysis \n  \nAn anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based   d   mapping (AES-SDM) software package version 5.15 for Windows  was used in the current meta-analysis. SDM is a powerful statistical technique that uses peak coordinates to perform meta-analyses to assess differences in brain activity and has been widely used in recent neuroimaging meta-analyses ( ;  ;  ). Following the guidance of the AES-SDM tutorial, this meta-analysis was completed in three parts. In the first step, we retrieved the peak coordinates and their corresponding effect size from the results reported by each study. It is worth noting that all   Z  -scores were transformed into   T  -value using the SDM online converter. If the effect size was not specified in the study, we will use \u201cp\u201d for hyper-connectivity and \u201cn\u201d for hypo-connectivity to represent the effect size of these peak coordinates. The peak coordinates and effect values were then saved into a text file. After the data preparation, we preprocessed the datasets and reconstructed a mean effect-size map of differences between groups for each study using an anisotropic unnormalized Gaussian kernel ( ). In the last step, individual maps from each study were combined using meta-analytic calculations, which were weighted by intra-study variance and inter-study heterogeneity. We then calculated the mean of the study maps with a random-effects model ( ;  ). Here we adopted the recommended SDM parameters in the main meta-analysis, setting full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to 20 mm, uncorrected voxel   p   = 0.005, anisotropy = 1, peak height SDM-Z > 1, and cluster extent \u226510 voxels ( ;  ). \n\n\n### 2.4. Subgroup analysis \n  \nIn the current study, four types of subgroup analyses were performed. (1) subgroup analyses of migraineurs (MIG) and migraineurs without aura (MowA) to investigate the effect of disease type on FC abnormalities; (2) The five ICA studies were selected as a subgroup and the four studies based on seed-based FC as an additional subgroup to explore the alteration of FC in both methods. (3) To explore the effect of age, a subgroup analysis was performed on adults (eight studies). (4) To control for medication status, we conducted subgroup analyses of whether medication was taken. \n\n\n### 2.5. Analyses of sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias \n  \nA systematic Jackknife sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness and reliability of the main results. In short, Jackknife sensitivity analysis consists of repeated analyses, discarding one study at a time, for assessing the reproduction of the results ( ). In this analysis, we used the \u201cleave-one-out cross-validation\u201d (LOOCV) method to verify the repeatability of the results ( ). To be specific, the main analysis was repeated n times (  n   = the number of total studies), while discarding a different study each time. If the significant brain areas obtained after each LOOCV analysis were present in all or most of the previous significant brain regions, this result is then considered stable and reproducible ( ). Similarly, we applied the default SDM kernel size and thresholds to obtain the heterogeneous brain regions ( ), identifying brain areas that were not explained by differences between studies by using random effects models and Q test, H test, I-square sta  t  istics ( ;  ). Heterogeneity in the present study was evaluated by converting Q-statistics to Z-scores. Clusters showing significant heterogeneity and overlapped with the primary outcome were considered to be between-study heterogeneity ( ;  ). The heterogeneous brain regions obtained cannot be interpreted simply from the cause of the disease; it may result from clinical differences or demographic information of the patients, so the interpretation of the heterogeneous brain regions needs to be done with caution. Specifically, the results were thresholded using FWHM = 20 mm, uncorrected   p   = 0.005, peak height   Z   > 1, and cluster extent \u226510 voxels ( ;  ). In addition, funnel plots and Egger\u2019s test in SDM were conducted to calculate the probability of publication bias. Publication bias is the tendency for statistically significant findings (positive results) to be reported and published more frequently than non-significant findings (negative results) or invalid findings ( ). And the Egger\u2019s test was conducted by extracting values from the peak coordinates of abnormal brain regions in the main meta-analysis results ( ). Specifically, we first created a mask that using the peak coordinate from the main meta-analysis results, and then extracted value within mask. A result of   p   < 0.05 in Egger\u2019s test was considered to reflect significant publication bias ( ;  ). \n\n\n### 2.6. Meta-regression analysis \n  \nThe meta-regression analysis was conducted to examine the potential effects of the relevant variables on the FC alteration, in which the main variables involved were mainly age, disease duration, and frequency of attack. For the reduction of spurious relations, the significance level was set at   p   < 0.0005 as well as an extent threshold of 100 voxels ( ). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nFollowing strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we found nine studies that met our requirements and consisted of 204 migraine patients and 199 healthy individuals. The flow chart for the search and selection strategies are shown in  . One of the studies didn\u2019t report the sex ratio and another did not report age distribution. In the nine included studies, patients in three studies with medication status. In   study, the majority of migraine took prophylactic medication, whereas over a third of migraine took abortive medications in   study, patients took simple analgesics, simple triptans, and combination analgesics during a migraine attack; in   study, patients were taking flunarizine and ginkgolide for migraine prevention at the time of MRI. All the studies were acquired using a 3.0 T MRI scanner. There are five studies for ICA analysis and four studies for seed-based rs-FC analysis. The detailed sample characteristics and methodological details of included studies are summarized in  . \n  \nFlow diagram for the identification and exclusion of studies.

Main meta-analysis of rs-FC between migraine and HCs \n  \nCompared with the HCs, we found migraine patients to show significantly increased rs-FC, including right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), left inferior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Inf_L), left postcentral gyrus (Postcentral_L), right cerebellum (lobule IV/V, Cerebelum_4_5_R), right parahippocampal gyrus (ParaHippocampal_R), and right posterior cingulate gyrus (Cingulum_Post_R). Meanwhile, decreased rs-FC were discovered in the right postcentral gyrus (Postcentral_R), left superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_L), right superior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Sup_R), right orbital inferior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Inf_Orb_R), left middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_L), left middle frontal gyrus (Frontal_Mid_L), and left inferior frontal gyrus triangular part (Frontal_Inf_Tri_L). The detailed results from the meta-analysis are summarized in  ,  . \n  \nThe areas of increased (red) and decreased (blue) functional connectivity (FC) in the main meta-analysis. \u201cR\u201d and \u201cL\u201d denote the right and left sides of the brain, respectively.

Subgroup meta-analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses of ICA studies suggested that decreased FC was still found in the Occipital_Mid_L, Frontal_Sup_L and we also found decreased FC in the Calcarine_R in patients compared with healthy subjects. While the increased FC showed some subtle difference. Increased FC was found in the right cuneus gyrus (Cuneus_R) and the left temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L) (  and  ). Subgroup analysis of seed-based FC revealed that decreased FC was still found in the Occipital_Sup_R, the Frontal_Mid_L, and the Frontal_Inf_Orb_L. At the same time, we also found increased FC in cerebellum, such as right Crus I and II of cerebellar hemisphere gyrus. Besides, we found decreased FC in the right supramarginal gyrus (SupraMarginal_R), the inferior frontal gyrus of orbital part (Frontal_Inf_Orb) while increased FC was found in the right gyrus rectus (Rectus_R), right lingual gyrus (Lingual_R) and lobule of vermis (  and  ). For the migraine without aura (MwoA), increased FC was revealed in left lingual gyrus (Lingual_L), the left superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L), right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), and left superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_L), while decreased FC was found right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri (Cingulum_Mid_R), Frontal_Mid_L, and right precuneus (Precuneus_R) (  and  ); About migraine (MIG) group, we also found increased FC in the Postcentral_L, decreased FC in Frontal_Inf_Tri_L and Frontal_Sup_L, which is consistent with the main results. Besides, we found some different brain region in MIG group, the left temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L), the left precentral gyrus (Precentral_L), the left superior parietal gyrus (Parietal_Sup_L), and the left precuneus gyrus (Precuneus_L) was increase in FC compared with healthy subjects, while the left inferior parietal (Parietal_Inf_L) and the left precuneus was decrease in FC relative to healthy subjects (  and  ). For the adult subgroup meta-analysis, the great majority of the results were consistent with the main meta-analysis results. However, the increased FC was also found in the Precuneus_R and Lingual_R, the decreased FC was also showed in the right supramarginal gyrus (SurpraMarginal_R) and the left inferior frontal gyrus of opercular part (Frontal_Inf_Oper_L) in adult group (  and  ). For the no-medication subgroup analysis, decreased FC in the Frontal_Mid_L and Frontal_Sup_L was also found, while increased FC was showed in the precentral gyrus (Precentral_L) and left middle temporal gyrus (Temporal_Mid_L) in migraine relative to healthy subjects. About subgroup analyses of medication status, Clusters still showing increase FC in the calcarine gyrus, decreased in Postcentral_R, Occipital_Sup_R, Frontal_Inf_Orb_R in migraine patients compared with healthy subjects ( ,   and  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Sensitivity test for the main findings \n  \nJackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that rs-FC results remained largely consistent. After nine repeated meta-analyses using the \u201cleave-one-out cross-validation\u201d (LOOCV), as shown in  , the Calcarine_R and Frontal_Mid_L were replicated in all nine meta-analyses. The right cerebellum and Cingulum_Post_R were stably preserved in 8/9 of the datasets. The results in the Occipital_Inf_L, Postcentral_L, ParaHippocampal_R, Postcentral_R, and Frontal_Sup_L remained significant in seven meta-analyses. Other brain regions remained significant in six meta-analyses. The heterogeneity analysis revealed significant between-study variability of FC changes in the right calcarine gyrus; this may have arisen due to the clinical differences between studies ( ). In addition, none of the brain regions showed significant publication bias based on Egger\u2019s test (  p   > 0.05). And we provided funnel plots of the meta-analysis to visualize the possibility of publication bias in  . \n\n\n### 3.5. Meta-regression analysis \n  \nAge, the duration of the disease and the frequency of attacks of patients in included studies were collated by us in current study. In the meta-regression analysis, no significant correlation was found between the mean age of the patients (available in all studies), the duration of the disease [available in all studies but two ( ;  )] or attack frequency [available in all studies but two ( ;  )] and the abnormality of FC. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis was the first study to systematically examine the rs-FC within DMN in migraine patients. The current study comprehensively reviewed nine studies, using a quantitative SDM meta-analysis to reveal abnormalities associated with DMN in migraine. We found that compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients showed abnormal connectivity of rs-FC in key nodes of DMN, such as ParaHippocampal_R, Frontal_Mid_L, Cingulum_Post_R. In addition to this, there were abnormalities of rs-FC presented in other cortical areas, like the occipital lobe, cerebellum, and some region of the injury perception pathway. The present study highlighted the crucial role of the DMN in migraine pathology, and provides a reliable reference for further understanding of its pathogenesis. \n\nIn specific terms, we found reduced FC in the Frontal_Mid_L, Frontal_Sup_L, and Frontal_Inf_Tri_L, Frontal_Mid_L as part of the prefrontal cortex, was engaged in the cognitive assessment and regulation of pain ( ). In a prior functional brain pathway study, FC of the middle frontal gyrus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were reduced in migraine patients without aura compared to healthy subjects ( ). This reduced connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the pain intensity of migraine attack ( ). Brain structure in migraine patients revealed that the gray matter volume and the folding coefficient of the middle frontal gyrus were reduced in migraine patients without aura ( ). The superior frontal gyrus was involved in emotional responses and the participative feelings of pain ( ). The left inferior frontal gyrus played a role in cognitive modulation of pain as well as memory retrieval and emotional pain regulation ( ). Several studies supported linking migraine physiopathology with the left inferior frontal gyrus ( ;  ). For example, aberrant cerebral perfusion changes in the left inferior frontal gyrus in migraineurs have been found ( ). In our subgroup analysis, we also found abnormalities of FC in other brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus of orbital part and opercular part) of the frontal lobe. These brain regions of rs-FC abnormalities were associated with migraine and other pain disorders in the past studies ( ;  ), indirectly suggesting that the frontal cortex plays an important role in pain perception and regulation, and to a certain extent, it is possibly involved in the development of migraine. \n\nIn the current study, the right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), superior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Sup_R), left middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_L), and inferior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Inf_L), which are part of the occipital lobe, showed abnormal FC in migraine patients. Abnormalities in the occipital lobe were found to closely relate to migraine ( ;  ). For example, the theory of cortical spreading of depression is an important hypothesis of migraine and is widely considered to be the pathological mechanism of migraine with aura, and emphasizes the importance of abnormalities in the occipital lobe in migraine ( ;  ). Besides, the occipital lobe is now generally considered to be hyperexcitable in migraine ( ). Such excitability leads to a lower threshold for migraine attacks, and that cortical diffusion inhibition arises when certain stimuli are present, leading to migraine attacks. In other words, when patients suffer migraine attacks, the body\u2019s self-protective mechanisms may reduce the frequency and the degree of pain of migraine attacks by decreasing the excitability of the occipital cortex. Consistent with these studies, we also found abnormal FC in brain regions associated with the occipital cortex. This reflected the idea that the occipital lobe related to visual function may be an important pathogenesis of migraine. Besides, we also found abnormal FC in the cuneus and lingual gyrus in some subgroup analyses, these regions are the major regions of the visual network in previous studies ( ;  ). Established studies illustrated the hypermetabolism of the lingual gyrus and the cuneus, which is involved in the perceptual abnormalities associated with visual, such as photophobia ( ;  ). It is necessary to note that Calcarine_R is heterogeneous in the results, which may be due to clinical variations in patients between studies ( ). Hence this abnormality in FC of this brain region needs to be treated with caution and suggests that we can pay further attention to abnormal variations in Calcarine_R in migraine patients in the future. \n\nOur meta-analysis also revealed enhanced rs-FC in the right posterior cingulate gyrus (Cingulum_Post_R) and the right parahippocampal gyrus (ParaHippocampal_R) in migraine patients. Migraine patients often suffer from pain. While the pain processing is complex and it may be regulated by brain regions of DMN, such as the cingulate gyrus and ParaHippocampal_R ( ). For example, the ParaHippocampal_R participates in the abnormal processing of allodynia ( ). Metabolic abnormalities in the posterior cingulate gyrus have been suggested in previous studies in migraine patients without aura ( ), and a significant negative correlation between the gray matter density of the posterior cingulate gyrus bilaterally and pain sensitivity was also noted ( ). The present results imply that these regions may be involved in pain modulation for migraine patients. \n\nMigraine patients also showed FC abnormalities on the postcentral gyrus in the main results and abnormalities on the precentral gyrus in the subgroup analyses compared to healthy subjects. The postcentral gyrus precentral gyrus is not only a key brain region in the central brain network of pain modulation responsible for information processing of painful stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ), it has also been suggested to be involved in the trigeminal-thalamo-cortical injury perception pathway, which is related to the pathophysiology of migraine ( ). For example, migraine patients demonstrated significantly decreased FC between the right postcentral gyrus and right substantia nigra, and the altered FC was negatively associated with migraine duration ( ). Meanwhile, the reduced low-frequency amplitude of the postcentral gyrus in patients was captured in the neural activity during the migraine interval ( ) and cortical thinning within the postcentral gyrus in migraine patients ( ). Consistent with the results of these studies, the present study also found a decrease in FC of postcentral gyrus in migraine patients. Additionally, MRI studies showed that the postcentral gyrus is activated by painful stimulation ( ;  ). Increase in FC also has been found in the left postcentral gyrus in this study, this may be due to subtle differences in brain function between the left and right hemispheres. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the abnormalities of the left and right postcentral gyrus in migraine patients in the future. Abnormalities of the postcentral gyrus in patients may be associated with disruptions in networks related to pain modulation. This further suggests that the postcentral gyrus in the \u201ccentral brain network of pain modulation\u201d may be characteristically altered in migraine patients. \n\nEnhanced FC was found in the right cerebellum (lobule IV/V) in this study, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The cerebellum is primarily responsible for nociceptive avoidance behavior. For instance, when there is an increased spontaneous cerebellar activity, the cerebellum has stronger resistance to injury ( ). Some studies have found that the cerebellum plays a regulatory role in pain processing and pain perception ( ;  ). Established studies provided increasing evidence that the cerebellum is associated with migraine. For example, studies have found abnormal cerebellar function in migraine patients, mainly in terms of cerebellar hyperactivation and abnormal spontaneous cerebellar activity when stimulated by negative emotional images ( ,  ). In terms of structure, it has also been found that the gray matter volume of cerebellar regions is smaller in patients with chronic migraine compared to healthy subjects ( ;  ). The present results further support the potential association of the cerebellum with the pathogenesis of migraine ( ). \n\nIn additional, influenced by different methods, disease subtypes and medication use, we also found abnormalities of FC in other brain regions. The temporal lobe (temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus) is significantly affected by migraine in our analyses, which is consistent with the results of previous studies ( ). And the temporal lobe is an associative multisensory area that also processes visual and auditory information have been confirmed ( ). The precuneus is a core region of the DMN involved in migraine in our subgroup analyses. Abnormalities in the precuneus have been found to potentially affect information transmission, multimodal integration, and pain sensitivity and processing in patients with MwoA ( ;  ). Abnormalities in FC of the supramarginal gyrus have also been reported frequently in subgroup analyses. The supramarginal gyrus is particularly engaged in the cognitive assessment of pain ( ;  ), and reduced pain-related activity in the suprachiasmatic gyrus has been reported in patients with overmedicated headaches ( ). The results of these subgroup analyses suggested that FC abnormalities between patients with different clinical information could be studied in detail to more precisely understand the pathogenesis of migraine. \n\nSeveral limitations need to be considered in this study. Firstly, the nine studies included in our meta-analysis differ in age and gender of the subjects, and migraine patients of different genders and age stages may exhibit different DMN abnormalities. We recommend that future studies systematically analyze data from the same age level or the same gender population. Secondly, the AES-SDM approach used in the present study is based on the reported coordinates of previous studies rather than the raw imaging data, future studies could conduct meta-analyses based on the brain maps to add more detailed information. Finally, despite our efforts to obtain information, the number of included studies was relatively small (i.e., nine studies), further research in this field is necessary to confirm and extend these findings. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nIn the current study, we included all available publications using an rs-FC analysis within DMN and performed a meta-analysis to determine the consistency and robustness of altered FC within the DMN in migraine patients. Migraine patients exhibited abnormal FC within DMN as well as some other regions associated with the central brain network of pain modulation. The present study can be considered an exploratory study that provides the primary evidence for the study of functional abnormalities in the DMN in migraine patients.

Prior studies have lacked consistency in identifying common regions of altered neural activity during cognitive tasks. This may be partly due to differences in task paradigm, patient heterogeneity, and methods of fMRI analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method to identify regions of differential brain activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. We included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute time points post-injury. The seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The results of our coordinate based meta-analysis revealed a single cluster of reduced activation within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that differentiated mTBI from healthy controls. We conclude that the cognitive impairments in memory and attention typically reported in mTBI patients may be associated with a deficit in the right MFG, which impacts the recruitment of neural networks important for attentional control. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver the last two decades, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been employed to investigate functional neuroanatomical networks that relate to cognition following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI;  ). Measurement of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in mTBI during cognitive performance can reveal greater increases (i.e. hyperactivation) and decreases (i.e. hypoactivation) in neural activation across a range of brain regions when compared to a healthy control group. A reduction in neural activity compared to controls has been suggested as a disruption of functional efficiency leading to poorer task performance ( ;  ), whereas increased activation has been theorized as compensatory or due to the recruitment of additional resources to facilitate behavioral responses to cognitive demands ( ;  ). \n\nThe earliest example of fMRI research into mTBI reported greater activation in the frontal-temporal and lateral parietal regions, despite similar behavioral performance to controls, during a task of working memory ( ). More recent studies investigating the differences in brain activity between healthy controls and patients with mTBI have identified changes in several areas of the brain that serve higher-order cognitive processes, including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC and VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and posterior areas such as the thalamus and cerebellum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Conversely, other studies have shown decreased activation (i.e. hypoactivation) when tasks examining executive functions were less challenging ( ) and in pediatric samples ( ;  ). Furthermore, some studies have observed no BOLD differences between groups ( ;  ;  ), highlighting issues of inter-subject variability, timing in post-injury assessment, and differences in the method of fMRI analysis ( ). Thus, the use of a quantitative meta-analysis to address experiment-specific variation and identify common mTBI-related neural activation differences across cognitive tasks is warranted. \n\nThe Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis method ( ) is a quantitative voxel-wise meta-analysis technique that compares the results of neuroimaging studies using reported coordinates in a standardized 3D atlas space in order to identify consistently activated neuroanatomical regions. In a meta-analysis using this methodology,   identified several regions of greater and lesser activation in mTBI compared with healthy controls. The pattern of brain activation suggested reduced activity in anterior regions (e.g. bilateral DLPFC and ACC) and increased activity in posterior regions (e.g. cerebellum, insula, and SMG). Additional findings from  , which included an ALE meta-analysis on working memory experiments, suggest that the type of task and its relative cognitive difficulty may also partially explain the differential activation patterns displayed in mTBI patients. \n\nHowever, a recent report of error in multiple-comparison corrections in older versions of the meta-analytic software used by the prior meta-analyses has emerged ( ). Correcting for multiple comparisons by controlling the (voxel-level) false discovery rate (FDR) leads to inflated positive findings ( ;  ). Another limitation from prior meta-analyses is the inclusion of data that is derived from explicit region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. This can lead to inflated significance for the respective regions when included with experiments deriving coordinates from a whole-brain analysis ( ). Furthermore, due to a small number of studies, prior meta-analyses did not have enough power to explore the effects of experimental variables (e.g. timing post-injury) and were prone to yield clusters of convergence that are almost exclusively driven by single experiments ( ;  ). Together, these factors may have resulted in a high number of spurious findings in prior meta-analyses. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a fMRI meta-analysis of cognitive-related activation differences between healthy controls and patients with mTBI using the most recent ALE approach and focusing on studies that met more specific methodological inclusion criteria. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources and search strategy \n  \nA comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify task-based fMRI studies that compared neural responses between patients with mTBI and a healthy control group (see   for an outline of this process). The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid (MEDLINE\u00ae Daily\u00a0+\u00a0Epub Ahead of Print\u00a0+\u00a0In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE Classic\u00a0+\u00a0EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED), EBSCOhost (CINAHL Complete), Wiley Online Library (Cochrane Library), Scopus, and Informit (Health Collection). The searches were confined to full-text research manuscripts published in English and indexed from January 1990 to October 16, 2019.   \nPreferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram. BOLD, blood oxygenation level dependent; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; ROI, region of interest; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nDetailed electronic search strategies and syntax were developed in collaboration with a librarian experienced in systematic reviews (see  ). The key search terms included: Glasgow coma outcome; Glasgow coma scale*; score*; unconscious*; Pneumocephalus; rancho los amigos scale; injur*; trauma*; damag*; wound*; fractur*; contusion*; haematoma*; hematoma*; haemorrhag*; hemorrhag*; pressur*; lesion*; destruction*; oedema*; edema*; contusion*; concus*; swell*; bleed*; mild*; minor; mtbi; concuss*; postconcuss*; post-concuss*; posttraum*; post-traum*; symptom*; syndrome*; complaint*; mri; neuroimag*; fmri; function*; magnetic; brain; neuro; imag*; resonance; Blood Volume; Hemoglobins; Oxygen; blood oxygen level dependent; BOLD; oxyhemoglobin; deoxyhemoglobin; memor*; cognit*; executive function*; executive; dysfunction*; Motor Skills; functionality; attention; memory; disorder*; dysfunction; impaired; impairment; difficult*; problem*; disability; organiz*; organis*; plan*; manag*; problem solving; decision making; and disorder. Additional articles were collected by hand-searching reference lists of relevant articles. \n\n\n### Screening and eligibility \n  \nThe assessing author independently evaluated titles and abstracts of identified studies using the web-based reference management program Mendeley (Mendeley Ltd., London, UK). Studies were included if they met the eligibility criteria listed below.   \nReported original data from a task-based fMRI (review papers excluded). \n  \nIncluded an adult sample (> 18 years) of patients diagnosed with a mTBI using criteria similar to or consistent with the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre Task Force definition ( ). \n  \nIncluded a whole brain voxel-based BOLD analysis incorporating a cognitive challenge compared with a control (less challenge or baseline) condition (excluding ROI analyses). \n  \nActivation coordinates reported in standardized stereotaxic space [either MNI ( ) or Talairach ( ) space]. \n  \nIncluded a healthy control group and presented the results of a 2 -level (group-level) mTBI vs control contrast analysis. \n  \n\nWe only included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute (i.e. acute 0\u20137 days, subacute 8\u201389 days) time points post-injury ( ). There are many potential confounding factors that would need to be considered if we examined studies including people who sustained their injuries many months or years prior to imaging. If a study did not report the results of a mTBI group separately from moderate/severe TBI participants (e.g.  ), they were excluded. Results from pharmacological or psychological intervention experiments were only included if they reported either baseline between-group differences or treatment main effects involving a placebo/control condition (e.g.  ). If a study conducted an ANOVA analysis, the information equivalent to the mTBI vs. control contrast from the reported group main effects and interactions was selected (e.g.  ). Both greater and lesser (compared to controls) reported activations were included. As the ALE method attempts to identify areas of convergence across significant results, articles that did not report significant findings were unable to be included as there were no coordinates to add to the dataset ( ). For articles that reported results from multiple tasks using the same group (e.g.  ) or used a longitudinal design (e.g.  ), the first contrast of interest was selected to minimize the contribution of any one set of participants to the results from the meta-analysis. We contacted authors of studies who did not report activation coordinates in their paper or presented their results as figures for the additional information (e.g.  ). After initial screening, seven publications fulfilled the aforementioned eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (see   and   for details of the studies and included contrasts).   \nDescription of sample characteristics from the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 1       \nExperiment and contrast specific details of the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n### Data Extraction and analysis \n  \nThe following data was extracted from each study: first author; year of publication; demographics of mTBI and control subjects (age, number, sex); time to scan following mTBI (the mean/range time between injury and fMRI), injury specific information (mechanism, diagnostic criteria, number of symptomatic/asymptomatic patients and type of measure used, history of previous TBI, and structural imaging findings); task specific (paradigm type, cognitive domain, and if there was a significant difference in behavioral performance between groups); and ALE analysis specific information (source of stereotaxic coordinates, type and number of contrasts included, magnetic field strength (tesla) for fMRI, and whether statistical significance threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons). Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for all 2-group comparisons (the latter was used when the assumptions of normality and variance heterogeneity were violated). \n\n\n### ALE analyses \n  \nWe carried out the ALE meta-analyses using GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org/ale). ALE assesses the spatial convergence between reported neuroimaging studies by modelling the reported foci in each study as probability distributions centered on their respective coordinates ( ;  ). This version has fixed errors in both FDR and Family Wise Error (FWE) cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous iterations ( ). In brief, a bug in the code that incorrectly sorted   P   values before FDR correction found in versions prior to v.2.3.3 allowed for lenient inferences above the cut-off criterion. Additionally, the procedure for establishing the null-distribution of cluster-sizes for cluster-level FWE thresholding contained an error of including all sizes rather than recording the maximum. Prior to a fix in v2.3.2, this resulted in inference based on uncorrected cluster-level   P   values. We used the non-additive algorithm ( ) to minimize within-experiment effects. Prior to the analyses, coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using GingerALE's Talairach to MNI conversion tool. The resulting ALE maps were determined at a recommended cluster-level FWE rate-corrected threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, and a cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 with 1000 permutations ( ). \n\nThree separate analyses were conducted: (1) The first analysis (7 experiments, 64 foci, 313 subjects) pooled all comparisons between mTBI patients and healthy controls; (2) the second analysis (4 experiments, 41 foci, 153 subjects) only included contrasts that reported greater brain activity (mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0control) in mTBI relative to the healthy control group; and (3) the third analysis (4 experiments, 23 foci, 222 subjects) tested for areas of decreased activation in the mTBI group (mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls). For illustration, the ALE maps were displayed using MRIcron ( ) with anatomical labelling guided by a Colin27_T1_seg_MNI_2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 template using the Mango visualization program (version 4.0.1.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Description of included studies and participants \n  \nThe seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The average age of the mTBI group was 29.1 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a028.1;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a06.2; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201335; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201338) and more than half were male (57.7%; 95% CI: 44\u201371%). The control group's average age was 29.0 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a029.9;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a05.3; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201333; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201334) and more than half were male (59.7%; 95% CI: 47\u201372%). Independent t-tests revealed no significant differences in sample size (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.440), age (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.977), or sex (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.796) between groups. \n\nFunctional imaging was performed at an average of 31.1 days (range = 0\u201369 days) after head injury. The mechanisms of trauma in the mTBI patients included motor vehicle collisions (  n  \u00a0=\u00a033), falls (  n  \u00a0=\u00a037), assault (  n  \u00a0=\u00a04), sport-related concussion (  n  \u00a0=\u00a038), and other mechanisms not defined (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05). Of the five studies that incorporated Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC) into their diagnosis, three reported GCS scores (  M   = 14.5;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.5) and 26 individuals with mTBI were identified as having some duration of LOC. Two experiments used sport-related concussion diagnostic guidelines ( ;  ). Four studies included measures of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms that were all greater in the mTBI group ( ;  ;  ;  ). Seven individuals with a previous history of mTBI were reported in one study ( ). Two studies included subjects with abnormal structural imaging ( ;  ), consisting of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01) and microbleeds (  n  \u00a0=\u00a020). \n\nFour studies used the   n  -back working memory paradigm, two employed attention-based tasks with auditory stimuli, and one study utilized a battery of oculomotor tasks. Block design was used in five of the studies and a 3\u00a0T magnet was used most commonly to acquire imaging data. For six out of seven studies, similar performance was reported on the cognitive tasks between the mTBI group and the control group. Only one study reported a difference in behavioral performance between groups ( ). The method of fMRI analysis was variable across the range of studies and included uncorrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02) and corrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05) thresholding. \n\nIncreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with increased activation was 11, 9, 20, and 1 across those studies. Decreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with decreased activation was 1, 6, 7, and 9 across those studies. One study reported 20 areas of increased activation and 9 areas of decreased activation ( ). \n\n\n### ALE findings \n  \nIn the pooled whole-brain meta-analysis of the seven studies that reported 64 foci of activation, a single activation cluster that differentiated between patients with mTBI and healthy controls was found in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA 9; see   and  ). For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 41 foci of increased activation, there were no significant clusters of increased activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 23 foci of decreased activation, the mTBI group showed reduced activation compared with controls within the right MFG (see   and  ).   \nMeta-analytical map of pooled activation in mTBI group.

Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis, and those studies reported inconsistent findings. Across the seven studies, 64 foci of activation, 41 areas of hyperactivation and 23 areas of hypoactivation, were identified. The result of our pooled meta-analysis revealed a single significant activation cluster in the right MFG in those with mTBI compared to controls. Secondary analyses examining the directionality of group contrasts (i.e., mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0controls; mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls), revealed less activation in the same cluster in the right MFG in mTBI versus controls. No significant clusters were observed when including contrasts only from experiments reporting greater activations in mTBI. \n\nThe total number of included experiments (  n  \u00a0=\u00a07) was slightly lower compared to previous meta-analyses. Five of the primary studies from   were excluded for being limited to ROI results only ( ;  ;  ), including an adolescent sample ( ), or being a resting-state fMRI study ( ). Similarly, seven studies from   were excluded for reporting on ROI results only ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ), or including an adolescent sample ( ). \n\nThe significant cluster activated in the right MFG during cognitive-based tasks was consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses. However, our study did not support the previous findings of significant clusters in other regions of the frontal-parietal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate) and in more posterior areas (e.g., cerebellar tonsil). These observations could be accounted for by the differences in the studies included and/or the use of more lenient statistical thresholds used in previous meta-analyses. In the current meta-analysis, the right MFG was reported as a region of activation in five out of seven of the included studies. Examining the results from these studies, three reported a statistically significant reduction in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ;  ), and two reported statistically significant increases in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ). Potential sources of this variation may be explained by differences in experimental design, analytical methodology, and participant characteristics ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nWithin the prefrontal cortex, the MFG is connected to a network of regions that are commonly co-activated during tasks requiring executive functions ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, the right MFG has been proposed to be a convergence site between the ventral attention network (VAN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), which work in conjunction to switch between goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention by filtering out distractions and orienting attention to task-relevant information ( ;  ). This region has been suggested to be \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d that interrupts DAN functioning to reorient attention towards novel task-relevant stimuli ( ;  ). In the context of mTBI, previous functional neuroimaging studies have reported differential activation in the right MFG area across a variety of cognitive paradigms with the majority of tasks involving working memory ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Taken together, altered recruitment of the right MFG after mTBI may represent an over-arching disruption in modulating attention. These findings are also consistent with resting-state fMRI studies in concussion and mTBI, which have observed altered functional connectivity in the right MFG ( ) as well as other regions that mediate internally-oriented processes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs evidenced in our included experiments (see  ), the   n  -back paradigm is the most frequently used working memory task in the current mTBI literature. It is used to assess an individual's ability to hold information in mind for further processing while subject to increasing cognitive demand ( ). Working memory is an area of cognition that has been found to be adversely affected by mTBI ( ;  ;  ). Further, problems with working memory also emerge during the early recovery phase rather than forming part of the initial symptomology ( ). Our finding of disturbed right MFG activation in mTBI patients may therefore reflect atypical neurophysiological changes associated with cognitive impairments in memory and attention. This view is supported by functional differentiation evidence that show the right MFG as an area of focus in task demand/novelty processing ( ;  ). \n\nA novel finding in the present work is that contrast-specific involvement of the right MFG was apparent for our analysis that incorporated hypoactivation findings and not for those that reported hyperactivation. Various authors have attempted to conceptualize the directionality of recruitment in the prefrontal region following brain injury in relation to task performance. It has been proposed that greater activation in response to a cognitively demanding task may represent a transient compensatory effect ( ;  ), permanent rewiring ( ;  ), or the result of a native support mechanism to assist in task performance ( ;  ). Conversely, underactivity (i.e. hypoactivation) may reflect a disruption in this network caused by pathophysiological changes which limit the capacity for focused attention and external goal directed processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Of note, cognitive task performance was mostly equivalent between our meta-analysis group of mTBI and healthy controls (see  ). In six out of seven studies, the mTBI group performed similarly to the control group on the cognitive task. One methodological constraint with imaging research is requiring near perfect accuracy on tasks to facilitate data interpretation ( ). Furthermore, recruitment demand for prefrontal regions following brain injury has been shown to diminish at similar rates in both injured and healthy controls with increased task practice and familiarity ( ). Thus, while our findings are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying cause are unclear. \n\nFrom   and  , the description of participant characteristics highlights the scope and context of inter-subject variation in mTBI. Within our mTBI group, the number of sport-related concussions, motor vehicle accidents, and falls as injury mechanisms was relatively similar. However, biomechanical loading data reveal that primary injury strain and impact forces vary considerably depending on injury mechanism and are not uniformly distributed across grey and white matter regions of the brain ( ;  ). Previous reviews into the adaptive and pathophysiological changes following mTBI ( ;  ) also highlight the issue of a complex and time-varied injury profile. Although we limited the scope of functional assessment post-injury to the acute-subacute phase, there is no clear consensus on how these processes affect recovery as measured by fMRI after mTBI ( ). This is evidenced in longitudinal fMRI studies which showcase varied patterns of within-subject BOLD signal changes ( ;  ;  ). Finally, it is important to note the subset of subjects with complications identified on structural scans. Whereas some definitions of mTBI include patients with intracranial imaging abnormalities ( ), it is increasingly more common in current studies to reclassify mTBI into uncomplicated and complicated dichotomies based on CT/MRI findings ( ). However, symptom outcomes associated with structural findings remains inconsistent ( ;  ). Even though our activation clusters were not driven by singular studies (see  ), it is important to consider these inter-subject variability factors regarding the outcome of inferential analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nA vital consideration for the current meta-analysis and for fMRI methodology in general, is that the vasculature that underlies the BOLD signal can be impaired following brain trauma. Alterations in cerebral blood flow, perfusion, and vascular reactivity have all been found following mTBI ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Alteration in the cerebrovascular dynamics can lead to subsequent change in the ratio of intravascular oxy- to deoxyhemoglobin, which contribute to the BOLD signal ( ;  ). For example, a recent series of fMRI studies found that the shape and magnitude of the signal can differentiate between a sample of mTBI patients and controls ( ,  ). While the authors found signal disturbance within several areas in the mTBI group, most cortical and subcortical regions involved during the visual tracking tasks were normal. Therefore, it remains to be known whether these secondary pathophysiological changes affect the BOLD signal across the entire brain or only the most vulnerable areas ( ). Ideally, future studies should measure baseline cerebrovascular parameters (e.g. cerebral blood flow) to partial out any potential effect of neurovascular uncoupling due to alterations in vascular physiology. \n\nCompared to previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, we used the latest version of ALE software and included several additional studies not previously incorporated ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Additionally, we did not include any study that used an explicit ROI analysis ( ;  ,  ;  ) or adolescent population ( ;  ). While our study represents the most up-to-date literature search of fMRI findings in mTBI, our conservative inclusion criteria limited the total number of experiments available. Owing to the low numbers of experiments, our ALE meta-analysis may not have had enough power to completely partial out subject-specific variation ( ). Separate exploratory meta-analyses investigating the effect of task domain and type, behavioral performance, time after injury, age, and corrected threshold contrast could not be performed due to strict inclusion criteria and the number of experiments available ( ). Future studies addressing these variations will lead to improved research outcomes and a better understanding of the impaired functional networks that may underlie cognitive dysfunction in mTBI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present meta-analysis employed a coordinate-based ALE approach to identify affected brain areas relating to cognitive dysfunction following mTBI. We used GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org/ale), a version of ALE that has fixed errors in both FDR and FWE cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous versions of the program. Our results revealed neural activation differences across a variety of cognitive tasks, with the mTBI group displaying hypoactivation within the right MFG. Consistent with prior meta-analyses ( ;  ) this finding suggests that the prefrontal region may be particularly affected following mTBI. However, although these results are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying causes remain unclear and require future study. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nMichael J.

Our results show that PD patients exhibit a significantly decreased response in the basal ganglia (putamen and pallidum) and a trend toward decreased activity in the mirror system, particularly in the left parietal cortex (inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus). This reduced activation may be tied to a disruption of cognitive resonance mechanisms and may thus constitute the basis of impaired others\u2019 representations underlying action and emotion perception. We also found increased activation in the posterior cerebellum in PD, although only in a within-group analysis and not in comparison with healthy controls. This cerebellar activation may reflect compensatory mechanisms, an aspect that deserves further investigation. We discuss the clinical implications of our findings for the development of novel social skill training programs for PD patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.,  ). It is usually associated with manifest motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia and akinesia, but neurocognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders can also be observed (for recent reviews, see  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Within the neurocognitive sphere, PD can be characterized by disorders of social cognition (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Social perception is one of the main social abilities affected in patients with PD ( ), particularly for what concerns action observation ( ), face perception ( ), and emotion recognition ( ). These social anomalies may lead to a wide range of negative outcomes, such as loneliness, stigma, and dehumanization, which might impair the patient\u2019s life more than other symptoms ( ). Despite this evidence, the neural substrates of social perception deficits in PD remain to be clarified ( ). \n\nPD is characterized by neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia, particularly the dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra ( ). Although social deficits in PD have been related to dopamine depletion in these nuclei ( ), particularly in the putamen ( ), alterations in the functioning of other brain regions may contribute to the impairment. Among these, the cerebellum \u2013 which is known to be involved in cognitive processing beyond motor control ( ,  ) - may play a critical role ( ). Indeed, abnormal cerebellum activity has been observed in PD patients during both cognitive (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) and social perception (e.g.,  ) tasks, as well as during rest conditions (e.g.,  ). Moreover, PD patients may show a hyper-metabolism in the cerebellum, possibly as a compensatory effort ( ): it is likely that the increased activity or connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop compensate the hypofunction in the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit to maintain function at a near normal level ( ,  ). Indeed, the results of several studies suggest that the cerebellar hyperactivation allows patients with PD to execute motor tasks at the same level as healthy controls (e.g.,  ). Moreover, machine-learning classification has shown that morphological alterations in the cerebellum are predictive of PD ( ). Importantly, however, the association between cerebellar activity and motor symptoms of PD is complex: in stark contrast to the compensatory mechanism hypothesis, changes in cerebellum activation have been associated with motor dysfunction of PD, such as resting tremor ( ), bradykinesia, and dyskinesias ( ). \n\nIn addition to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, other regions seem to be associated with social perception alterations in PD.   reported that emotion recognition in PD patients was associated with decreased responses in mirror neuron areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the supplementary motor cortex compared to healthy controls, possibly reflecting a disruption of neural resonance and thus be the basis of impaired emotion recognition in PD. In turn, other studies reported a somehow opposite pattern showing increased activation in somatosensory cortices (parietal lobe) during emotion recognition, this enhanced activation likely functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced striatal activation ( ). Furthermore, other studies reported a sub-cortical dysfunction during social perception processes in PD, particularly in the amygdala ( ). Neuroimaging results, however, have been overall inconsistent across studies ( ). \n\nMeta-analyses integrate experimental findings stemming from separate experiments into a unifying statistical model, thus highlighting the consistency of neural patterns shared by such experiments ( ). Although a recent   meta  -analysis by   addressed the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and motor functions in PD, a neuroimaging   meta  -analysis for social processing in PD has not been carried out so far. Here, we implemented a coordinate-based   meta  -analysis on this topic, to clarify: (a) the neural bases of social perception processing in patients with PD and (b) the differences in social perception-related brain activation between patients with PD and healthy control (HC) participants. Specifically, we aimed to highlight the convergence across multiple experiments on social perception processes in patients with PD. Based on the literature, we expected to find in PD patients compared to healthy controls: a) a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia (see  ) and possibly b) evidence of increased activity in the cerebellum during processing of social information, which, as highlighted above, may be indicative of either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ), or motor dysfunction ( ). Regarding effects in the parietal cortex, we do not have specific hypotheses, considering that opposite results have been reported (see   for compensatory mechanisms, and   for defective mechanisms). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Rationale of the   meta  -analytic approach \n  \nWe used a set of ALE   meta  -analyses to investigate the neural basis of impaired social perception in PD patients and their specificity with respect to healthy control individuals. Meta-analyses can overcome the limitations that individual neuroimaging experiments suffer from ( ). To carry out the   meta  -analysis for this study, we resorted to ALE, a statistical approach that capitalizes on Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates to integrate previously published experimental results ( ). Using ALE, we carried out two different analyses: one on PD patients\u2019 data, and one on HC participants\u2019 data. After that, we contrasted the respective   meta  -analyses between the two groups. Our goal was to identify the group-specific brain activations underlying social perception, irrespective of experimental materials (i.e., verbal or pictorial stimuli) and employed tasks (e.g., implicit or explicit; action observation or evaluation tasks; etc.). \n\nBy taking into account the variety of experimental procedures (i.e. materials and tasks) that have been used in studies on social perception, and by aggregating such variety   meta  -analytically, we can more confidently ensure the generalizability of our results beyond specific methodological choices ( ). The criteria for including studies in our   meta  -analysis were defined by M.A., and then verified by the other authors. This multiple verification by independent investigators can minimize the selection bias ( ). \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nOur literature selection started by searching on Pubmed ( ) for the following keyword strings: \u201csocial cognition Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial cognition Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cfacial Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d and \u201cfacial Parkinson PET\u201d. The preliminary pool of 870 retrieved studies, after duplicate removal, was evaluated based on title and abstract. The criteria for including studies in our   meta  -analysis were as follows: ( ):   \nPRISMA diagram depicting the selection process. \n  \n\n1 Reports written in English. \n\n2. Empirical studies using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (  f  MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), excluding studies using other neuroimaging techniques (i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)) with different spatial and temporal resolution. \n\n3. Studies based on whole-brain images and analyses, thus excluding reports of neuroanatomically more restricted analyses produced by the application of regions of interest (ROIs) or small volume correction (SVC) ( ). \n\n4. Studies on individuals diagnosed with PD, in which the presence and the severity of the impairment was assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) ( ). We decided to include this selection criteria as a check for the clinical evaluation of PD, given that UPDRS is the most well-established scale for assessing disability and impairment of PD ( ). Importantly, no studies were excluded for not fulfilling this criterion. \n\n5. Studies reporting the results of within-group comparisons, between-group comparisons, or both. More specifically, we selected coordinates from: (i) within-group simple effects, or/and (ii) between-group comparisons (i.e., PD vs. HC). We included the within-group data into the analyses to get a better overview on whether a specific brain area was more strongly associated with one group than the other, while still showing activation in both groups, or else whether the same brain area was exclusively activated in just one group (e.g.,  ). By including coordinates from different types of contrasts (i.e., both between and within), we tried to maximize the number of included papers with a specific focus on social perception in each group. \n\n6. Functional neuroimaging studies focused on social perception. More specifically, we ascertained to only include studies that reported statistical contrasts specifically targeting: \n\na) Human face and human action perception, involving the representation of other individuals. Therefore, we retained only tasks requiring participants to process stimuli eliciting a representation of others\u2019 actions and contrasting this with control conditions without human representation ( ), as well as tasks comparing the perception of faces versus non-meaningful mosaic-like colored patterns ( ). \n\nb) Direct comparisons between emotional stimuli and control stimuli (emotion\u00a0>\u00a0neutral in others;  ). We included paradigms in which participants attended to emotional stimuli (e.g., faces expressing positive and/or negative emotions) aimed to elicit emotional processing (either explicit or implicit), and contrasting this kind of emotional representation with control conditions in which there was no emotional characterization (e.g., neutral faces;  ). \n\nc) Positive correlations between brain activity and performance in social tasks (e.g., emotional facial recognition (EFR) task;  ) or in neuropsychological tests assessing aspects related to social deficits (e.g., depression;  ). \n\nWe excluded 760 irrelevant articles based on titles and abstracts. Closer full-text inspection of the remaining 110 articles according to the above selection criteria lead to the further exclusion of studies that did not employ   f  MRI or PET techniques (8 studies); review articles (4 studies); studies adopting either ROIs or SVC for statistical analyses (13 studies); studies not focusing on either PD patients (6 studies) or social perception (57 studies); studies not reporting essential information, such as x/y/z coordinates (8 studies). Fourteen studies in total fulfilled the above specified criteria. \n\nWe sought to increment the number of compatible studies by closely inspecting studies that did not enter our first-pass literature search but either quoted, or were quoted by, the 14 selected studies. We also closely inspected recent review articles and   meta  -analyses focused on cognitive processes in PD patients ( ,  ). This second-pass search yielded 13 additional studies matching our inclusion criteria, thus increasing the total number of selected studies to 27 ( ). Of these 27 previously published studies, 25 studies reported activation foci for PD patients and could thus be included in the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on PD patients ( ). These 25 studies provided 25 independent experiments (i.e. individual comparisons reported) with overall 455 PD subjects and 204 foci. In turn, 18 studies reported activation foci for healthy control individuals, and could enter the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on healthy controls. These 18 studies provided 18 independent experiments, with overall 317 HC subjects and 196 foci ( ). The number of studies entering the two   meta  -analyses satisfied methodological recommendations on the ALE method ( ,  ), particularly ensuring that results would not disproportionally represent just a few experiments (see also  ).   \nOverview of the 27 studies included in the   meta  -analysis on the neural bases of social perception in both patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). \n    \n\nAnother important methodological caveat is that the presence of more than one experiment including the same participants can undermine the validity of the   meta  -analytic results. To cope with this problem, we pooled the coordinates from all the relevant contrasts of a study as if they derived from just one experiment, thus effectively adjusting for within-group effects ( ). This issue concerned 14 out of 27 studies. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe used the GingerALE software 3.0.2 ( ) to conduct a set of ALE analyses aiming at the identification of the brain areas associated with social perception in either PD patients, HC, or both groups. We followed the method described by  , resulting in the same procedure reported in  . In a first step, each of the activation coordinates derived from the selected studies, keeping separate those related to PD patients from the HC ones, was taken as the centre of a three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution capturing the spatial uncertainty intrinsically associated with the coordinate data. All coordinates gathered from the selected studies that were not already in the MNI space were manually converted from the Tailairach to the MNI space by using the transformation tool supplied with GingerALE ( ). The set of activation coordinates of each experiment was used to calculate probability distributions in the image space, which was then fitted in every voxel to yield a modeled activation (MA) map. The combination of the MA maps produced the ALE scores representing the convergence across experiments of activation in each brain voxel ( ). In order to provide reliable statistical estimates (i.e. \u201ctrue\u201d convergence as opposed to random convergence), the ALE scores were contrasted against an empirically defined null distribution ( ). The null distribution is generated by random spatial association between experiments, with the distribution of foci within any given experiment maintained fixed. To this aim, a voxel was sampled at random from each MA map, and the union of the obtained values was calculated. This permutation was iterated 1,000 times and at each iteration the obtained ALE score was retained, yielding a densely sampled ALE null distribution. The comparison between the \u201ctrue\u201d and the null distribution effectively instantiates random-effects statistics, which represent the above-chance convergence across experiments, mitigating the possible preponderance of coordinate clustering in just one or in a small subset of experiments. To correct for multiple comparisons across voxels and protect against false positive errors, we adopted a p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations ( ). \n\nIn a second analytical step, the significance maps that were separately obtained from, respectively, the PD and HC studies, were used to calculate direct comparisons between PD patients and HC, and the conjunction analyses across the two groups, to unveil, respectively, specific and common   meta  -analytic activation effects. This is accomplished by first generating a conjunction image, namely the voxel-wise minimum value across the ALE images for PD and HC, representing common brain activations in the two groups ( ). Subsequently, two ALE contrasts images were generated by directly subtracting one ALE image from the other. To correct for study size, GingerALE implements a random permutation of coordinates in two groups of the same size as the original datasets. A null distribution was generated by iterating a random permutation 1,000 times, each time subtracting the ALE images of the two simulated groups. The \u201ctrue data\u201d were then compared to the null distribution at every voxel. The ALE subtraction scores were converted to Z scores. For the between-group comparisons, given the unavailability of family wise error type corrected cluster-level inference in the GingerALE software ( ), we adopted a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold (as in previous publications, see for example,  ,  ,  ,  ) and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. For exploratory purposes, in order to also reveal possible increased or decreased   meta  -analytic activation effects showing a trend towards statistical significance, we also run the within-group analyses adopting a slightly less conservative statistical threshold of\u00a0<\u00a00.1 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations. This less conservative threshold then also constituted the input for the between-group comparisons for which, as previously noted, family wise error type correction is unavailable in GingerALE, and where we therefore again used a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Social perception in patients with Parkinson disease \n  \nSocial perception processes in PD patients recruited consistent activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, alongside the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI) (  a;  ).

In turn, only a few studies have focused on the neural correlates of social perception deficits in PD patients, with rather inconsistent results. Here, we used a coordinate-based neuroimaging   meta  -analysis procedure to highlight the consistency in the available findings. This is the first neuroimaging   meta  -analysis that aimed to clarify the neural bases of social perception impairments in PD patients. We expected to find a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia and possibly an increased activity in the cerebellum in PD patients, compared to HC participants. \n\n### Social perception in PD patients \n  \nOur results show that during social perception tasks PD patients reveal consistent activations in a bilateral network involving the middle and inferior occipital gyri and the fusiform gyrus, as well as the right middle temporal gyrus and the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI). \n\nBrain responses elicited by social perception tasks have been previously found in the temporal and fusiform cortex of PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ), in agreement with our results. It is well known that the fusiform gyrus plays a fundamental role in face processing ( ,  ,  ). Other regions in the middle and superior temporal sulcus are crucially involved in social perception, and particularly in the perception of biological motion involving body parts such as faces, hands, and postures of conspecifics ( ,  ,  ). \n\nOur data are also consistent with increasing evidence showing the involvement of the posterior (lateral) cerebellum in social perception tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), as suggested also by connectivity studies showing bidirectional closed loops between the posterior cerebellar lobe and the mentalizing network ( ). In particular, we found a specific activation in the lobule VI. Lobule VI to Lobule IX represent the posterior cerebellar lobe, which is separated by the primary fissure from the anterior lobe (lobules I-V) and by the posterolateral fissure from the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X). The posterior lobe (particularly lobules VI and VII) has been associated with language, spatial, executive, working memory, and social-affective tasks ( ), rather than motor tasks ( ). The role of the cerebellum in social prediction and social perception in healthy participants has been recently supported by noninvasive brain stimulation (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and neuroimaging data (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nA general role of the posterior cerebellum in social cognition has been assumed in relation to supporting optimal predictions about social interactions ( ). In the motor domain, motor sequence predictions are created by the cerebellum and are then compared with feedback signals from external inputs. In this way, online adjusting of motor action execution becomes possible ( ). It is nowadays acknowledged that the cerebellum constructs internal models also for purely mental states, without movements or somatosensory feedback ( ,  ,  ). In this view, the posterior cerebellum may be involved in the processing of social stimuli by providing internal models of social interactions, thus allowing predicting/anticipating others\u2019 behaviors in the social environment ( ,  ,  ). Recently, also data from neuropsychological studies in children with congenital ( ) and acquired ( ) cerebellar damage supported the role of the cerebellum in social prediction. Nevertheless, as discussed in the Introduction, the exact nature of increased cerebellar activation in PD remains elusive, with contrasting interpretations favoring either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ) or motor dysfunction ( ). \n\n\n### Social perception in healthy controls \n  \nDuring social perception tasks, HC subjects displayed consistent activation in left basal ganglia. \n\nIn addition to their motor function, the basal ganglia also subserve cognitive functions ( ,  ,  ). Previous studies have pointed to a critical role of basal ganglia in social cognition processes such as emotion regulation and recognition as well as reward processing ( ,  ; for review see  ,  ). The basal ganglia, through the selection of relevant and the filtering of irrelevant emotional stimuli ( ), promote quick and appropriate behavioral responses ( ). The continuous repetition of these selection process (relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli) leads to a reinforcement of neural emotional responses, which may become largely automatic ( ). \n\n\n### Commonalities and differences between PD patients and HC during social perception tasks \n  \nWe found greater activation in healthy subjects compared to PD patients in the left basal ganglia. In turn, patients with PD had no greater activation than controls. Also, we did not find any common significant activation between patients with PD and healthy control individuals during social processing in brain areas related to recognition of social signals. However, this latter finding likely depends on the limited number of available studies reducing statistical power (for similar results, see  ,  ). \n\nSocial impairments are frequent in several basal ganglia disorders (e.g. in Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome) and have been associated with fronto-striatal dysfunctions ( ,  ). Different studies showed that the beta rhythms in basal ganglia during action perception are partially overlapping with the changes reported during action execution ( ,  ,  ), supporting the idea that basal ganglia may support mirror network patterns of activation ( ,  ). Both neuroimaging findings ( ,  ) and neuropsychological studies ( ) support the idea that socio-emotional symptoms in PD are explained by a mirror network alteration, involving also the basal ganglia ( ). \n\nThere is converging evidence that the posterior cerebellum may provide compensatory support to the dysfunctional basal ganglia in PD patients ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Accordingly to our result, several studies included in our   meta  -analysis showed posterior cerebellum activations in PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Although the direct comparison targeting stronger   meta  -analytic activations in PD than in HC did not yield any significant effects in the posterior cerebellum (possibly due to the limited sample size, see  ,  ,  ), at a qualitative level, we found an activation of the right posterior cerebellum when PD patients were analyzed alone, whereas no comparable activation was found in HC subjects. Based on these qualitative differences alone, and due to the lack of a significant   meta  -analytic effect in the direct comparison, a strong claim for compensatory cerebellar activation in PD patients is not supported. Further evidence in larger study and   meta  -analytic samples is required to better elucidate this issue. \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nUsing a less conservative threshold, we found that, during social tasks, healthy control subjects displayed a trend towards significant activation in the left IPL, alongside the left IPS and the left postcentral gyrus. A trend towards a statistically significant activation increase for HC compared to patients with PD in the left IPL and IPS also emerged in the between-group analysis. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging experiments suggested that the parietal cortex is involved in the processing of social and emotional information in HC ( ). A causal role for the parietal cortex in social perception was also supported by the results of a   meta  -analysis on brain lesion studies ( ). \n\nIt has been shown that visual processing of facial emotional expressions leads to activations in the IPL ( ,  ). The IPS seems to support the adaptive online control of actions ( ,  ) and is involved in action goal coding ( ). Both action perception and action execution are represented in the IPS ( ). Moreover, the IPS is also involved in face processing ( ) and emotion differentiation ( ). All these socio-emotional processes are supported by the basic mirror neuron mechanisms, which allow to respond to social stimuli of conspecifics with an internal brain representation of their movements and actions ( ). \n\nOur results, although only trendwise, thus confirm the hypothesis of an impairment of the mirror neuron resonance system in patients with PD. Lesions of IPL/IPS extending to the somatosensory areas and supramarginal gyrus can lead to social perception deficits ( ). Furthermore, decreased activation and connectivity patterns between the IPL, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in patients with PD were shown during both resting state conditions ( ) and motor tasks ( ), probably reflecting an impairment in the neural systems supporting motor preparation and initiation ( ). The posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) represents the visual input of the human mirror neuron system, from pSTS the information is forwarded to the parietal cortex ( ). Finally, information is forwarded to the inferior frontal gyrus and the ventral premotor cortex, where action goals are coded ( ). Thus, deactivation of mirror neuron areas in the parietal cortex may be one reason for a deficit in the neural mechanism for social resonance, and may consequently be a putative basis for impaired social perception in PD ( ; see also  ). However, considering that our results only represent a statistical trend, more solid evidence is required to support this interpretation. \n\n\n### Possible confounding variables \n  \nConsidering variability of both clinical conditions and clinical treatment (e.g., levodopa equivalent daily dose) between different patients with PD, it would be important to consider these aspects when investigating the neural outcomes of PD. Particularly, the type of dopaminergic treatment, the use of deep brain stimulation, and a predominant left side motor symptom onset seem to have a noticeable effect on social processing in PD (e.g.,  ). Unfortunately, considering the low number of studies focused on social perception on PD, we were not able to contrast studies with different medication conditions, nor to select only studies using a specific medication condition. Moreover, even within an individual study there can be heterogeneity in the medication status of PD patients (e.g.,  ). Most of the studies included in our   meta  -analysis did not report the side of motor symptom onset, nor information regarding treatment with deep brain stimulation. This is probably why also in other   meta  -analyses on PD these aspects were not considered (e.g.,  ). The lack of control for these clinical variables, however, represents a limitation of our results. For clarity, we provide a table in the   with information pertaining to these clinical aspects for each study (  Table S1  ). \n\n\n### Conclusion and future directions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results suggest that social perception deficits in PD patients involve the left basal ganglia, and we also found a trend toward a decreased activity in the mirror system areas. An important question for future research regards the putative compensatory role of the posterior cerebellum in PD. \n\nAt a practical level, our results can guide the design and the implementation of neuro-psychological training programs for PD patients, supporting the crosstalk between basic scientists and clinical researchers ( ). Action observation training (AOT) in PD patients enhanced the execution of spontaneous movements ( ,  ), and observing and performing a target movement simultaneously aids patient performance ( ). This could happen since these trainings lead to a stronger activation of the brain network that subtends motor control ( ), which is minimally damaged in the first stages of PD (e.g.,  ). This stronger activation may cause a brain system reinforcement, compensating the alterations in motor execution areas. Based on our results, it might be useful to add social stimuli to this training (e.g., images or video clips depicting emotional faces, interacting people, social gestures), promoting the observation and imitation of social behavior, so that PD patients could counteract the deterioration of simulation systems underlying social perception. Critically, the effects of this type of social training may be further enhanced by combining the behavioral approach with posterior cerebellar non-invasive stimulation to boost the compensatory effect of cerebellum activity (e.g.,  ,  ; see also   for a review on the possible benefit in using non-invasive brain stimulation in PD). \n\n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 9112018, "text_md5": "9bddd5eb3809ab85493c95067f8d1519", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 100], "journal": [101, 116], "publication_year": [118, 122], "title": [133, 215], "keywords": [229, 336], "abstract": [349, 2030], "body": [2039, 37734]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35569229, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2022.103031", "pmcid": "9112018", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9112018", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9112018"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9112018\">9112018</a>", "list_title": "PMC9112018  Action and emotion perception in Parkinson\u2019s disease: A neuroimaging meta-analysis"}

Since different cognitive resources are needed in the two subcomponents of IC (cognitive inhibition and response inhibition), regions of the brain are differentially activated. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there is a distinct age-related activation pattern in these two subcomponents. A total of 278 fMRI articles were included in the current analysis. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to provide data on brain activation under each subcomponent of IC. Contrast analyses were conducted to capture the distinct activated brain regions for the two subcomponents, whereas meta-regression analyses were performed to identify brain regions with distinct age-related activation patterns in the two subcomponents of IC. The results showed that the right inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral insula were activated during the two IC subcomponents. Contrast analyses revealed stronger activation in the superior parietal lobule during cognitive inhibition, whereas stronger activation during response inhibition was observed primarily in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, and angular gyrus. Furthermore, regression analyses showed that activation of the left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, and left superior parietal lobule increased and decreased with age during cognitive inhibition and response inhibition, respectively. The results showed distinct activation patterns of aging for the two subcomponents of IC, which may be related to the differential cognitive resources recruited. These findings may help to enhance knowledge of age-related changes in the activation patterns of IC. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress unwanted actions that are not appropriate for the current situation or to resist distractions and adapt to conflicting situations ( ;  ;  ). By doing so, humans can selectively attend to task-relevant information and engage in goal-directed rather than habitual actions, as well as staying away from dangerous environments. Dysfunctional inhibitory control is considered to be one of the symptoms of various disorders, including affective and anxiety disorders ( ), eating disorders ( ), learning difficulties ( ), and substance abuse ( ). More importantly, it is thought to be an essential cause of cognitive function decline in the aging brain ( ). Better understanding of the developmental trajectory of inhibitory control and its neural correlates across the healthy lifespan could not only help to identify the pivotal time point at which inhibitory control and related neural networks decline over the lifespan but will also help to formulate an early intervention strategy for people who are at risk of inhibitory control deficits. \n\n### Behavioral and neural developmental trajectory of inhibitory control \n  \nIn the recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies examining the behavioral and neural developmental trajectory of inhibitory control across the lifespan (refer to  ). However, there is a lack of agreement in the results of existing studies examining the behavioral developmental trajectory of inhibitory control. For example, some studies have suggested a steady increase in inhibitory control from adolescence to adulthood ( ;  ), and some studies revealed a lack of improvement in inhibitory control from adolescence to adulthood ( ;  ;  ), while other studies have found that inhibitory control develops until adolescence and then declines slightly from young adulthood to old age ( ;  ). \n\nIn neuroimaging research examining the neural developmental trajectory of inhibitory control, the results are also not consistent. Increased frontal activation in adults compared with children has been observed in some fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ).   reported that superior performance in adults was paralleled by increased activation in a network comprising prefrontal and parietal cortical regions in cognitive inhibition. Moreover,   showed increased activation with age during response inhibition in the right inferior frontal cortex and supplementary motor area. Using a Go/NoGo task,   reported a significant positive linear activation associated with age in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices, which means that activation in these regions during response inhibition increased with age. However, other neuroimaging studies have reported stronger activation during cognitive inhibition in the frontal and parietal lobes in children and adolescents aged 9\u201312 years compared with adults aged 20\u201330 years ( ).   reported stronger activation in the bilateral ventral prefrontal cortex, right parietal lobe, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for children than adults during a response inhibition task. \n\nPrevious meta-analyses have also compared brain activation across different age groups to explore the age effect of brain activation during the process of inhibitory control ( ;  ). For example,   reported that activation during inhibition occurred predominantly in the right prefrontal and parietal regions in participants older than the young adult group; in their study, the researchers compared data collected from four different age groups (18\u201331 years for young adults, 33\u201355 years for middle-aged adults, 62\u201372 years for young elderly, and 73\u201378 years for elderly). Moreover,  , in a study including individuals aged 18\u201325 years for young adults and 49\u201383 years for older adults, reported decreased activation in the anterior cingulate and increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the older group but not in the younger group. The above studies, which had a lack of agreement on the developmental patterns of behavioral performance and neural activation during inhibitory control, suggest that the developmental patterns of inhibitory control with aging need to be further clarified. \n\nThe lack of agreement in the existing studies on the behavioral and neural developmental trajectory of inhibitory control across the lifespan may be due to studies including samples with limited age ranges or the fact that few existing studies or theories have systematically differentiated age-related changes in different inhibitory control tasks. For example,   recruited 160 participants aged 10\u201323 years to investigate the developmental patterns of inhibitory control and the degree of specificity of inhibitory control in children, adolescents, and adults (not including older adults), whereas   only recruited 98 individuals aged 8\u201327 years in their study. Similarly,   only included 90 participants aged 12\u201318 years in their study, which revealed a lack of improvement in inhibitory control from adolescence to adulthood, and did not include younger children or older adults as participants. Furthermore,   carried out a longitudinal study including a total of 123 individuals spanning the age range of 9\u201326 years. \n\nMost current studies on the behavioral and neural developmental trajectory of inhibitory control across the lifespan include only a single type of inhibitory control task ( ;  ;  ). For example,   reported that in a stop signal task, the stop signal reaction time of older adults was slower than that observed in younger adults, suggesting an age-related deficit in inhibitory control in the older population, whereas   reported that children had more errors and slower reaction times compared to adults in a selective attention task. Similarly,   found that aging affected the ability to cancel a strong response in a stop signal task but did not affect performance in a Stroop task. Notably,   suggested that working memory capacity, as a core component of executive function, was constrained by the resources demanded in different working memory tasks and declined across the adult lifespan. The above studies suggest that since inhibitory control is also a subcomponent of executive function ( ), and different developmental trajectories of inhibitory control across the lifespan may also be impacted by varying degrees of task demand ( ). Therefore, there is a critical need to clarify the similarities and differences between different inhibitory control tasks ( ;  ;  ) and further explore the developmental trajectory of inhibitory control through a wider age range under the framework of different subcomponents of inhibitory control. \n\n\n### Subcomponents of inhibitory control and its neural correlates \n  \nIn the recent times, an increasing number of studies have not only focused on explaining the diversity, scope, and range of inhibitory control functions, but have explored the intrinsic variability of different components of inhibitory control. These studies have suggested that inhibitory control is not a unitary construct, but is the one which can be further differentiated into different subcomponents ( ;  ;  ). For example, by capturing the temporal dynamics in the processes of inhibitory control,   described a dual mechanism of control (DMC) framework, which hypothesized that inhibitory control operates through two distinct modes\u2014proactive control and reactive control\u2014depending on the time that the action was withheld. Proactive inhibition is considered as a \u201ctop-down\u201d model of inhibitory control, which actively maintains goal-relevant information and facilitates the suppression of the coming action before the occurrence of cognitive events ( ). In contrast, reactive inhibition is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d form of control and is thought to be a stopping mechanism triggered by an already-initiated motor response ( ;  ). Experimental evidence from neuroimaging studies shows partially overlapping regions such as the frontoparietal circuit activated in the processes of both reactive and proactive inhibitions, which may reflect cognitive function or brain network sharing between these two inhibitory control processes ( ;  ). These studies suggest that dual mechanisms of control, namely, proactive inhibition and reactive inhibition, may not be sensitive to the distinct cognitive function developmental trajectory. \n\nTo differentiate the cognitive process during inhibitory control, inhibitory control can also be classified into two subcomponents\u2014cognitive and response inhibitions\u2014depending on the cognitive process of different inhibition targets in inhibitory control tasks ( ). Cognitive inhibition involves the suppression of competing cognitive processing to solve relevant problems, whereas response inhibition involves the suppression of a prepotent response or an already-initiated action to perform a different, more context-appropriate response ( ;  ). The dissociation of cognitive inhibition and response inhibition may provide useful information to further understand different manifestations of inhibitory dysfunction, which will greatly benefit clinical research. \n\nDifferences between inhibition difficulties and complexity of the two types of inhibition tasks might originate from the differences in cognitive resources recruited in these subcomponents of inhibitory control tasks ( ).   used a multicomponent modeling approach and showed that the control of response-related interference is not a unitary construct and that cognitive interference can be separated from response inhibition.   showed no significant correlations or commonalities between different inhibition tasks such as Stroop, Go/NoGo, and stop signal tasks, suggesting that different inhibitory control tasks primarily assess different aspects of inhibition processes and involve different brain system or neural mechanisms. This may be attributed to the variety of inhibitory control tasks with different demands of cognitive resources, the latter of which may eventually result in the differences in inhibition behavioral performance with increasing age across the healthy lifespan. \n\nCognitive inhibition can be captured by paradigms including the Stroop, Flanker, and Simon and stimulus response compatibility (SRC) ( ;  ;  ). In the Stroop or Flanker tasks, participants are required to suppress interference due to stimulus competition or irrelevant information and need to resolve a conflicting representation arising from the cognitive level ( ). A measure of cognitive inhibition is thus the difference in reaction time in incompatible compared to compatible or baseline trials ( ). Moreover, response inhibition is usually assessed by tasks such as the antisaccade task, Go/NoGo task, or stop signal task. A measure of response inhibition is the proportion of correctly withheld responses compared to incorrectly withheld actions in a NoGo or antisaccade stimulus, or reaction time in a stop signal task, which may reflect the latency of the inhibition process. \n\nIn line with the findings of behavioral studies regarding cognitive inhibition and response inhibition, studies characterizing the neural correlates of inhibitory control have also found a significant difference in neural correlates between the two components. For example,   demonstrated a stronger activation of the cingulo-opercular network in cognitive inhibition compared to response inhibition, whereas   revealed that cognitive inhibition activated the pre-SMA and parietal regions to a greater extent than response inhibition. More recently, through quantitatively synthesizing the published studies on inhibitory control,   reported stronger activation of the dorsal frontal and parietal lobe in cognitive inhibition tasks compared to stronger activation of the frontostriatal network including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and parietal regions in response inhibition tasks, whereas the left anterior insula was found to be consistently activated in cognitive inhibition and response inhibition. In sum, the findings of distinct inhibitory networks in different subcomponents of inhibitory control provide supporting evidence for the differences in neural correlates between cognitive inhibition and response inhibition. Furthermore,   reported that with an increasing demand of inhibition tasks, further additional brain regions including the frontal and parietal cortices were recruited in older adults. This finding may confirm that age-related distinct brain region activation patterns in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control across the lifespan may originate from the different cognitive demand involved in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control processes; thus, this may reflect the behavioral developmental trajectory of inhibitory control. \n\nIn this study, we investigated how neural activation during the two subcomponents of inhibitory control changes across the healthy lifespan with aging using meta-analytic technology. The study had two aims: that first was to characterize the common or distinct neural correlates in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control and the second was to identify the distinct age-related activation pattern in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control. Since the cognitive resources recruited in the two subcomponents are different, we hypothesized that the activation patterns of inhibitory control may show distinct age-related trajectories in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control, or differential activation patterns may be shown across different age groups in cognitive and response inhibitions. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nFirst, two online citation indexing services\u2014PubMed and Web of Science\u2014were searched. This search used the keywords \u201cfMRI\u201d with \u201cinterference resolution,\u201d \u201caction withholding,\u201d \u201caction cancellation,\u201d \u201cresponse inhibition,\u201d \u201ccognitive inhibition,\u201d \u201cinhibitory control,\u201d \u201cstop signal,\u201d \u201cstopping,\u201d \u201cgo nogo,\u201d \u201caction restraint,\u201d or \u201ccountermanding,\u201d including articles published prior to April 2020, yielding a total of 9,419 articles. After removing duplicates, a total of 7,985 articles were screened. We then compiled 39 eligible articles identified in a previous meta-analysis ( ). The following exclusion criteria were applied to eliminate articles that were not directly relevant to this study: (1) non-original studies (e.g., review, abstract), (2) studies that did not report results either in Talairach or Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) coordinate space, (3) studies with a sample size below five, (4) studies on older adults with dementia, head injury, stroke, or any neurological or other psychiatric disease, (5) pharmacological or training-related studies, unless they conducted a baseline comparison and fulfilled our inclusion criteria, (6) studies with no control group or within-group contrast, (7) studies that used positive or negative stimulation only in inhibition tasks. A total of 278 articles were included in the current meta-analysis.   shows the detailed search and selection procedures. The final dataset was then divided into the two subcomponents of inhibitory control: 51 articles on cognitive inhibition and 227 articles on response inhibition. \n  \nPRISMA flowchart for the identification and eligibility of articles.   N   = number of articles. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nWe extracted the following information from each study: authors, year of publication, sample size, experimental design, paradigms, mean age with the age range, task contrasts, stimulation types, and cluster coordinates in the MNI or Talairach space. \n\n\n### Experiment categorization \n  \n#### Cognitive inhibition \n  \nCognitive inhibition is the inhibitory process of suppression of competing cognitive processing to solve relevant problems ( ). For the cognitive inhibition domain, we included commonly used cognitive interference paradigms ( ): Stroop, Flanker, Simon task, and SRC. We examined the changes in activation between incongruent and neutral or incongruent and congruent conditions to measure straightforward processing of cognitive interference. A total of 51 articles consisting of 54 experiments were included to explore the neural correlates of cognitive inhibition. The characteristics of each study are listed in  . \n\n\n#### Response inhibition \n  \nResponse inhibition is the process of suppression of a prepotent response to perform a different, more context-appropriate response ( ). To measure the response inhibition, we included the classical paradigms, including antisaccade, Go/NoGo, and stop signal tasks, which primarily require the inhibition of prepotent motor responses. Qualified response inhibition experimental contrasts measured the differences in activation between go and no-go or stop conditions. A total of 227 articles comprising 236 contrasts using the antisaccade, Go/NoGo paradigm, or stop signal paradigm were employed to identify the response inhibition-related activation patterns. \n\n\n\n### Multilevel kernel density analysis \n  \nMeta-analyses were performed using the Multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) ( ) toolbox  to identify the brain regions activated during inhibitory control. Peak effect coordinates from each study were convolved with a spherical kernel (  r   = 16 mm) ( ) to generate comparison indicator maps (CIMs), with a value of 1 indicating that \u201cthis study activated near this voxel\u201d and a value of 0 indicating that \u201cthis study did not activate near this voxel.\u201d The CIMs were averaged to yield the proportion of studies in which the activation was observed within 16 mm of each voxel. The family-wise error (FWE) rate was estimated to correct for multiple comparisons (5,000 permutations). \n\nPreviously used meta-analyses, such as the activation likelihood estimate (ALE), count how many peak coordinates are within each voxel divided by the brain regions and compare this to the number expected by chance if the peak coordinates were randomly distributed in the brain. This method is limited by the consequence that the peak coordinates in any single study may overly influence the results from analyses ( ). Using MKDA may overcome this limitation by separating the peaks of each study. In the MKDA method, the null hypothesis is that the n peak coordinates reported in the set of studies to be analyzed are randomly and uniformly distributed throughout the gray matter. Thus, in this study, the meta-analytic results represent common activated regions across studies: regions in which the significant activation was observed in the local neighborhood by more studies than would be expected by chance (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected across the entire brain). Specifically, to characterize brain activation patterns, first, we identified brain regions that showed significant convergence across 278 studies comprising 4,393 foci from 290 contrasts. Then, contrast analyses were conducted to verify the differences in cognitive demand for the two subcomponents of inhibitory control and capture the selectively or preferentially activated brain regions for two subcomponents of inhibitory control: cognitive inhibition vs. response inhibition. All cluster coordinates were analyzed in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard stereotaxic spaces. \n\n\n### Effects of age on subcomponents of inhibitory control \n  \n#### Meta-regression analyses with age \n  \nTo further assess age-related change in activation patterns in the subcomponents of inhibitory control, the effect-size seed-based d mapping (ES-SDM) toolbox (SdmPsiGui-v6.21 from the Seed-based d Mapping project) was used to perform meta-regression analyses because the ES-SDM software can provide accurate results of regression analyses incorporating meta-regression methods. This is achieved by first using peak coordinates and their statistical values to recreate statistical parametric maps and then conducting an image-based meta-analysis ( ). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) in SDM was set at 20 mm ( ) by default to control for false positives and the resulting statistical maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.05 to control for family-wise error rate. We performed two meta-regression analyses in ES-SDM. Data involved in the meta-regression analyses were derived from response inhibition contrasts and cognitive inhibition contrasts separately. Given that different age ranges were reported in the original articles, the age computed in the meta-regression analysis as a continuous variable was determined by the mean age of each sample in the original articles. The results from the two regression analyses were then compared to identify brain regions with distinct age-related activation patterns in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control. \n\n\n#### Meta-analyses across different age groups \n  \nFurther, given that age was computed in the meta-regression analysis as a continuous variable determined by the mean age of each sample in the original articles, the mean age was affected by extreme values, which cannot well represent the age distribution of all subjects in each original study. As mentioned above, to more completely explore the age-related changes in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control within individuals of different ages, we performed additional MKDA analyses as validation analyses. We divided the datasets from all articles included in the current meta-analysis into four age groups: under 18 years for under-aged children, 18\u201335 years for young adults, 35\u201355 years for middle-aged adults, and 55\u201380 years of age for older adults. Then, we performed contrast analyses and computed the differences among all age groups in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control: under-aged children vs. young adults, young adults vs. middle-aged adults, middle-aged adults vs. older adults, under-aged children vs. middle-aged adults, young adults vs. older adults, and under-aged children vs. older adults. \n\n\n\n### Validation analyses \n  \nAdditional validation analyses were performed to reduce the impact of the number of experiments, the different types of inhibition tasks, and the behavioral performance reported in the studies included in the results of the current meta-analysis. \n\nFirst, studies on response inhibition (236 experiments of Go/NoGo and stop signal tasks) included a much larger number of experiments compared to those on cognitive inhibition (54 experiments). To test the effect of the number of experiments, we randomly selected 54 contrasts from the response inhibition data and repeated the MKDA and meta-regression analysis with age as a variable using the same settings. \n\nSecond, leave-one-out analysis was performed to test homogeneity in the cognitive inhibition tasks and response inhibition tasks separately. For the two subcomponents of inhibitory control, we removed each type of inhibition task one at a time: including Flanker, Simon, Stroop, WCST, and other tasks for cognitive inhibition, and tasks including antisaccade, Go/NoGo, and stop signal tasks for response inhibition. MKDA analyses were separately performed on the remaining studies with a total of five activation maps for cognitive inhibition and three activation maps for response inhibition. Then, we pooled the activation maps to obtain the overlapping rate maps for cognitive and response inhibitions, respectively. The overlap rate maps obtained from leave-one-out analysis and the results from MKDA on cognitive or response inhibition were then contrasted to test whether different tasks employed in studies influenced the activation patterns in the subcomponents of inhibitory control. Furthermore, since the meta-analysis results of cognitive inhibition and response inhibition identified different major regions (i.e., insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus), we conducted contrast analyses on the regions identified in the leave-one-out meta-analysis results for cognitive inhibition and response inhibitions separately. \n\nThird, to investigate whether older adults that performed a task similarly to younger adults may show different patterns of activity to older adults who underperformed relative to younger adults, we selected a total of 81 studies which reported task performance with successful inhibition in response inhibition tasks. Then, we performed a meta-regression analysis and several contrast analyses separately. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of all included inhibitory control experiments \n  \nThe MKDA of the 278 studies showed significant activation of clusters in both hemispheres, including the frontal cortex, the angular gyrus, and the supplementary motor area ( ).

Unilateral activations were observed in the right middle frontal gyrus. \n  \nBrain activation in two subcomponents of inhibitory control. \n    \n\n#### Brain activation patterns of response inhibition \n  \nData from response inhibition experiments revealed activations in the right middle frontal gyrus, the right angular gyrus that extended to the middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, the right inferior temporal gyrus, and the left middle cingulate gyrus. In addition, activation areas in both hemispheres were observed in the supplementary motor cortex, middle cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, inferior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus (  and  ). \n\n\n\n### Common and distinct activation patterns in the two subcomponents \n  \nActivation patterns common to the two subcomponents of inhibitory control were derived by conjunction analysis ( ). Regions commonly activated in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control included the following: (1) the supplementary motor cortex, which extended to the middle cingulate cortex and the superior parietal lobule in both hemispheres; (2) the inferior frontal gyrus, which extended to the middle frontal gyrus and insula in both hemispheres; (3) the right superior occipital gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus; and (4) the inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus in both hemispheres. \n  \nCommon and distinct activation regions between two subcomponents.   (A)   Common areas between cognitive inhibition and response inhibition.   (B)   Higher activation in cognitive inhibition than response inhibition.   (C)   Higher activation in response inhibition than cognitive inhibition. The color bar represents the maximum proportion of studies exhibiting the effect at the peak density weighted by sample size (P). \n  \nContrast analyses of cognitive inhibition and response inhibition revealed that significantly different regions were activated in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control. Specifically, compared to response inhibition, a higher level of activation was found during cognitive inhibition in the left superior parietal lobule (  and  ). On the other hand, a higher level of activation during response inhibition compared to cognitive inhibition occurred in the frontal cortex including the bilateral insula and inferior frontal gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the right superior frontal gyrus, which extended to the bilateral putamen (  and  ). Regions in the right middle temporal gyrus and right angular gyrus also showed a higher level of activation during response inhibition than in cognitive inhibition. \n  \nBrain activation differences between cognitive inhibition and response inhibition. \n    \n\n### Age-related brain activation patterns of each component \n  \n#### Age-related change in the activation patterns in cognitive inhibition \n  \nIn the cognitive inhibition tasks, results from the meta-regression analysis with age as a continuous variable across all studies showed a positive association with clusters in the followings: (1) the middle cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula in both hemispheres; (2) the angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor cortex in the left hemisphere. In addition, a negative association between age and clusters was found in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, right angular gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus ( ). \n  \nActivation maps displaying whole brain regression analysis in cognitive inhibition and response inhibition with age as a covariate.   (A)   Correlation with age with clusters in cognitive inhibition.   (B)   Correlation with age with clusters in response inhibition. Clusters associated with activity in older adults during inhibitory control are displayed in red, whereas clusters associated with activity during inhibitory control among younger adults are displayed in blue. CI Pos: Regions associated with increased activity with aging during cognitive inhibition; RI Neg: Regions associated with decreased activity with aging during response inhibition; Overlap: Regions displayed in yellow derived from overlapping results from regression analyses in two subcomponents with age, meaning a distinct correlation with age in these regions in two subcomponents of inhibitory control. \n  \n\n#### Age-related change in the activation patterns in response inhibition \n  \nActivation in the response inhibition tasks showed significant positive correlations with age in the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, and bilateral middle cingulate cortex, whereas a negative correlation with age was found in the followings: (1) the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, hippocampus, and superior parietal lobule in the left hemisphere and (2) the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus in the right hemisphere ( ). \n\n\n#### Distinct activation patterns with age in subcomponents of inhibitory control \n  \nTo characterize distinct brain regions with age-related changes in activation patterns in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control, we overlapped the results from regression analyses in the two subcomponents with age and found different age-related activation patterns in the subcomponents ( ). Activation of inhibitory regions including the left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, and left superior parietal lobule showed a positive correlation with age in the cognitive inhibition tasks, but a negative association with age in the response inhibition tasks. \n\n\n\n### Brain activation patterns across different age groups for each component \n  \n#### Brain activation patterns across different age groups for cognitive inhibition \n  \nContrast analyses among different age groups for cognitive inhibition showed that regions with significantly higher levels of activation in adults (including young, middle-aged, and older adults) than under-aged children were located in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, and left supplementary motor area ( ). Compared to young adults, the right insula and left middle frontal gyrus were activated at a significantly lower level in under-aged children and middle-aged adults ( ).

Compared to middle-aged adults, the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule were activated at a significantly higher level in young adults ( ), whereas a lower level of activation could be detected in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, and left middle cingulate cortex in older adults than middle-aged adults ( ). Further details are reported in  . \n\n\n\n### Validation analysis \n  \nThe evaluation of the number of experiments contrasting the two subcomponents showed no significant differences between the real contrasts and the randomly selected 54 experiments for response inhibition. The activated brain areas are reported in   and  . \n\nThe results from leave-one-out analysis (e.g., leaving out Stroop tasks from cognitive inhibition tasks) were highly consistent with the results of brain activation patterns in each component of inhibitory control derived from MKDA analyses. Further details are reported in  ,   and  . \n\nMeta-regression and contrast analyses on successful inhibition showed a similar activation pattern of brain regions including the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, inferior parietal lobule, insula, angular gyrus, middle cingulate cortex, and occipital gyrus as compared to current MKDA analyses on response inhibition. The activated brain areas and activation maps are reported in   and  ,  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nApplying MKDA and ES-SDM allowed the current meta-analysis to characterize the neural correlates and age-related effects in different subcomponents of inhibitory control. We observed brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, middle cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal gyrus being activated in the two subcomponents. Contrast analyses conducted to elucidate the distinct neural substrates for each subcomponent revealed that relative to response inhibition, cognitive inhibition produced stronger activation in the left superior parietal lobule, whereas response inhibition primarily recruited the right inferior frontal gyrus, insula, middle temporal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Importantly, by performing a meta-regression analysis with age as a continuous variable, we found distinct age-related activation patterns in different subcomponents of inhibitory control in brain regions including the left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, and bilateral insula. Overall, our results indicated common and distinct neural correlates and distinct age-related activation patterns in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control. \n\n### Common neural activation in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control \n  \nThe MKDA results showed that brain regions including the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, middle cingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule were activated by both inhibition subcomponents. Therefore, this suggests that the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, middle cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule played the core roles in inhibitory control ( ;  ), which is in line with the findings of previous studies ( ;  ;  ). Moreover,   reported the activation of domain-oriented regions within the inferior frontal gyrus and conflict-detecting regions within the middle cingulate cortex in both inhibition subcomponents, which can be interpreted as showing that either the cognitive inhibition process or response inhibition process involves the process of spatial orientation and conflict detection ( ). \n\nThe main clusters of activation in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control were observed in the followings: (1) the inferior frontal gyrus extending to the insula and (2) the middle cingulate cortex and the superior parietal lobule. The inferior frontal gyrus is known to engage in the process of inhibiting automatic but irrelevant actions while activating task-relevant responses at the same time ( ;  ). Moreover, the activation of the inferior frontal gyrus during detecting changes in stimulus features has also been observed ( ). Although the key role of the inferior frontal gyrus in processes of inhibitory control has been reported in a large number of previous studies ( ;  ), whether the right and left inferior frontal gyrus play different roles in this process is still subjected to debate. For example,   found that patients with lesions in the right inferior frontal gyrus showed longer stop signal reaction times in stop signal tasks compared with the control group, which might strongly support inhibitory control being executed solely by the right inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely,   found that patients with damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus and insula made more errors than did controls in a Go/NoGo task, which demonstrated that the left inferior frontal gyrus is critical for suppressing prepotent responses. In contrast, this study found that the bilateral inferior frontal gyri were activated during the process of the two subcomponents of inhibitory control. A potential explanation for this is that this study is a meta-analysis study which combined studies using different tasks and stimulus materials. The literature on frontal gyrus function shows that the left inferior frontal gyrus plays a critical role in semantic selection ( ), resolution of interference in semantic memory ( ), and conflicts from representations between incompatible word materials ( ) during the processes of inhibitory control. Thus, activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus reported by   may partly be due to the letter stimuli used in the Go/NoGo task. In line with this speculatory explanation, the literature included in the current study contained a sufficient number of different paradigms (such as Stroop, Simon, GNG, and SST) and experimental materials (such as picture, arrow, word, letter, sound; see  ), which might partially explain the common activation of the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus during the two subcomponents of inhibitory control reported in the current research. \n\nThe anterior insula has been considered as the center that controls brain activity across different tasks and stimulus modalities and regulates inhibitory control mechanisms (W.  ).   reported a positive correlation between neural activity in the anterior insula and task performance in different inhibitory control tasks. One explanation for this positive correlation is that regions including the anterior insula implement a regulating process that increases with greater input conflict ( ). Regarding the middle cingulate cortex, studies have revealed that the middle cingulate cortex is the key region for conflict detection in information processing, reallocation of attention resources, and the formation of corresponding actions ( ). When participants were required to perform a dual task, such as the Stroop task, stronger middle cingulate cortex activation could be observed ( ,  ;  ). Based on the previous findings and the results on the common regions engaged in different inhibitory control tasks, we propose that the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, superior parietal lobule, and middle cingulate cortex may comprise the core neural network of the inhibitory control system. \n\nAdditionally, our research found that the right superior occipital gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus were commonly activated in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control, which is in line with the results from previous studies and meta-analyses ( ;  ). Interestingly,   indicated that the effect of hyperactivation in the occipital cortex was only present in successful but not in unsuccessful stop trials, which is consistent with the results from validation analyses on successful inhibition contrasts in the current meta-analysis. We speculate that common activation in occipital areas across different types of inhibitory control tasks presumably reflects enhanced visual attention to the inhibition stimuli or conflict interference, considering that the inhibitory control task stimulation used in most of the studies included in our meta-analyses was presented in visual form (refer to  ). Meanwhile, this enhanced activation in the occipital areas may be functionally related to successful inhibitory control, which may be explained by the fact that enhanced visual attention may facilitate the detection of inhibitory signals and thereby contribute to successful inhibitory control. \n\n\n### Distinct neural activation in the two subcomponents of inhibitory control \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, the inhibitory control paradigms classified as cognitive inhibition required conflict resolution and inhibition of response tendencies for successful responding ( ). When performing cognitive inhibition tasks (i.e., Stroop, Simon, and Flanker tasks), participants need to actively reorient attention away from a task-relevant stimulus location or feature and then select and initiate an adequate response. Reorienting of attention mainly involves the presupplementary motor area and the superior parietal lobule. The superior parietal lobule plays an essential role in facilitating attention reallocation to characteristics of stimuli and then re-directing attention. Therefore, the significantly stronger activation in the left superior parietal lobule observed in cognitive inhibition compared to response inhibition in the current contrast analysis indicates a higher level of attention reallocation or requirement when performing cognitive inhibition tasks. This thus supports cognitive inhibition depending largely on the inhibition processes of a predominant mental set regulated by goals and conflicts ( ). \n\nIn contrast, for response inhibition, the Go/NoGo and stop signal tasks encompass future action selection and inhibition of a predominant response tendency or an ongoing response, respectively. As mentioned above, the inferior frontal gyrus plays an inhibitory role in resolving conflicts during response execution, and the anterior insula is involved in the regulating process of response inhibition. Thus, there were more activated regions in response inhibition than cognitive inhibition, primarily located in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula. The distinctiveness of response and cognitive inhibition, we suggest, may partly be due to the different cognitive demands in these inhibitory control tasks. Participants are required to resolve conflicts and to involve more sensory or stimulus-related neural activity in cognitive inhibition tasks, whereas the demand for inhibitory control may further increase in response inhibition tasks, which require inhibiting a predominant tendency or stopping of already-initiated actions. Furthermore, these tasks differ in terms of task-related complexity. Suppressing a response tendency or canceling an ongoing action might increase the inhibitory demand as compared to suppressing interference due to irrelevant information or resolving conflicts, as is the case in cognitive inhibition tasks ( ). As the engagement of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and insula play the core roles in the process of inhibitory control, activation in these regions was observed to increase with the increasing demands of inhibitory control tasks in response inhibition. \n\nInterestingly, results from contrast analyses of cognitive inhibition and response inhibition showed a predominantly lateralized differential activation between response inhibition and cognitive inhibition. We hypothesized that the underlying reason may be the different types of stimuli (e.g., letter, word, arrow, and picture) materials used in inhibitory control tasks. By compiling a list of all types of stimulation used in the included literature (refer to  ), we found that more letter-related or text-related stimuli were used in cognitive inhibition tasks, especially the Stroop task, as compared to response inhibition tasks, whereas stimuli including arrows, pictures, or dots were more frequently used in response inhibition tasks. This less verbal nature of the stimuli used in response inhibition tasks compared to cognitive inhibition tasks may ultimately reflect the right-lateralized hyperactivation involved in response inhibition, which is not present in cognitive inhibition. \n\n\n### Age-related changes in activation in subcomponents of inhibitory control \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we observed neither a completely coherent increase nor a decrease in the inhibitory network with increasing age in the two subcomponents. In the cognitive inhibition tasks, activation showed a positive association with age in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, superior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus. The results from contrast analyses among different age groups also showed that compared to under-aged children, activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and insula was stronger in adult groups. These age-related changes fit with the existing literature showing that prefrontal regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus, become more active with aging ( ). A previous investigation of neural recruitment involved in cognitive inhibition in children aged 5\u201310 years reported a higher level of activation in incongruent compared with congruent trials in a network of brain regions supporting cognitive inhibition, including the frontal gyrus and parietal cortex, whereas the activation in the anterior cingulate cortex for incongruent relative to congruent trials decreased with aging ( ).   argued that as anterior cingulate cortex plays a specific role in the neural development of cognitive conflict detection and resolution, the decreased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and general improvement in Simon task performance with aging may suggest that neural recruitment during the process of cognitive inhibition becomes more efficient with aging, which may be related to inhibitory control-related cortical thinning. Moreover, increased activation of task-related regions in the frontal and parietal cortices may reflect the cognitive function underlying cognitive inhibition tasks in younger children developing early but not being fully developed, which means that younger children need to recruit more inhibition-relevant brain regions in the frontal and parietal cortices to improve their performance in cognitive inhibition tasks. Similarly, older adults increasingly recruit additional prefrontal regions to compensate for age-related decline in brain structure and function in cognitive inhibition tasks ( ). Meanwhile,   revealed compensational activation in the left prefrontal cortex during cognitive inhibition. These results may support our assumption that a simple cognitive inhibition task requires sufficient functional compensation in the prefrontal regions recruited with aging. \n\nA different pattern of functional age-related changes was found in the response inhibition tasks. We found the activation of the response inhibitory network, including the left anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, insula, left superior parietal lobule, and right superior frontal gyrus, was negatively correlated with age. Contrast analyses also showed a linear decline with increasing age in the activation of brain regions including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, insula, middle cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule when performing response inhibition tasks. These seemingly differential results might also be explained by the differences in the inhibition processes involved. \n\nIn line with a previous study ( ), the current findings show that the aging brain fails to recruit additional inhibitory regions with increasing inhibitory demand and a resource ceiling is reached. With increasing task demand, the immaturity of the frontoparietal regions in younger children is associated with an inability to recruit additional inhibition-related brain regions during response inhibition tasks to maintain task performance ( ), whereas relative hypoactivation in both the core and expanded inhibitory networks in older adults may further represent a limitation of abilities for flexibly recruiting additional inhibitory networks ( ;  ).   pointed out that the flexibility of the cortical regions becomes limited in older adults with the number of conflicts increasing. It is important to note that the above-mentioned theories have partly been based on the studies investigating age-related differences in working memory.   reported differential changes in the activation patterns for the working memory with different cognitive loads and inhibitions with age. Similarly,   showed different activation patterns in the prefrontal regions during inhibition with medium and low inhibition resource demand. Our results and those of these studies indicate that inhibition tasks with high demand might result in limited allocation of cognitive resources in older adults, which can be reflected in declined performance associated with a lower activation of inhibitory networks ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Implications and future outlook \n  \nSeveral neuroimaging studies have contributed greatly to enhancing our knowledge of the neural correlates of subcomponents of inhibitory control or age-related change in the activation in the two subcomponents ( ;  ;  ). However, these studies are limited because of their focus on a restricted age range ( ,  ), their inclusion of a single subcomponent of inhibitory control ( ;  ;  ), or their use of a small sample size ( ). For example,   included only 11 studies in their meta-analysis. It has been argued that to ensure the replicability of a meta-analysis, it should include at least 20 studies ( ), as otherwise, the conclusions may be questionable. Moreover,   conducted a study on activity and connectivity differences underlying inhibitory control across the adult lifespan using only response inhibition tasks, including Go/NoGo and stop signal tasks.   reported that unique neural activity was associated with different inhibitory control tasks, but the age-related effects on different types of inhibitory control tasks were unknown. Our meta-analysis addressed these limitations and provided an updated review; thus, our understanding on changes in the neural correlates underlying inhibitory control with aging has been further advanced. \n\nThrough synthesizing data from different subcomponents, we found that brain regions including the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula, as well as regions including the middle cingulate cortex and supplementary motor cortex, were consistently activated across all inhibition tasks. This finding may suggest that these brain areas are core inhibitory control regions. Meanwhile, different age-related changes in the activation between the subcomponents of inhibitory control could be observed. Functional reorganization of the aging brain in different inhibitory control tasks showed a complex pattern of increase and decline: the corresponding cognitive inhibition tasks required older adults to increasingly recruit the core inhibitory network and additional inhibitory regions, such as the frontal regions and bilateral insula. However, a contrary pattern of age-related decline in the inhibitory network including prefrontal areas and middle cingulate cortex was shown during the process of response inhibition. The current results suggest that these differences might result from the increasing demands on inhibitory function from cognitive inhibition to response inhibition. Furthermore, age-related increased activation of additional inhibitory networks was limited. When the task demand exceeded the older adults\u2019 capacity, activation in the inhibitory network decreased clearly. These findings are of significance for the understanding of the neuro-developmental mechanisms of inhibitory control and may provide insights into inhibitory control deficits in clinical settings. \n\nAs mentioned above, common and distinct activation patterns are involved in the processes of proactive and reactive inhibition, and age-related changes in activation patterns in proactive and reactive inhibition have been investigated. Experimental evidence from neuroimaging studies supports a right-lateralized frontoparietal circuit being widely recruited through the reactive inhibition process ( ;  ). In addition, studies currently available on brain substrates of the proactive inhibition process suggest that proactive inhibition seems to rely on a wide network including the presupplementary motor area, right inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal cortex ( ;  ). Moreover,   explored whether age-related neurocognitive deficits in inhibitory control reflect impairments in the proactive inhibition process or reactive inhibition process; they reported that relative to young adults, older adults exhibited impaired reactive inhibition and proactive slowing in the left frontal cortex and cerebellum. Similarly,   found that with advancing age, the patterns of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and motor cortex showed a clear age effect on both proactive and reactive inhibitions. The data collected in the current meta-analysis from stop signal tasks and Go/NoGo tasks to assess response inhibition drew more on proactive than reactive inhibition for suppressing prepotent responses. Although previous studies have not reported a distinct age-related activation pattern of inhibitory control in proactive and reactive inhibitions, the division of inhibitory control in the two subcomponents of cognitive inhibition and response inhibition found in this study is a robust finding on differential age-related activation patterns. However, the heterogeneity of the response inhibition tasks should still be a point of concern for future research. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nWe acknowledge that the current study still has some limitations. First, we note that a potential limitation in meta-analysis methods in general is that any meta-analysis method is prone to publication bias; in this study, we only considered the results available in the published literature and original studies which reported coordinates. Moreover, we could not control the statistical methods used in original articles for thresholding the data. There is an emerging trend to store unthresholded statistical maps, which will allow image-based meta-analyses to be performed in the future studies ( ). \n\nThe second limitation relates to the bias of employing different tasks for measuring the components of inhibitory control and including studies using a variety of stimulation types. Specifically, our meta-analysis adopted a mixture of inhibitory control tasks as different subcomponents of inhibitory control, such as the Stroop, Simon, and Flanker tasks used to capture cognitive inhibition and the GNG, stop signal task, and antisaccade tasks to capture response inhibition, which consequently increased the heterogeneity of the study designs. Leave-one-out analysis was performed as validation analysis to test homogeneity in cognitive inhibition and response inhibition separately. The results from leave-one-out analysis were consistent with the results of brain activation patterns in each component of inhibitory control from the MKDA analyses and the details are reported in  ,   and  . Nevertheless, future meta-analyses including additional studies with positive or negative stimulations are needed. \n\nThird, considering that task difficulty and behavioral performance in different inhibition tasks may influence age-related brain activity in different individuals, and not all studies included in the current meta-analysis reported behavioral performance for each participant or task difficulty, we selected a total of 81 studies which reported task performance with successful inhibition in response inhibition tasks. Then, we performed a meta-regression analysis and several contrast analyses separately. The results (refer  ,   and  ,  ) were consistent with the current research, which may confirm the reliability and stability of the current research to a certain extent. However, further considering the study-level task difficulty or behavioral performance reported in each study included in the research is still critical for future meta-analysis. \n\nFourth, the findings from this study are of significance for the understanding of the neuro-developmental mechanisms of inhibitory control and may provide insights into cognitive health in older adults. However, cognitive health is affected not only by physiological factors such as age, but also by socio-demographic factors; particularly significant is educational attainment. Understanding the links between education and cognitive health or cognitive aging could improve the cognitive prognoses and offer clues about the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline that can be targeted by interventions. Previous studies found that a better level of education might affect cognitive ability in older adults and attenuate aging-related decline in cognition functions ( ;  ). This may suggest that educational attainment can improve individual behavioral performance in inhibitory control tasks with aging and affect age-related patterns of brain activation during different subcomponents of inhibitory control. Thus, it is critical in the future research to include the level of education as an influencing factor to explore the commonalities or specificity of behavioral performance and age-related patterns of brain activation in inhibitory control tasks between groups with different levels of educational attainment. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we examined the neural correlates of subcomponents of inhibitory control and the difference in age-related changes in activation between the subcomponents. Activation of the middle cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and anterior insula was common across the different inhibition processes, which revealed that these regions are the core neural system engaged in inhibitory control. On the other hand, differences in the activation patterns of subcomponents of inhibitory control with aging showed a complex pattern in the functional reorganization of the aging brain. Specifically, when performing cognitive inhibition tasks, stronger activation of the core inhibition regions was observed in older adults, whereas activation in prefrontal areas in older adults declined during response inhibition tasks. We summarize that these differences may be driven by the different demands between inhibitory control tasks. Aging individuals recruit additional inhibition-related brain regions when performing an inhibitory control task. However, with an increasing demand of inhibition tasks, limited reallocation of cognitive resources in older adults eventually results in a lower level of the activation of inhibitory brain regions in older adults during inhibitory control processes. These results may further enhance our knowledge of age-related changes in the activation patterns of inhibitory control and may provide insights into inhibitory control deficits in clinical settings. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Southern Medical University. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJL: conceptualization, data curation, data analysis, writing the manuscript, reviewing, and editing.

Recent studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural networks subserving verbal fluency functions have yielded divergent results especially with respect to a parcellation of the inferior frontal gyrus for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. We conducted a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on brain activation during the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks involving 28 individual studies with 490 healthy volunteers. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor phonemic as well as for semantic verbal fluency, the most prominent clusters of brain activation were found in the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus (LIFG/MIFG) and the anterior cingulate gyrus. BA 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks, BA 45 and 47 in the processing of phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur comparison of brain activation during the execution of either phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks revealed evidence for spatially different activation in BA 44, but not other regions of the LIFG/LMFG (BA 9, 45, 47) during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nVerbal fluency constitutes an executive function which is impaired in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Tests of verbal fluency are amongst the most widely used measures to assess executive functioning [ ]. These tests assess the ability to generate words [ ]. The pre-determined categories of verbal fluency tasks can be phonemic or semantic in nature [ ]. In standard clinical versions, subjects are given one minute to generate object names from a given category (semantic fluency) or words beginning with a specific letter (phonemic fluency). \n\nNeuroimaging investigations have shown that verbal fluency relies on the coordinated activity of a number of brain areas, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes of the left hemisphere. Damage to the left frontal lobe, especially to the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has consistently been shown to impair verbal fluency performance [ - ]. Findings from previous studies suggest that phonemic verbal fluency relies on a partially different network of brain regions [ , ]. Studies have shown that frontal lobe damage results in impairment to phonemic fluency, whereas temporal lobe damages rather impair semantic than phonemic verbal fluency [ - ]. Furthermore, a functional dissociation of the LIFG along semantic-phonological domain lines has been suggested [ , , , ]. The anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45, 47) is supposed to be specifically involved in the processing of semantic information whereas the posterior-dorsal LIFG (BA 44) seems to be specifically recruited for the use of phonological information [ , , ]. On the other hand, there is evidence that the same LIFG regions are involved in the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks [ ]. \n\n### Aims of the study \n  \nMeta-analytic methods allow the investigation of shared brain activation across individual studies by quantitatively identifying brain locations that are consistently associated with tasks or cognitive functions of interest. We applied the activation likelihood estimation technique as implemented in the GingerALE software [ - ] in order to study the brain activation during the processing of verbal fluency tasks. \n\nAs previous studies revealed contradictory results on whether the same or different brain regions are involved in the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis separated for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency as well as a subtraction analysis of the activated brain regions in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Based on previous results, we mainly expected cerebral activation during the processing of verbal fluency tasks in the left prefrontal lobe, particularly in the LIFG [ ]. In a second step, we tested the hypothesized functional dissociation of the LIFG along semantic-phonological domain lines and expected that the posterior-dorsal LIFG is primarily involved in the processing of the phonemic verbal fluency tasks and the anterior-ventral LIFG in the processing of the semantic fluency tasks [ , , , ]. \n\nAn important and very influential first systematic review of fMRI studies on verbal fluency [ ] compared the activation patterns of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks within the LIFG. The authors used bootstrap methods to calculate and compare the confidence intervals of the mean x-, y-, and z-coordinates between the two fluency tasks. The results support distinct dorsal-ventral locations for phonemic and semantic processes within the LIFG. Some individual studies comprised in this review included bilingual participants, right and left handed subjects as well as of individuals with right- and left-hemisphere dominance. Some previous fMRI studies suggested that bilingual individuals might have a greater increase in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the LIFG (Brodman Area (BA) 45) than monolinguals [ ]. Furthermore, there is evidence that left-handed individuals demonstrate a reverse speech organization in comparison to right-handed persons [ , ]. Right-hemisphere dominant language individuals on the other hand may exhibit a mirror reverse pattern of activation as compared to left-hemisphere dominant subjects [ ]. In order to reduce variability and avoid issues of mixed language dominance, we restricted our analysis to right handed monolingual subjects. By reducing the inter-individual variation of the participants due to lateralization, handedness, and language background, and the inclusion of new original studies the current meta-analysis set out to replicate, validate and extend the results of the study of Costafreda and colleagues [ ]. Here we applied the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique, which is a widely used, validated, automated and quantitative method for a voxel-wise meta-analysis of neuroimaging foci. Furthermore, we used subtraction analysis in order to directly compare the activation maps of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Included studies and participants \n  \nWe performed a coordinate-based quantitative meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (14-16, available at  ). Results from neuroimaging studies of experiments on phonemic and/or semantic verbal fluency were included. The following inclusion criteria were used to select the studies: i) studies in peer-reviewed journals published in English; ii) use of active task-based functional MRI or PET neuroimaging techniques; iii) the sample consisted of right handed, healthy adult subjects of both sexes with a mean age\u2009\u2264\u200960 years; iv) results were reported using stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates; v) the field of view covered the whole brain. \n\n\n### Search strategy for identification of studies \n  \nPeer-reviewed papers published in English were identified through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycLit, Biological Abstracts Dissertation Abstracts Online and Mental Health Abstracts using the search terms: \u201cverbal fluency, phonemic verbal fluency, semantic verbal fluency, executive functions, and healthy control subjects. These terms were each combined (\u201cAND\u201d) with \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cposition emission tomography\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cPET\u201d or \u201cneuroimaging\u201d in order to identify the relevant functional imaging studies. We subsequently checked the reference sections of the publications that we found through our search, in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed. The search was conducted without any restriction of publication date or language used in the experiment. Direct e-mail communication with some researchers also provided additional data sets. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers (SW, AT) independently conducted the literature search, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials and screened the studies for the above mentioned inclusion criteria. In case of disagreement between the reviewers, the disagreement was resolved by consensus discussion with one senior author of the research team (OT). To achieve a high standard of reporting, we adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the revised Quality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) statement [ ]. \n\n\n### Outcome measures \n  \nAll studies used a block design including alternating blocks of the verbal fluency tasks with a baseline task (phonemic\u2009>\u2009baseline; semantic\u2009>\u2009baseline; for a detailed description of the baseline tasks see Tables\u00a0  and  ). The tasks were presented auditory or visually during the investigation. Subjects were required to generate their responses overtly or covertly (see Tables\u00a0  and  ). In all studies, subjects were asked to generate a word after they had heard an acoustic cue or seen a fixation cross on a monitor. In the phonemic verbal fluency task, subjects had to produce as many words as possible beginning with a specific letter. In the semantic verbal fluency task, a semantic category (e.g., animals or fruits) was presented instead of a letter. The participants were asked to generate an object name from the given category after each acoustic or visual cue. \n  \nStudies included in the meta-analysis \n  \np: phonemic; s: semantic; uc\u2009=\u2009uncorrected; c\u2009=\u2009corrected; these studies seperately investigated the activation for easy and hard verbal fluency tasks, coordinates were included for easy tasks only; these studies seperately investigated the activation of females and males, coordinates were included seperately for males and females; family wise error rate corrected; ROI; Monte Carlo corrected; false discovery rate corrected; 3 foci in females, 12 foci in males; 23 foci in females, 18 foci in males; MNI: Montreal Neurological Institut. \n    \nStimulus material of the included studies \n  \nOutcome measures of the meta-analysis were the activation peaks of healthy control subjects during the processing of phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks. We included only those studies in our analysis, which reported activation as contrasted to a baseline condition in a healthy control group. Theoretical papers and reviews were excluded. Studies reporting combined group results and a region-of-interest analysis or only brain-behavior correlations, or did not report activation foci as 3-D coordinates in stereotactic space were excluded because these studies could not be meaningfully analyzed with ALE. Two studies reported results for men and women separately. In this case, we included the coordinates of males and females as two independent studies. In studies investigating easy and hard letters or categories, we selected the easy condition, because it was more comparable to the stimulus material in the other included studies. \n\n\n### Statistical procedures \n  \nThe X, Y, Z coordinates of every significant peak for all eligible contrasts constituted the input to the meta-analysis. All analyses were performed in the MNI reference space. Coordinates that were reported in Talairach space were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates [ ]. An ALE meta-analysis separated for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency was calculated according to the procedure described by Turkeltaub et al., [ ] and Laird et al., [ ], using the algorithm revised by Eickhoff et al., [ ] and Turkeltaub et al., [ ], which has been implemented in the GingerALE software. The ALE meta-analysis was executed using a random effects model (non-additive HBM, 22) implemented in GingerALE 2.1.1 ( ). A new algorithm was employed which consists of three steps resulting in an ALE map that is unbiased by the number of foci or contrasts included from each study [ , ]. The ALE algorithm delineates in which brain regions the convergence across all included imaging studies is higher than it would be expected if the results were independently distributed [ ]. The three steps of the ALE analyses are as follows: (1) localization uncertainty is modeled for each focus of activity as a Gaussian distribution, the width of which is determined from the number of subjects of the study; (2) taking the union of the study-specific localization probabilities identified for each voxel yields the voxel-wise ALE value; (3) significance is tested using a random-effects method with a null hypothesis that the location of activation in each study is independent from the other studies [ ]. Accordingly generated ALE maps were thresholded at p <0.05 using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction and a minimum clusters size of 100\u00a0mm . For each of the resulting significant clusters, we additionally considered the number of studies that contributed to each. In order to ensure that the reported results represented coherence across multiple experiments, we eliminated ALE clusters and peaks that were based on less than three different studies [ , ]. Visualization of the results was implemented with MRIcron, using the Colin brain template in MNI space. \n\nIn a first step, we performed a ALE meta-analysis of all studies investigating phonemic (studies 1 to 21) verbal fluency tasks. After that we repeated this analysis with all studies using semantic verbal fluency tasks (studies 16-28). Results for phonemic verbal fluency tasks are shown in Table\u00a0 , for semantic fluency tasks in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nRegions with significant activation during phonematic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nN: number of studies reporting at least one activation peak; Coodinates: MNI Space; mm : cubic millimeter; BA: Brodman Area. \n    \nRegions with significant activation during semantic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nN: number of studies reporting at least one activation peak; Coodinates: MNI Space; mm : cubic millimeter; BA: Brodman Area. \n  \nIn a second step we determined the difference between the phonemic and semantic ALE images (Figure\u00a0 ) by a subtraction analysis. The subtraction analysis allows a formal comparison of the difference between the two ALE maps (phonemic vs. semantic). For this purpose we used the thresholded NIfTI images from dataset A (i.e., \u201cphonemic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05), dataset B (i.e., \u201csemantic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05), and a pooled dataset A\u2009+\u2009B (i.e., \u201cphonemic and semantic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05). Regional differences between the phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks were tested by performing the ALE meta-analysis separately for each fluency task and computing the voxel-wise difference between the resultant ALE maps. Subtracting the ALE values calculated from semantic verbal fluency tasks from those calculated from phonemic fluency tasks gives a measure of the difference in convergence in the two maps. \n  \nPRISMA flow chart of the literature search. \n  \nCaution should be exercised when carrying out formal comparisons of ALE meta-analyses when the groups are disparate in total number of foci. In these cases, it is impossible to say with any certainty whether the difference maps reflect activation difference across groups of studies or simply show the effect of one group having a greater number of coordinates [ ]. Because the number of studies and foci in the phonemic verbal fluency task was significantly higher than in the semantic verbal fluency task, the resulting difference in power between the two tasks may affect the results of the subtraction analysis. In order to improve the sensitivity of the subtraction analysis and increase the number of studies and foci included in the semantic verbal fluency map, we added the coordinates of the semantic verbal fluency tasks included in the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency to the semantic part of the subtraction analysis. Thus, data set A (\u201cphonemic\u201d) of the subtraction analysis included studies 1 to 15, data set B (\u201csemantic\u201d) studies 16 to 28 and the pooled data set studies 1 to 28. \n\nA prerequisite of the subtraction analysis of GingerALE is that the number of included studies, subjects and foci of the pooled data set (A\u2009+\u2009B) has to be the exact sum of the number of studies, subjects and foci of data sets A and B. If we had included the coordinates of the phonemic verbal fluency tasks of the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency in the subtraction analysis as well, this prerequisite would have no longer been fulfilled and it had not been possible to execute the subtraction analysis. \n\nA minimum of at least 8 to 10 experiments should be included in an ALE meta-analysis in order to get valid results (Prof. S. Eickhoff, author of GingerALE, personal communication). According to the failure report of GingerALE, the subtraction analysis should include a minimum of at least 15 studies in each data set in order to provide enough statistical power. Thus, the small number of included studies, specifically in the analysis of the semantic verbal fluency map, must be kept in mind when interpreting the results of our subtraction analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe search identified 254 studies which were screened by title and abstract. 196 of these studies had to be excluded because they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. The full text of the remaining 58 studies was scrutinized by two independent reviewers (SW, AT). Thirty of these studies were excluded from analyses: ten studies because the y-, x-, and z-coordinates were not reported, seven because the results were not separated for patients and controls, six studies did not include healthy control subjects, two included identical participants as Krug et al. 2011, one study had no baseline condition and one included a switching verbal fluency task. Finally, 28 studies investigating healthy volunteers were included in our meta-analysis. Fifteen studies assessed phonemic verbal fluency, seven studies semantic verbal fluency, and six studies both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\nAcross the included studies, 490 healthy control subjects (60% men, 40% women) were analyzed. Mean age of the included participants was 30.8\u00a0years (range: 21 \u2013 56.7\u00a0years). The 21 studies assessing phonemic verbal fluency yielded 245 foci inside the MNI space; the 13 studies investigating semantic verbal fluency performance yielded 117 foci. The coordinates of these studies were entered into two separate ALE meta-analyses to test for regional concordance within phonemic or semantic verbal fluency as well as in a subtraction analysis in order to assess significant differences in the brain activation during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. \n\n### Phonemic verbal fluency \n  \nThe search identified 21 studies comprising 23 experiments investigating the brain activation during phonemic verbal fluency tasks, including 307 healthy volunteers. The meta-analysis of the coordinates revealed one cluster covering the LIFG/LMFG (BA 6, 9, 44 & 45) and left insula (BA 13) as well as an additional cluster located in the left and right anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24, 32) as well as one in the right insula and frontal lobe (BA 44, 47). A further cluster revealed activation of the left thalamus. Additionally, we found several brain regions of concordance located in the left precuneus (BA 7) and putamen as well as in the right Claustrum and Caudate Head. \n\n\n### Semantic verbal fluency \n  \nThirteen studies including 292 healthy volunteers were analyzed. The meta-analysis of the coordinates revealed clusters of brain activation in the left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in the left superior (BA 6, 8) and medial frontal gyrus (BA 6) (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). Furthermore, we found brain activation in the LIFG (BA 9, 45) as well as one cluster covering the left claustrum and LIFG (BA 47). Additional clusters comprised the LIFG (BA 47), the left Thalamus and Precuneus (BA 7). \n  \n Shows the significant cluster of brain activation in the processing of verbal fluency, threshold: p <0.05 using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction and a minimum clusters size of 100\u00a0mm3.   Data are shown in neurological convention (R\u2009=\u2009R, L\u2009=\u2009L; R: right; L: left). \n  \n\n### Subtraction analysis \n  \nA subtraction analysis of the experiments using phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks was performed. The phonemic fluency data set included 17 experiments reporting 193 foci (N\u2009=\u2009196), the semantic data set 13 experiments reporting 117 foci (N\u2009=\u2009298) and the pooled data set 30 experiments yielding 310 foci (N\u2009=\u2009494). The subtraction of the phonemic versus semantic verbal fluency map revealed no significant differences in the ALE maps. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we report the results of a coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis of the brain activation during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks in healthy volunteers. The main clusters of brain activation were seen in the left frontal lobe, specifically the IFG, MFG and medial frontal gyrus (BA 6, 9, 44, 45, 47), as well as in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) (BA 24, 33). These results confirm previous studies suggesting that brain regions primarily in the left prefrontal gyrus, particularly in the LIFG and LMFG, are involved in word production and speech processing in verbal fluency tasks [ , - ]. Regarding the ACC, phonemic verbal fluency tasks predominantly activated the left (BA 32, 24) and right ACC (BA 32), semantic verbal fluency tasks only the left ACC (BA 32). This is in line with previous studies suggesting that the cingulate gyrus (BA 32, 24) is activated during word generation and may therefore reflect the attentional demands of verbal fluency tasks [ , , ]. Patients with bilateral anterior cerebral infarction for example often suffer from akinetic mutism and verbal fluency deficits. Furthermore, blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24) increases during the processing of single words or letters [ ]. \n\nThe left parietal precuneus (BA 7) was activated in the processing of phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. The precuneus (BA 7) is involved in phonemic discrimination and working memory [ , , , ] and was repeatedly associated with the processing of phonological information. Furthermore, this region plays a central role in visual attention of stimuli and speech. \n\nFurther cluster of activation included the left and right insula, left Thalamus and Putamen as well as the right Claustrum and Caudate Head. Another cluster of activation was seen in the cerebellum. There is evidence that the (left) sub-lobar insula is involved in speech processing and the execution of verbal fluency tasks [ ]. Specifically the left anterior insula has been suggested to be involved in the articulatory planning of orofacial movements [ ]. A systematic review of Price reports that speech production leads to an increased activation in the cerebellum, the anterior insula as well as in the left Putamen [ ]. The ACC and head of caudate have been found to be involved in word selection. The initiation and execution of movements during speech production increase the activation in the left putamen. The thalamus has also been shown to be involved in the processing of verbal fluency [ ]. \n\n### Brain activation in the processing of phonemic versus semantic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nAs can be seen in Tables\u00a0  and  , Brodman area 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks, whereas BA 9, 45 and 47 were activated in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. The result that BA 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks is in line with previous studies which suggested that the posterior-dorsal LIFG (BA 44) is specifically involved in the processing of phonemic information [ , , ]. Phonemic fluency is most likely triggered by subvocal syllabification that overlaps with processes of inner speech such as motor programming and articulation, as indicated by stronger activations of posterior LIFG (BA 44; Figure\u00a0 , blue) close to adjacent (pre)motor areas [ ]. \n\nContrary to the hypothesis that the anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45, 47) is specifically involved in the processing of semantic information, BA 45 and 47 were activated in the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks. Previous studies also revealed an activation of BA 45 and 47 in the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks [ , , ]. These results are consistent with assumptions that phonological search processes are not exclusively based on phonemic information, but may also rely on semantic facilitation [ ]. A variety of previous studies failed to find evidence for the hypothesis that semantic processing preferentially activates anterior ventro-lateral regions of the PFC when compared to phonological processing [ , - ]. A recent study directly comparing phonemic vs. semantic verbal fluency tasks while controlling for the effects of task demand implies that activity in the anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45) is mainly related to task demand and individual ability [ ]. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that the posterior LIFG is specialized for the use of phonemic material but failed to confirm the hypothesis that the anterior LIFG is specifically involved in the processing of semantic information. \n\nThe subtraction analysis revealed no cluster of significantly greater activation during the processing of phonemic than during semantic verbal fluency tasks. Previous studies suggested that caution should be exercised carrying out formal comparisons of ALE meta-analyses when the two data sets are disparate in the total number of foci. In these cases, it is impossible to say with any certainty whether the difference maps reflect activation difference across groups of studies or simply show the effect of one group having a greater number of coordinates [ ]. In order to improve the sensitivity of the subtraction analysis and increase the number of foci included in the semantic verbal fluency map, we added the coordinates of the semantic verbal fluency tasks included in the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency to the semantic part of the subtraction analysis. Thus, data set A (\u201cphonemic\u201d) of the subtraction analysis included 15 studies, data set B (\u201csemantic\u201d) 13 studies. In our previous analysis, the subtraction analysis revealed a greater activation during phonemic than semantic verbal fluency tasks in a cluster in the left LIFG. Due to the inclusion of two additional semantic verbal fluency studies in the analyses of the revised manuscript, the subtraction analysis did not longer reveal different activation patterns in phonemic compared to semantic verbal fluency tasks. The observed difference of activation in the previous analysis may be the result of power differences between the two tasks, because the number of the included studies and foci in the phonemic verbal fluency task was significantly higher than in the semantic verbal fluency task. The fact that the clusters of activation in the left hemisphere coincided in phonemic (Table\u00a0 ) and semantic (Table\u00a0 ) verbal fluency tasks except for BA 24 (ACC) and 7 (Putamen) substantiate this assumption. \n\nPreviously, a domain specific activation in the left posterior temporal cortex near the middle temporal gyrus for semantic processing was found [ , , , ]. In the current meta-analysis, activation of the left temporal gyrus in the processing of semantic verbal fluency tasks as previously reported [ - , ] could not be replicated. This may be due to the lower overall activation in semantic verbal fluency tasks and the lower number of semantic verbal fluency studies included in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe studies included in our meta-analysis differed regarding design, methodology, and the study population. As shown in Tables\u00a0  and  , the included studies differ in their stimulus material, baseline condition and language (English, German, Dutch or Japanese) as well as in the kind of stimulus presentation (auditory versus visually) and response generation (overt versus covert). These differences might have affected the results of our analysis. \n\nThe included experiments used two different types of baseline conditions. Twenty-two of the 28 experiments (15 of 21 phonemic and 2 of 13 semantic fluency experiments) involved a covert or overt repetition of a given word (\u201crest\u201d) or of a familiar sequence (e.g., forward counting, days of the week or month of the year). The performance of such standardized language production requires at least some low-level phonologic processing. When subtracted from the experimental tasks, they would at its best attenuate phonologic activity in the final images, which is most likely localized to the more posterior and dorsal areas of the LIFG [ , ]. Consequently, most phonemic experiments may have underestimated the extent of phonologic activity. The second type of baseline condition was a passive task, such as silent rest or visual fixation of a cross or symbol. There is some evidence that a functionally connected brain network including the LIFG might be associated with resting states [ - ]. In this framework, the effects would be opposite to those using a standardized language production baseline task. Semantic activity would then be underestimated in semantic experiments, which used a resting state (two of thirteen semantic experiments) baseline condition. \n\nThe performance in verbal fluency tasks depends on the difficulty of the stimulus material. As can be seen in Table\u00a0 , the majority of English and German phonemic verbal fluency studies used variations of the COWAT stimulus material (FAS) additional to further letters. The use of different stimulus material could have affected our results because previous studies suggested that the CFL subtest of the COWAT is more difficult than the FAS subtest [ ]. Lacy and colleagues [ ] on the other hand revealed a comparable performance in the two forms of the COWAT. Borowski and colleagues [ ] investigated the association between different letters and their difficulty. Based on the frequency of the generated words, the authors categorized H, D, M, W, A, B, F, P, T, C, S as easy English letters, I, O, N, E, G, L, R as moderately difficult letters and Q, J, V, Y, K, and U as hard letters. According to this classification, the included studies of our meta-analysis only used easy to moderate letters. The most frequently used categories were furniture (6 of 13), animals (5 of 13) as well as fruits, food, body parts (4 of 13) and vegetables, cloths and colors (3 of 13). \n\nThe majority of the participants in the current meta-analysis were native English or German speakers, one study consisted of Dutch participants, one of Japanese individuals. The fact that different languages use different strategies for encoding grammatically information leads to the question whether an unitary network of brain regions specialized for processing grammar in a broad sense is involved in the processing of different human languages, or whether different languages impose distinct processing demands relying on non-identical neural mechanisms. Previous studies on language dependent processing of verbal material suggest that different brain networks are involved in the processing of different languages [ , ]. The language of the included studies might accordingly have affected the activation patterns. However, a secondary analysis excluding the Dutch and Japanese studies revealed the same results than the first analysis. Furthermore, Oberg and Ramirez [ ] suggested that as long as the letter frequency was considered, the number of generated words were remarkably similar across different languages. \n\nSubjects generated covert responses in 7 of 21 phonemic studies and 6 of 13 semantic, verbal fluency tasks. Whereas overt paradigms hold a risk to produce movement artifacts, covert verbal responses do not allow to determine whether the subjects perform the task as instructed and to assess the task performance [ ]. Because of the differences between covert and overt verbal fluency paradigms, it seems to be difficult to generalize the results from covert response paradigms to overt response paradigms. Furthermore, it is possible that the cognitive processes operating during covert verbal responding are different in some aspects to those operating during overt verbal responding. Although a direct comparison of overt and covert responses in a stem completion task showed greater LIFG activation with overt than covert responses, the location of the peak of activation did not differ [ ]. In order to clarify the effect of the response generation on the brain activation, we statistically compared the two sets of foci by subtracting the ALE maps of the overt and covert verbal fluency tasks. The covert fluency data set included 14 experiments reporting 122 foci, the overt data set 17 experiments reporting 255 foci and the pooled data set 31 experiments yielding 377 foci. The subtraction of the covert versus overt verbal fluency maps resulted in a higher activation likelihood in the LIFG (BA 46; X: -52; Y: 27; Z: 17; 1816\u00a0mm ). No significant differences were seen subtracting the overt from covert verbal fluency map. The auditory presented fluency data set included 18 experiments reporting 184 foci, the visually presented data set 13 experiments reporting 178 foci and the pooled data set 31 experiments yielding 362 foci. Auditory presentation of the stimuli resulted in a significantly greater activation in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 8; 312\u00a0mm ) and left Insula (BA 13, 160\u00a0mm ). \n\nRegarding gender differences in the performance of verbal fluency tasks, previous studies revealed heterogeneous results. Among the functional imaging verbal fluency studies focusing on sex differences, no study has highlighted a statistically significant behavioral difference between groups of men and women. No activation difference was found for men and women selected either on the basis of a same high level of VF performance or on differential cognitive performances (5; 60). Furthermore, a variety of non-imaging studies investigating the verbal fluency performance of healthy subjects also did not found differences between men and women in their phonemic or semantic verbal fluency performance [ - ]. On the other hand, Gauthier and colleagues [ ] reported sex effects in a sample of high performers in seven cortical structures (the left ITG, anterior and posterior cingulate, right ACC, SFG, dlPFC and lingual gyrus) during the processing of a phonemic verbal fluency paradigm. The majority of the included studies in our meta-analysis investigated the brain activation during verbal fluency tasks in a sample of men and women without consideration of gender (Tables\u00a0  and  ). Thus, we were not able to identify the activation patterns separately for men and women. \n\nIn conclusion, the aim of our meta-analysis was to compare the brain activation during the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency. Tables\u00a0  and   show that the number of studies using German or English language, a visually or auditory presentation of the stimulus material or an overt or covert paradigm was comparable between the studies investigating phonemic or semantic verbal fluency. Thus, we would suggest that the effect of these confounding variables on brain activity was equally distributed in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Nevertheless, future studies are needed which investigate the brain activation during verbal fluency tasks separately for studies using different designs with respect to stimulus presentation, language or response generation, respectively. The number of included studies in our meta-analysis, specifically in the analysis of semantic verbal fluency tasks, was too small to compare subgroups of studies presenting the stimulus material visually or auditory or using overt or covert paradigms. \n\nCoordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses usually pool studies that have different statistic thresholds. As can be seen in Tables\u00a0  and  , the statistical threshold of the individual studies of our meta-analysis ranges from strict family-wise error rate correction to uncorrected p-values of p\u2009<\u20090.005. Assuming equality across studies irrespective of their statistical threshold could have the consequence of giving more weight to studies using less strict statistical thresholds, as these are likely to report more significant findings than studies using stricter statistical thresholds [ ]. In our meta-analysis, six studies used an uncorrected statistical threshold. Additional file  : Table S1 and S2 show the number of foci from each experiment contributing to the significant clusters of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. With 9 and 5 foci, respectively, the study of Abrahams and colleagues [ ] contributed by far the most foci to cluster 1 and 2 of phonemic verbal fluency. However, in the other five studies with uncorrected statistical thresholds, it could not be observed that they report more significant findings than the studies using stricter statistical thresholds. \n\nA further limitation of our meta-analysis might be that the power of the analyses cannot be aggregated across the included studies, because the GingerALE software is not suited to correct for false negative results [ ]. On the other hand, this also means that ALE minimizes the risk of false positive results and is not susceptible for outlier effects. Meta-analytic results are often influenced by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Therefore, it is an aim of meta-analysis to statistically control for potential sources of heterogeneity. The ALE software did not allow the investigation of heterogeneity between the individual studies; therefore, we cannot fully exclude that the results might be influenced by a possible heterogeneity of the individual studies. Nevertheless, we tried to minimize the heterogeneity through the definition of relatively strict inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the new ALE algorithm is based on a random effects model, which is more conservative than the fixed-effects model and incorporates both within-study and between study variance. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current meta-analysis investigated the brain activation of healthy volunteers during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Our analyses corroborate the involvement of the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus (BA 6, 9, 45, 46, 48) as well as the ACC in the processing of verbal fluency tasks. Our comparison of brain activation during the execution of either phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks revealed evidence for spatially different activation patterns in the posterior but not the anterior regions of the LIFG/LMFG during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing. \n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nAT has received research funding from Rules based medicine Inc., Austin, Texas, USA.

Emerging evidence indicates an overlap in the neural substrates of anhedonia between MDD and SZ, which supported a transdiagnostic approach. Therefore, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in MDD and SZ to examine the neural bases of three subdomains of anhedonia: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia and emotional processing. ALE analysis focused specifically on MDD or SZ was used later to dissociate specific anhedonia-related neurobiological impairments from potential disease general impairments. ALE results revealed that consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral basal ganglia areas, while anticipatory anhedonia was associated with more substrates in frontal-striatal networks except the ventral striatum, which included the dorsal anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus. MDD and SZ patients showed similar neurobiological impairments in anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, but differences in the emotional experience task, which may also involve affective/mood general processing. These results support that anhedonia is characterized by alterations in reward processing and relies on frontal-striatal brain circuitry. The transdiagnostic approach is a promising way to reveal the overall neurobiological framework that contributes to anhedonia and could help to improve targeted treatment strategies. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11682-015-9457-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnhedonia is defined as \u2018markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day\u2019 (Association and Association  ). Although anhedonia has long been considered a prominent symptom in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SZ) (Association and Association  ), its underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recently, evidence has emerged to indicate overlap of behavioral, cognitive processing and neurobiological abnormalities between MDD and SZ patients with marked clinical anhedonia (Gradin et al.  ; Whitton et al.  ). As a result of this finding and the advocacy of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project (Insel et al.  ), investigators are seeking to use the basic behavioral dimension of functioning, rather than traditional diagnostic categories, to identify transdiagnostic neural markers of anhedonia (Corral-Frias et al.  ; Cuthbert and Insel  ; Markou et al.  ). A quantitative meta-analysis of pooled neuroimaging studies of anhedonia in MDD and SZ, discussed within the RDoC framework, is a promising approach to investigate the neural substrates of anhedonia. However, it is important to be mindful of the complexity and multi-faceted nature of clinical anhedonia to understand neuroimaging studies in this field. \n\nBased on the latest studies, anhedonia is a multidimensional construct and should not simply be considered as \u2018loss of an ability to experience pleasure\u2019. Deficits in other reward processes, such as valuation, motivation and decision-making, may lead to behaviors that can be interpreted as anhedonia (Der-Avakian and Markou  ; Gold et al.  ; Leventhal et al.  ). Hence, distinguishing the deficits in different cognitive subcomponents of anhedonia is essential to identify its neurobiological substrates. Some investigators have suggested dichotomizing anhedonia into \u2018consummatory anhedonia\u2019 (the hedonic response to rewards) and \u2018anticipatory anhedonia\u2019 (diminished motivation to pursue rewards) (Treadway and Zald  ). Others hold that studies should move away from conceptualization of anhedonia as a steady-state, mood-like phenomena, and instead focus on the reward-related motivational/decisional-making aspect (Treadway et al.  ; Whitton et al.  ). Still others propose to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical studies by isolating the neural substrates of various processes, such as sensing a pleasant stimulus or anticipating expected rewards, computing value and associated costs, determining effort required, deciding to obtain the reward, increasing motivation and performing the action (Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Changing research strategies and models demand more complicated and elaborate experimental designs to investigate the underlying neural bases of anhedonia. \n\nSeveral experimental paradigms have been developed in last decade to explore the specific processes of anhedonia beyond hedonic capacity, such as anticipation, motivation and reinforcement learning. However, only a few task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have separated anhedonia deficits into different processing stages. Early neuroimaging studies frequently adopted the passive picture-viewing task based on the viewpoint that anhedonia represents a diminished responsiveness to positive-valence stimuli (Hooker et al.  ; Mitterschiffthaler et al.  ; Shi et al.  ). More recently, some experimental reward paradigms, especially the monetary incentive delay task (MID) (Admon et al.  ; Balodis and Potenza  ; Elman et al.  ), have been increasingly used to detect neural substrates of anhedonia. Those studies have typically explored brain activity impairments in experience/consummatory and motivational/anticipatory stages separately, and they discussed the link between anhedonia and the reward-processing components of \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019 from the preclinical literature (Berridge and Robinson  ; Dillon et al.  ). Specifically, the consummatory stage was primarily associated with dysfunctions of reward coding and evaluation, and the anticipatory stage was associated with advanced cognitive functions, such as motivation and decision-making. Recently, although other paradigms have been developed to assess a specific aspect of anhedonia-related processing, such as the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which focuses on motivation and effort-based decision-making (Fervaha et al.  ; Treadway et al.  ; Yang et al.  ) and the Probabilistic Learning Task (PRT), which focuses on reward learning (Pizzagalli et al.  ), no neuroimaging studies have used these two paradigms in MDD or SZ patients. In fact, to date the majority of studies have explored the neurobiology of the three subdomains of anhedonia, which involve different neurocognitive process and functional neuroanatomy bases: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia and emotional (positive stimuli) processing (Berridge and Robinson  ; Dillon et al.  ; Smoski et al.  ). \n\nNeuroimaging studies of the three subdomains of anhedonia in MDD and SZ patients have reached inconsistent and even contradictory findings. For instance, several studies that used a reward-related task, most often MID, indicated ventral striatal blunting in depressed adults (Knutson et al.  ; Kumar et al.  ; Ubl et al.  ) and even in never-depressed youth with family history of MDD (Gotlib et al.  ). Another study using the same experimental paradigm (MID) showed no significant group difference in ventral striatum between unmedicated MDD and controls after correction (Pizzagalli et al.  ). Furthermore, Pizzagalli et al. ( ) reported decreased activation in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) during the MID task in MDD patients compared with healthy controls, whereas other studies found increased activation of dACC in MDD (Gorka et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ). Similar contradictory results have been observed in SZ patients, especially in the experience/consummatory stage. When presented with reward stimuli, SZ patients showed impairments in both ventral striatal and prefrontal areas (da Silva Alves et al.  ; Walter et al.  ), impairments in prefrontal cortex but not basal ganglia areas (Waltz et al.  ) or no impairments in either area (Mucci et al.  ; Simon et al.  ). These inconsistencies among studies may reflect differences in sample size, sample characteristics (average age, sexual ratio, medicated or not), paradigms used, and fMRI analysis methods. \n\nThe development of meta-analyses methods for neuroimaging data provide a valuable tool for combining data across diverse studies and building consensus in identification of neuroanatomical correlates of specific behavior. To date, the main methods used for the meta-analyses of neuroimaging data could be divided into two categories: the regions of interest (ROI) based meta-analytic methods, and the voxel-based meta-analytic methods. The ROI-based methods allow for optimal statistical analyses but are based on a priori hypotheses therefore being affected by a limited and potentially biased inclusion of brain regions (Rotge et al.  ; Radua and Mataix-Cols  ). On the other hand, voxel-based methods have a more exhaustive and unbiased inclusion of studies but have some statistically limitation. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), proposed by Turkeltaub and Laird (Turkeltaub et al.  ; Laird et al.  ), is probably the most common algorithm for voxel-based meta-analyses. \n\nBesides the clear mathematical logic and operation steps, ALE method has several advantages over ROI-based meta-analyses through inputting the foci of activation instead of labels, weighting the foci by the number of participants in each study, yielding a quantitative estimate of the probability of activation, identifying common activations across different studies (Laird et al.  ; Wager et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ). More importantly, the recent change from fixed-effects to random-effects inference in analyses (Eickhoff et al.  ) and the revision for multiple comparison correction (Eickhoff et al.  ) made ALE to become a more reliable statistic meta-analysis approach. \n\nTherefore, the ALE meta-analysis method was used in this review to make an objective, systematic, and quantitative analysis of the previous literature and synthesize the anhedonia-related, task-based fMRI findings in MDD and SZ from three subdomains of anhedonia: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia, and emotional processing. Specifically, we first performed the within-group ALE meta-analyses to provide a context for interpreting the anhedonia-related between-group differences. In the between-group analysis, the transdiagnostic ALE analysis of the literature on MDD and SZ was examined to provide an integrated framework of the neural bases of anhedonia, and the analysis focused specifically on MDD or SZ was used later to dissociate specific anhedonia-related neurobiological impairments from potential disease general impairments. The transdiagnostic approach provides the opportunity to identify an overall neurobiological framework for a specific symptom or behavior across multiple disease states and has the potential to improve targeted treatment strategies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nStudies focused on the neurobiology of anhedonia in patients with MDD or SZ were identified through computerized literature searches using PubMed and Web of Science. We reviewed all papers published in the English language up to August 1, 2015. The key words used for the search were \u2018anhedonia\u2019, \u2018hedonic\u2019, \u2018emotional withdrawal\u2019, \u2018pleasure deficit\u2019, \u2018apathetical social withdrawal\u2019, \u2018functional magnetic resonance\u2019 and \u2018fMRI\u2019. A total of 571 English publications were initially identified using this process. Another three articles were obtained from reference lists of prior reviews (Whitton et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). In summary, these search procedures yielded an initial pool of 574 potential articles for inclusion. \n\nIn prior neuroimaging studies focused on anhedonia, the most common paradigms adopted were the MID, reinforcement learning task (RLT) and emotional experience task (EET). For MID, RLT or some modified reward tasks, subjects initially see a cue indicating that they will have an opportunity to obtain a certain amount of reward (e.g., money), then they perform a task, and they receive immediate feedback (by obtaining or not obtaining the reward). The process between the cue and the task refers to anticipation stage, and the in-the-moment experience during receipt of a reward refers to consummatory stage. Besides, the emotional experience task (EET) is associated with a passive viewing of positive-valence stimuli that requires no response. Therefore, based on different cognitive process, we divided anhedonia into three subdomains: anticipatory anhedonia, consummatory anhedonia, and emotional processing. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \nFor the current meta-analysis, once duplicate articles were removed, the following eight inclusion criteria were utilized: (1) first-hand empirical studies; (2) subjects were healthy controls or patients with either MDD or SZ; (3) MDD or SZ were diagnosed according to DSM-IV(\u2212TR) or ICD-10; (4) studies focused on anhedonia though task-related paradigms; (5) studies examined neuronal activity related to anhedonia using fMRI; (6) studies identified foci of task-related neural changes in active conditions (e.g., emotional picture or monetary gain) and/or contrasted an active and a control condition (neutral picture or fixation cross); (7) coordinates were reported in either standard Talairach space or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. Figure   shows the process of study identification and selection. From the identification and selection of studies, coordinate results of within-group activations and between-group differences were divided into 4 groups: activations in patients, activations in healthy controls, increases in patients relative to controls, and increases in controls relative to patients.   \nFlowchart describing the process of study identification and selection \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) procedure \n  \nMeta-analysis was performed using the ALE software implemented in GingerALE version 2.3.2 ( ). This ALE version used a random effect model and weighted for sample size of the original studies (Laird et al.  ). In ALE, activation foci reported in original studies are treated as 3D Gaussian distributions centered at the reported coordinates. Activation probabilities are then calculated for each standard-space voxel to construct ALE maps for contrasts of interest. To determine the reliability of the ALE map, null-distributions are generated by analyzing the distribution of ALE values across independent studies, which is conceptually similar to using permutation tests of individual voxels across experiments. The observed values in the ALE distribution are then compared to the null distribution in order to assign probability estimates to the observed (experimental) data. \n\nFor the present meta-analysis, single studies were used respectively to perform meta-analyses of anhedonia for each of the three subdomains. Coordinates of the foci of activation reported in MNI were transformed to Talairach space using the icbm2tal in GingerALE. The threshold of statistical significance was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 and corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) with a minimum cluster size of 400\u00a0mm . For visualization, whole-brain maps of thresholded ALE maps were imported into multi-image analysis GUI (MANGO;  ) and overlaid onto a standardized anatomical template in Talairach space ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Article inclusion \n  \nFigure   shows the study selection flowchart, and Table   shows the pooled data for all contrasts. A total of 32 articles with 684 healthy controls reporting 353 foci, and 28 articles with 562 patients reporting 214 foci were included in within-group analysis. A total of 57 articles (33 articles on MDD and 24 on SZ) with 986 patients and 1041 healthy controls and reporting 453 foci were included in the transdiagnostic meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in age or sex between patients (34.33\u2009\u00b1\u20098.55\u00a0years old; 51.09\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (32.12\u2009\u00b1\u20097.09\u00a0years old; 51.71\u00a0% men), MDD patients (36.40\u2009\u00b1\u20098.79\u00a0years old; 40.82\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (33.85\u2009\u00b1\u20098.42\u00a0years old; 39.80\u00a0% men) or between SZ patients (30.75\u2009\u00b1\u20096.96\u00a0years old; 63.64\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (31.85\u2009\u00b1\u20093.70\u00a0years old; 71.33\u00a0% men).   \nPublished fMRI studies included in the between-group ALE analysis of anhedonia across MDD and SZ \n  \n MID   = Monetary Incentive Delay Task;   EET   = Emotional Experience/regulation Task;   RLT   = Reward Learning Task;   WOF   = Wheel of Fortune task;   MNI   = Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates;   TAL   = Talairach and Tournoux coordinates \n  \n\n\n### Within-group ALE analysis \n  \n#### Healthy controls \n  \nFor reward consummatory (16 studies and 160 foci), ALE revealed a set of subcortical areas, including bilateral globus pallidus (GPe), bilateral red nucleus, right caudate body, left substania nigra (SN) and right putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus, as well as left medial frontal gyrus (mPFC). For reward anticipation (17 studies and 99 foci), ALE results showed robust activation of a broad cortical-subcortical network, including left GPe, right caudate head, left caudate body, bilateral red nucleus, right inferior frontal cortex (IFG), right superior temporal\u00a0gyrus (STG), right insula, left mPFC and some midbrain areas, such as mammillary body. For the emotional processing (9 studies and 94 foci), several regions in frontal gyrus were activated to a greater degree, such as mPFC, MFG and IFG, as well as the middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm3, Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nWithin-group ALE meta-analysis results in healthy controls and patients (mixed MDD and SZ) \n  \n p\u2009<  \u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size >400\u00a0mm ;   BA =   Brodmann area \n    \nSignificant ALE maps (FDR corrected,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >400\u00a0mm3) of within-group analysis in healthy control group (HC) and transdiagnostic patient group (mixed MDD and SZ) for reward consummatory, reward anticipation, and emotional processing \n  \n\n\n#### Patients (mixed MDD and SZ) \n  \nFor reward consummatory (11 studies and 68 foci), ALE analysis found seven statistically significant activation clusters, including left GPe, right caudate head, left red nucleus, right insula, left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), IFG and amydala. Reward anticipation (14 studies and 63 foci) was related to the significant activation of putamen, superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and IFG. As to the emotional processing (7 studies and 83 foci), increased likelihood of activation was observed in several frontal gyrus, temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, as well as caudate body (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm3, Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ). The results of within-group analysis results in MDD or SZ separately showed the similarly distribution and activation pattern (details see Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Between-group ALE analysis in a transdiagnostic approach across MDD and SZ \n  \n#### Consummatory anhedonia \n  \nFor consummatory anhedonia (29 studies and 151 foci), ALE analysis revealed five statistically significant clusters with decreased likelihood of activation in patients compared to controls (Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ), including bilateral caudate head and body, bilateral GPe, left putamen, right red nucleus, left ventral lateral nucleus and pulvinar, as well as MTG (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01,, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm ).

Increased likelihood of activation was observed in the left IFG and MFG. \n\n\n#### Emotional processing \n  \nFor the emotional experience task (31 studies and 163 foci), decreased likelihood of activation was observed in a number of brain areas from the cortical-subcortical network (Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ), including right GPe, right putamen, right medial dorsal nucleus and ventrolateral nucleus of thalamus, bilateral amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus, right IFG, left mPFC, left ACC and STG/MTG (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm ). Increased likelihood of activation was observed in the left middle occipital gyrus and fusiform gyrus. \n\n\n\n### Between-group ALE analysis in MDD or SZ \n  \n#### MDD \n  \nFor consummatory anhedonia in MDD (21 studies and 107 foci), decreased likelihood of activation was observed in the left GPe, right caudate body, left putamen, right insula and left ACC (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm3; Table S2 and Fig.\u00a0 ).

Results revealed that consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral basal ganglia areas, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and various subcortical areas. Anticipatory anhedonia was related to dysfunctions within basal ganglia regions like caudate and putamen, as well as various subregions of prefrontal cortex, such as anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Emotional processing of positive-valence stimuli was related to more distributed dysfunction, involving more of basal ganglia (putamen and GPe), thalamus, limbic regions (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus), prefrontal cortex (IFG, mPFC, ACC), STG and middle occipital gyrus. Meta-analyses of MDD and SZ respectively revealed similar impairments in brain regions and activation patterns in consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia in these two diseases, but differences in emotional processing. \n\n### The neural correlates of different reward processing component \n  \nThe within-group analysis results of healthy controls showed that the three reward processing components related with anhedonia were differentially recruited the subregions in the basal ganglia and forebrain. Specifically, the reward consummatory processing was mainly concentrated on a series of subcortical regions including GPe, ventral striatum, SN, as well as mPFC and extended orbitofrontal cortex, which is consistent with a number of animal and human studies (Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Recent researches suggests that the opioid and GABA-ergic systems may play important role in that hedonic responses (at least to primary sensory stimuli). On the other side, reward anticipatory processing was more involved in dorsal striatum and cortical areas except for the ventral striatum and medial profrontal areas,, such as inferior frontal gyrus and insula. Those results highlighted importance of frontostriatal circuitry in reward anticipatory/prediction processing (Barch and Dowd  ; Jarbo and Verstynen  ) and indicated that further investigation are needed on identifying the connectivites between subareas of frontal cortex and striatum for specific reward component. Unlike the neural correlates of reward consummatory and anticipation, the within-group analyses for emotional processing task revealed much more widely distributed cortical areas in healthy controls, but not many subcortical regions. Those results suggested that the activated brain areas in emotional experience task may be the synthesis of various cognitive and emotional response related with reward. Furthermore, both the transdiagnostic analysis with mixed patients group and the analysis with MDD or SZ group separately showed a similarly contributed but less activated pattern with that of healthy controls in each of the subdomains of anhedonia. \n\n\n### Transdiagnostic neural markers of anhedonia \n  \nIn both MDD and SZ, anhedonia is considered to be a core clinical characteristic (Griffiths et al.  ; Treadway et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). Animal studies have demonstrated parallel substrates across different disorders associated with altered anhedonia-related processing (Barr and Phillips  ; Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Therefore, researchers suggested that common pathological mechanisms could underlie anhedonia-related processing, supporting a transdiagnostic approach to reveal these underlying cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms. In this review, we applied an ALE meta-analysis to MDD and SZ to provide an integrated framework of the neural bases of anhedonia. \n\nBased on the results of this transdiagnostic meta-analysis, consummatory anhedonia is related to decreased activation in several subcortical regions, such as caudate head and body, putamen, red nucleus, GPe, and pulvinar. Animal studies have demonstrated involvement of the ventral striatum and ventral pallidum in the experience of pleasure and hedonic perception of rewards (Berridge and Kringelbach  ; Kelley et al.  ). Furthermore, patients with ventral pallidus damage have significantly reduced responses to rewards or pleasant stimuli (Miller et al.  ; Vijayaraghavan et al.  ). Consistent with previous findings, our meta-analysis further implicated the opioid and GABA-ergic systems in the nucleus accumbens shell and its projections to the ventral pallidum, in deficits of in-the-moment hedonic experience. Specifically, reduced caudate activation has been reported to be associated with blunted processing of incentive perception and reinforcement learning in both MDD and SZ (Dowd and Barch  ; Pizzagalli  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ). A more recent conceptualization of pulvinar function posited that this region plays an important role in emotional salience and awareness (Hamilton et al.  ; Pessoa and Adolphs  ) and has strong bidirectional connectivity with insula and dACC (Mufson and Mesulam  ). Given this role of the pulvinar, we propose that low-level pulvinar activation may blunt hedonic experience through insufficient attention and awareness of reward-related information. To summarize, ALE meta-analysis on consummatory anhedonia processing emphasized the critical role of ventral basal ganglia and medial prefrontal pathways in generating the in-the-moment hedonic value representation and experience. \n\nFor anticipatory anhedonia, ALE showed involvement of the caudate and putamen, as well as several prefrontal subregions, such as dACC (BA32), mPFC and MFG. Previous studies suggested that multiple prefrontal-striatal pathways and reciprocal connections within subregions of PFC play an important role in regulating behavioral response to rewards or pleasurable stimuli in the motivational/anticipatory stage (Der-Avakian and Markou  ; Salamone and Correa  ). For instance, disruption of glutamatergic signaling between the mPFC and nucleus accumbens resulted in avolition for rewards (Faure et al.  ). Moreover, striatal lesions or dopamine depletion in striatum or dACC impaired the computation of effort-related costs, which then lead to a deficit of effort-based decision-making as the expected rewards were discounted (Croxson et al.  ). Preclinical studies further stressed that dACC plays an important role in signaling the net value (benefits minus costs) during social interactions (Apps and Ramnani  ). In brief, during the anticipation stage for reward or pleasurable stimuli, abnormal activation in mPFC, dACC and MFG may lead to failure to anticipate forthcoming rewards, including updating/maintaining the value of pleasant stimuli, effort-value computation, decision-making to engage in goal-directed activity and monitoring incentive-based behavioral responses (Haber and Knutson  ; Pujara and Koenigs  ; Wallis and Kennerley  ). The results of our meta-analysis consistently indicated that a number of brain regions and pathways, involving many neurotransmitter systems, mediated different aspects of anhedonia-related deficits. Consequently, this preliminary neural framework supports the conceptualization of anhedonia as a symptom with multiple components. Rigorous experimental paradigms and careful designs should be carried out in future work to provide a more refined description of anhedonia and to separate the neural bases of each aspect of anhedonia-related processing. \n\nOur ALE analysis for anticipatory anhedonia also revealed reduced activation of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, which could impair retrieval of previous autobiographical memories and their incorporation into working memory to represent the value of a reward and anticipate a pleasurable stimulus (Adcock et al.  ; Zhu et al.  ; Mazgaj et al.  ). However, we did not observe any significant group difference between patients and controls in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is considered to be a key cortical region involved in anhedonia, in particular in the reward value presentation (Kringelbach  ; Pizzagalli  ). One possible explanation is that detection of OFC is challenging for functional MRI experiments using regular EPI sequences due to strong magnetic susceptibility variation near the air-filled sinuses and corresponding signal loss and distortion (Faro et al.  ; Osterbauer et al.  ). Future investigation of this unique structure will benefit from advances in imaging sequences or MRI hardware. \n\nGiven the complex neural pathways in the frontal-striatal-thalamic circuitry, it is necessary to further divide each subcortical structure (e.g., striatum) into subregions to investigate the function of different cortical-subcortical connections. For instance, the striatum can be divided into three functional subregions (i.e., limbic, associative and sensorimotor) based on afferent inputs from the frontal cortex (Haber  ; Haber et al.  ; Iversen  ; van den Bos et al.  ). Consummatory anhedonia is mainly associated with limbic/ventral striatum, including anterior and ventral caudate and putamen (Corral-Frias et al.  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ), whereas anticipatory anhedonia is associated with both limbic/ventral striatum and associative striatum, including the dorsal caudate and anterior part of the dorsal putamen (Delgado  ; Dichter et al.  ; Mucci et al.  ). The results of our meta-analysis provide new evidence that dysfunction in distinct frontal-striatal pathways contributes to the different components of anhedonia-related processing. Based on this preliminary neural framework, further studies are needed to identify the functional and structural connections underlying these components of anhedonia-related processing. \n\nALE analysis of the emotional experience task revealed more widely distributed differences between patients and controls. In addition to blunted activation in basal ganglia and thalamus, a number of regions in limbic areas, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cerebellum also showed decreased activation in patients, whereas the visual association cortices showed increased activation. Given that the emotional experience task required no response and may include various cognitive and affective components, it is unclear whether those different activations reflect only the neural bases of anhedonia. Recent resting-state fMRI showed that different neural circuits were engaged in the emotional task-general and emotion task-specific processing (Cole et al.  ), which would be differently activated by the emotional experience task between controls and patients with affective symptoms. Moreover, functional connectivity analysis demonstrated distinct circuits associated with severity of general affective symptoms (i.e., depression) and anhedonia (Gabbay et al.  ). Indeed, a set of brain regions, including the anterior and posterior cingulate, mPFC, basal ganglia and visual areas, were activated during passive viewing of positive-valence stimuli, but the ventral striatum and mPFC were the key regions correlated with self-reported anhedonia severity (Epstein et al.  ; Harvey et al.  ). Therefore, more elaborate experimental designs will be required to explore the underlying neural bases of general mood-related processing and specific emotional experiences (e.g., hedonia). \n\n\n### Disease-specific findings: MDD and SZ \n  \nTo further explore anhedonia-related neural mechanisms and identify potential disease-specific or task-specific confounders, ALE analysis was compared between MDD and SZ patients across the three anhedonia subdomains. In general, anhedonia-related impairment was consistent between MDD and SZ patients across the consummatory and anticipatory stages. Those findings suggest that the neural substrates involved in accurate appraisal of positive stimuli and generation of reward responses, but not the substrates underlying hedonic emotion arousal, are likely to be the core brain areas associated with anhedonia. Furthermore, these data provide a partial explanation for the discordance between self-reported trait pleasure and momentary pleasure in previous behavioral studies: MDD and SZ patients reported normative affective ratings in response to evocative laboratory stimuli, but low positive affect and pleasurable experiences on evaluation of inventories (Osuch et al.  ; Pizzagalli  ; Strauss  ; Treadway and Zald  ). From a cognitive processing pespective, laboratory-based assessment of consummatory anhedonia may reflect the capacity for hedonic experience, while the patient self-reports in clinical interviews and inventories might reflect both the hedonic experience deficit and the inability to accurately represent incentive experiences. Based on this interpretation, the theoretical definition of anhedonia for research and targeted treatment may need to be modified. \n\nIn contrast to the consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia domains, which were similar across MDD and SZ, emotional experience tasks showed striking differences. In MDD patients, decreased activation was much more widely distributed across brain regions, including basal ganglia, amygdala, frontal gyrus and cerebellum; SZ patients only showed decreased activation in thalamus. As previously noted, the emotional experience task requires no response and may reflect other cognitive and affective components. Our results support that the emotional experience task induced both affective/mood-related and anhedonia-specific responses. It is worth noting that only blunted activation in part of ventral basal ganglia was correlated with anhedonia in MDD patients viewing positive valence pictures (Epstein et al.  ; Mitterschiffthaler et al.  ; Osuch et al.  ), which was highly consistent with the correlations between dysfunctional BOLD signals and anhedonia in a consummatory anhedonia task (Gradin et al.  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ). Overall, it appears that an emotional experience task, such as passively viewing pictures or words, may not be a pure measure of anhedonia (i.e., consummatory anhedonia) and may capture the affective responses related with general mood, which may influence results in populations with prominent depressive symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nPotential limitations of this study should be noted. First of all, ALE technique does have its own limitations. Unlike the meta-analyses in which the complete activation maps are included, the data used in ALE were based solely on reported peak activation coordinates. Thereby ALE could not take into account those studies without any significant clusters reported, which may resulting in a systematic overestimation bias of the results. Besides, the present ALE software cannot conduct the correlation analysis or deal with covariates, thus the only way to consider the covariates was run follow-up analyses, e.g., only on experiments investigating only female subjects or unmedicated patients when considering the gender or medication effect. An additional limitation of the ALE is that it may be unable to assess subtle methodological differences in individual studies such as the thresholding used in the original studies, relative strength of activations/differences between groups and differences in preprocessing steps (Radua and Mataix-Cols  ). Nevertheless, previous studies suggested that no individual study could significantly bias the results of ALE meta-analyses after including the sample size and number of reported foci into ALE algorithm, changing from fixed-effects to random-effects inference, and revising for multiple comparison correction (Eickhoff et al.  ; Turkeltaub et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Kollndorfer et al.  ). In the present study, the robustness of results was further supported by the reasonably coherent findings in within-group ALE analysis of various reward processing components and between-group analyses of subdomains of anhedonia, which were also consistent with previous neurobioglogical studies on animals. \n\nSecondly, given that the patients in 31/35 MDD studies and 22/25 SZ studies were treated in their lifetime by antidepressant or antipsychotics, the drug effects on the brain activated pattern in reward-related processing are potential confounding factors which need to be addressed (Clarke et al.  ; Boccia et al.  ). Most antidepressant treatments act on the serotonergic or noradrenergic circuits, but not directly enhance Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, which plays a significant role in motivation and reward processing (Berridge  ; Treadway and Zald  ). However, recent literature showed that the antidepressant mechanism such as increasing serotonin (5-HT) originating from midbrain raphe nuclei (RN), could sequentially decrease the dopamine inhibition and increased ventral striatal activity to reward in humans and animals (Dremencov et al.  ; Dunlop and Nemeroff  ; Ossewaarde et al.  ; El Yacoubi et al.  ). As for the antipsychotic treatment that directly impacts the DA neurotransmission, evidence showed that the first generation (typical) and second generation (atypical) antipsychotic medications had different effects on the neural correlates of reward/motivation tasks (Juckel et al.  ,  ; Kirsch et al.  ; Schlagenhauf et al.  ). For instance, Kirsch et al. found that patients with typical antipsychotics showed reduced ventral striatal activation, while atypically treated patients showed significantly stronger activation of the right ventral striatum. Those results were further supported by a controlled, longitudinal study (Nielsen et al.  ) . The different impact of typical and atypical antipsychotics on reinforcement learning of reward processing were also supported by both behavioral evidences (Beninger et al.  ; Keri et al.  ) and neuroimaging data (Insel et al.  ). Further clinical and basic studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanism of those effects. \n\n\n### Conclusion and future directions \n  \nIn summary, our ALE meta-analysis supported characterization of anhedonia by alterations in reward processing, which contain multiple complicated components and rely on many brain regions within frontal-striatal circuitry. Specifically, consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral striatum and pallidum, while anticipatory anhedonia was more associated with more substrates in frontal-striatal networks except the ventral striatum, which included the dorsal anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus. However, the emotional experience task (passive viewing of positive pictures or words) revealed mixed findings, including dysfunction in both the anhedonia-related and affective/mood processing regions. Therefore, the transdiagnostic approach holds promise for providing both overall and specific neurobiological frameworks of anhedonia. \n\nAlthough our meta-analysis presents novel, meaningful evidence regarding the neurobiology of anhedonia, it only distinguished the neural substrates of motivation to pursue rewards and hedonic response to rewards. Future work is needed to dissect the different neurobiological pathways that are related to the various reward-processing subcomponents, such as perceiving pleasure, encoding reward value, calculating costs and benefits, learning from prior reinforcement, making decisions and execute the action to pursue a reward. It is important to note that anhedonia also plays an important role in several other psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (Loas et al.  ), post-traumatic stress disorder (Frewen et al.  ) and drug addiction (Balodis and Potenza  ; Hatzigiakoumis et al.  ), albeit in heterogeneous ways. Therefore, combining more categories of disorders and using a greater sample size in future studies should further elucidate the neural foundations of anhedonia. \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 4838562, "text_md5": "38decf3ebc7e1f7295c4e56aef792b74", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 131], "journal": [132, 151], "publication_year": [153, 157], "title": [168, 258], "keywords": [272, 391], "abstract": [404, 2189], "body": [2198, 43929]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26487590, "doi": "10.1007/s11682-015-9457-6", "pmcid": "4838562", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838562", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4838562"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838562\">4838562</a>", "list_title": "PMC4838562  Mapping anhedonia-specific dysfunction in a transdiagnostic approach: an ALE meta-analysis"}

In order to determine whether, and to what extent, cortical functional neuroanatomy supports a distinction between affective and discriminative touch, an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis was performed. This meta\u2010analysis statistically mapped reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations from 17 published affective touch studies in which tactile stimulation was associated with positive subjective evaluation (  n  \u2009=\u2009291, 34 experimental contrasts). A separate ALE meta\u2010analysis mapped regions most likely to be activated by tactile stimulation during detection and discrimination tasks (  n  \u2009=\u20091,075, 91 experimental contrasts). These meta\u2010analyses revealed dissociable regions for affective and discriminative touch, with posterior insula (PI) more likely to be activated for affective touch, and primary somatosensory cortices (SI) more likely to be activated for discriminative touch. Secondary somatosensory cortex had a high likelihood of engagement by both affective and discriminative touch. Further, meta\u2010analytic connectivity (MCAM) analyses investigated network\u2010level co\u2010activation likelihoods independent of task or stimulus, across a range of domains and paradigms. Affective\u2010related PI and discriminative\u2010related SI regions co\u2010activated with different networks, implicated in dissociable functions, but sharing somatosensory co\u2010activations. Taken together, these meta\u2010analytic findings suggest that affective and discriminative touch are dissociable both on the regional and network levels. However, their degree of shared activation likelihood in somatosensory cortices indicates that this dissociation reflects functional biases within tactile processing networks, rather than functionally and anatomically distinct pathways.

This emotional aspect of touch has been called \u201caffective touch,\u201d a category term capturing tactile processing with a hedonic or motivational component. It has been proposed as a relatively distinct category of touch, with qualitative and anatomical correlates distinguishable from the more well\u2010mapped pathways of \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d [Olausson et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ]. In this perspective, affective touch is functionally distinct from discriminative touch, in that it preferentially weights tactile stimuli in affective, motivational, or hedonic terms, such as valence or reward value. This may be especially relevant in contexts in which touch can carry affective significance, particularly social interactions [Morrison, et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ]. \n\nYet to what extent does the neuroanatomical organization of somatosensory cortices suggest a distinction between affective and discriminative touch? A parsimonious possibility is that processing in discriminative\u2010associated networks such as primary somatosensory cortex (SI) can completely account for affective phenomena in the tactile domain. That is, discriminative terms could be sufficient for coding affectively\u2010relevant variables. On this view, affective processing need not constitute an intrinsic component of the somatosensory domain\u2014after all, affective processing of pictures does not imply a special system for \u201caffective vision.\u201d A similar but less extreme possibility is that discriminative somatosensory networks, such as those involving SI, could play a direct role in hedonic evaluation [Gazzola et al.,  ]. \n\nOn the other hand, emerging evidence supports the possibility that somatosensation   does   involve an intrinsic affective dimension, over and beyond the functional and anatomical scope of classical discriminative somatosensory networks. This evidence stems mainly from the discovery of unmyelinated afferents sensitive to light touch on the skin, called tactile C (CT) afferents [Nordin et al.,  ; Vallbo et al.,  ; Wessberg et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ]. In humans, the mean firing frequency of CT afferents correlates with the mean subjective pleasantness of skin stroking [L\u00f6ken et al.,  , Ackerley et al.,  ], and their signaling is associated with activation of the posterior insular cortex [PI; Olausson et al.,  ; Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et al.,  ; Gordon et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. This evidence increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that affective and discriminative touch are indeed processed in the cortex in a dissociable manner. \n\nThis hypothesis was addressed here using an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis of 17 affective touch studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This meta\u2010analysis revealed peaks with significantly high probability of activation across studies, regardless of variations in methods, stimuli, and experimental paradigms. Its purpose was to identify likely activation hubs robustly implicated in affective touch. To discover the functional specificity of these activations, they were statistically compared to activations reported in studies involving discriminative tactile paradigms. It was predicted that areas consistently reported in affective touch studies, particularly posterior insula, would be dissociable from somatosensory regions activated by discriminative touch paradigms, such as SI. Another aim was to more closely explore any functional specificity of parietal opercular (PO) somatosensory regions, which have been reported in both discriminative and affective touch contexts. \n\nFurther, to determine whether these hubs are associated with different brain\u2010wide networks, a meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis was performed. The aim of the MCAM analysis was to assess differential degrees of functional co\u2010activation across multiple study types, between the affect\u2010related and discriminative\u2010related regions identified by the ALE meta\u2010analysis. Studies of anatomical connectivity in the insula suggest that PI has a relatively close relationship with PO somatosensory networks [Cerliani et al.,  ; Evrard et al.,  ; Kurth et al.,  , Uddin et al.,  ]. The present study hypothesized that affectively\u2010 and discriminatively\u2010biased regions, though each tactile\u2010related and anatomically interconnected, are distinguishable by differential co\u2010activations with other networks throughout the brain. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Meta\u2010Analysis Criteria \n  \n#### Affective touch map \n  \nThe affective touch meta\u2010analysis included published fMRI studies of affective touch (Table  ). Studies published 1999 through early 2015 were identified through knowledge of the field, supplemented by PubMed literature search with keyword combinations \u201caffective\u2009+\u2009touch,\u201d \u201cpleasant\u2009+\u2009touch,\u201d \u201ctouch\u2009+\u2009emotion,\u201d and \u201cfMRI.\u201d The inclusion criteria for \u201caffective touch\u201d were cutaneous tactile stimulation associated with a reported positive hedonic subjective rating (  e.g  ., pleasantness), regardless of stimulation site or stimulus type (  e.g  ., hand, soft velvet, lotion, etc). Studies involving drug manipulations or patient populations were included only if they reported contrasts   within   healthy, drug\u2010free, adult control groups. Studies involving pain and pharmacological manipulations (eg, intranasal oxytocin spray) were excluded, as well as those involving semantic, graphic, or anticipatory manipulations without reporting tactile\u2010only conditions or contrasts (  e.g  . word stimuli independent of tactile stimulation). The resulting dataset consisted of 17 papers (34 experimental contrasts) with a total   N   of 291 unique subjects (with an overall   N   of 552 across all contrasts), and 166 foci (See Table  ). Of these, two studies reported coordinates based on mask or region\u2010of\u2010interest (ROI) restriction not defined by whole\u2010brain contrasts within the same data set (marked in Table  ). \n  \nStudies, stimulus, and foci information for affective touch meta\u2010analysis \n    \n\n#### Discriminate\u2010detect map \n  \nBrainMap's Sleuth software (version 2.32) was used to identify all fMRI studies in the BrainMap database ( ) that reported activation for innocuous cutaneous tactile stimulation with task instructions to   detect   or to   discriminate   the stimulus, regardless of stimulation site or stimulus type (for example, a task to determine the orientation of a textured gradient, or the presence or absence of a tactile stimulus). The same exclusion criteria as the \u201caffective touch\u201d meta\u2010analysis were applied. The resulting dataset consisted of 25 papers, with a total   N   of 1075 subjects across 91 experimental contrasts, and 683 foci (see Supporting Information for reference list). This dataset provided a representative (rather than exhaustive) sample of studies involving discriminative touch (see Supporting Information Fig. S1). \n\n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) Analysis \n  \nALE analysis is a coordinate\u2010based, probabilistic meta\u2010analytic technique for assessing the co\u2010localization of reported activations across studies [Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ]. A first step is the categorization of experiments in the literature, for example by stimulus and/or task. Based on this, whole\u2010brain probability maps are created across the reported foci in standardized stereotaxic space (Talairach or MNI). The present meta\u2010analysis used GingerALE software to create probability maps [ ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Laird et al..,  ; Turkeltaub et al..,  ]. Here, probabilities are modeled by 3D Gaussian density distributions that take into account sample size variability by adjusting the FWHM for each study [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. For each voxel, GingerALE estimates the cumulative probabilities that at least one study reports activation for that locus. This voxelwise procedure generates a statistically thresholded ALE map, assuming and accounting for spatial uncertainty across reports. The resulting ALE values thus reflect the probability of reported activation at that locus, with high values for high probability estimates. This value is tested, using random effects, against the null hypothesis that activation is independently distributed across all studies in the meta\u2010analysis [see Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ]. \n\nCoordinates for all meta\u2010analyses were transformed to MNI space (stereotaxic coordinates of the Montreal Neurological Institute), where necessary. For both meta\u2010analyses here, the Lancaster et al. [ ] transform was applied (Laird et al.,  ); manually in the affective touch loci, and automatically via Sleuth software for the discriminative touch loci. To determine the likely spatial convergence of reported activations across studies, the resulting coordinates were submitted to an ALE analysis using GingerALE software [Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ] and thresholded with a false discovery rate (FDR, pN; Genovese et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ,  ) of q\u2009<\u20090.001 with a 200 mm cluster size threshold. FDR pN does not assume independence and thus provides a strict threshold. Owing to the relatively small sample size of affective touch literature, relatively conservative thresholds were applied. The cluster size threshold applied exceeds the minimum estimated distribution of contiguous volumes across the whole brain [Eickhoff et al.,  ], and is therefore conservative with respect to FDR. Likewise, a conservative mask size was subsequently applied to the resulting statistical maps, to ensure restriction to activations within the brain. The statistical maps were visualized on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) anatomical template using MRIcron software ( ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### ALE Maps \n  \n#### Affective touch map \n  \nThe \u201caffective touch\u201d meta\u2010analysis yielded 3 clusters with significantly high probability of activation across studies: right posterior insula (Ig2), 40, \u221214, 8 (max ALE score 0.028); two peaks in a cluster encompassing right posterior insula and adjacent parietal operculum (Ig2/OP1), 46, \u221226, 22 and 46, \u221216, 10 (max ALE score 0.039 and 0.032 respectively); and left parietal operculum (OP1), \u221254, \u221224, 20 (max ALE score 0.40). See Table   and Fig.  . \n  \nActivation likelihood estimate (ALE) maps and contrasts for affective and discriminative touch.   Upper left panel  : Clusters in posterior insula (40, \u221214, 8) and parietal operculum (46, \u221226, 22; 46, \u221216, 10) with a significantly high likelihood of activation for touch stimulation associated with positive subjective ratings (\u201caffective touch\u201d). Map reflects reported activations across 17 studies (  N  \u2009=\u2009291 unique subjects; see Table  ).   Upper right panel  : Clusters in primary (48, \u221238, 44) and secondary (52, \u221224, 20; \u221258, \u221220, 14) somatosensory cortices with a significantly high likelihood of activation for touch stimulation associated with tactile discrimination tasks (\u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d). Map reflects reported activations across 25 studies,   N  \u2009=\u20091075.   Bottom left panel  : A cluster in posterior insula (42, \u221214, 8) had a significantly higher specific activation likelihood for affective touch, as revealed by a contrast between affective and discriminative ALE maps.   Bottom right panel  : A cluster in primary somatosensory cortex (47,\u201039, 46) had a significantly higher specific activation likelihood for discriminative touch, as revealed by a contrast between discriminative and affective ALE maps (see Table   for other clusters). All maps thresholded at FDR (pN)   q  \u2009<\u20090.001, minimum cluster size 200 mm. All coordinates reported in MNI space. \n    \nClusters revealed by activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis for affective touch, discriminative touch, and contrasts \n      \nTask\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent network co\u2010activation clusters revealed by meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis for affective touch posterior insula (PI) seed region, discriminative touch primary somatosensory (SI) seed region, and contrasts \n    \n\n#### Discrimination map \n  \nThe detect\u2010discriminate (\u201cdiscrimination\u201d) touch meta\u2010analysis yielded 11 clusters with significantly high probability of activation across studies. These cluster locations are summarized in Table  ; see also Fig.  . The largest of these fell in postcentral somatosensory\u2010related regions: bilateral parietal operculum (OP4), 52, \u221224, 20 and \u221258, \u221220, 14 (max ALE scores 0.51 and 0.038 respectively); and right primary somatosensory cortex (SI), 48, \u221238, 44 (max ALE score 0.043). \n\n\n\n### Contrasts \n  \n#### Affective vs. discriminative touch \n  \nTo discover clusters with a higher likelihood of activation by affective touch compared with discriminative touch, a contrast between the affective and discriminative ALE maps was performed [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. This contrast yielded a single cluster in right posterior insula (Ig2), 42,\u201014, 8 (max ALE score 3.71). See Table   and Fig.  . \n\n\n#### Discriminative vs. affective touch \n  \nTo discover clusters with a higher likelihood of activation by discriminative touch compared with affective touch, a contrast between the affective and discriminative ALE maps was likewise performed. This contrast yielded 3 clusters: postcentral gyrus (SI), 47,\u201039, 46 (max ALE score 3.71); precentral sulcus, \u221240,\u20104, 39 (max ALE score 3.35); and supplementary motor area (SMA), 0,\u20101, 51 (max ALE score 3.71). See Table   and Fig.  . \n\n\n#### Conjunction: affective and discriminative touch \n  \nIn order to determine whether any areas made a statistically comparable contribution to both affective and discriminative likelihood maps, a conjunction (intersection) analysis was performed. Two clusters contributed to both maps, both in parietal operculum bilaterally: right OP4, 48,\u201026, 22 (max ALE score 0.032); and left OP4/1, \u221254,\u201020, 18 (max ALE score 0.031). See Table   and Fig.  . \n  \nSelectivity and bias in somatosensory activation likelihood maps for aspects of affective touch.   Right  : Nonselective secondary somatosensory clusters (48, \u221226, 22; \u221254, \u221220, 18) significantly likely to be activated in both affective and discriminative touch paradigms, as revealed by a conjunction of affective and discriminative touch ALE maps.   Left  : Relative contributions of stimulated skin type (hairy, red; or glabrous, blue) to the affective touch ALE map. Despite an overall sampling bias toward hairy skin stimulation in affective touch studies (78%), 67% of the contributing foci in a PO cluster (46, \u221226, 22) reflect glabrous skin stimulation. All other clusters in the affective touch map reflected a 100% contribution of hairy skin stimulation. Contributions to the right PO cluster (52, \u221224, 20) from the discriminative touch map (overlaid in green) were exclusively from glabrous skin stimulation. All maps thresholded at FDR (pN) q\u2009<\u20090.001, minimum cluster size 200 mm. All coordinates reported in MNI space. \n  \n\n#### Spatial mapping by skin type \n  \nOf the 32 contrasts in the affective touch meta\u2010analysis, 78% involved stimulation of hairy skin, whereas 22% involved stimulation of glabrous skin. To determine whether any region showed disproportionate specificity for glabrous skin inputs sufficient to overcome this sampling bias, the affective touch map was decomposed into separate ALE maps for stimulation on glabrous and hairy skin, applying the same thresholds as the overall map. This revealed a glabrous\u2010specific cluster in right parietal operculum (46,\u201026, 22; Fig.  ), indicating that glabrous\u2010related foci make a differential contribution to the activation likelihood of this region. The peak coordinates for this cluster coincided with the right PO peak in the overall affective touch map, which fell in a cluster contiguous with the right PI peak (see Table  ). It also overlapped with the right cluster for the conjunction between affective and discriminative maps (Table  ; Fig.  ). Peak ALE coordinates for the remaining three clusters reflected contributions from hairy skin stimulation and coincided with the right PI peak, the left PI cluster, and the left PO cluster, respectively. See Table   and Fig.  . \n\nTo confirm relative contributions of skin type (hairy, glabrous) for each of these clusters, the percentage of the foci contributions were calculated for hairy and glabrous skin stimulation on clusters resulting from the affective touch map. This was performed by tallying the foci contributions from reported contrasts involving hairy or glabrous stimulation for each cluster on the overall map. To separate the PO and PI\u2010centered peaks from the contiguous right hemisphere cluster, the map was first re\u2010thresholded at a higher threshold of pN\u2009<\u20090.0001. All previous clusters survived, with reduced extent (compare cluster sizes on Table  , \u201cAffective touch\u201d with \u201cAffective glabrous skin bias\u201d and \u201cAffective hairy skin bias\u201d). This exploration confirmed that the right PO cluster reflects a differential, disproportionate contribution from glabrous skin stimulation, with 67% contributing foci from glabrous skin stimulation and 33% from hairy skin stimulation. In contrast, 100% of the contributing foci to the right PI cluster were from hairy skin stimulation. 100% of foci contributions to the left posterior insula and left PO clusters also came from studies involving hairy skin stimulation. \n\n\n#### Laterality and body part contributions to somatosensory clusters \n  \nSimilarly to the \u201caffective\u201d dataset, low and/or unequal contributions from different body sides and sites limited the statistical power required for refined tests of somatotopic mapping through direct contrasts. Right\u2010side stimulation was predominant in the \u201cdiscriminative\u201d dataset (67% right, 12% left, and 21% both/midline). However, laterality and body part contributions to the three postcentral (putatively somatosensory) clusters yielded by the \u201cdiscriminative\u201d ALE map were examined   post hoc  . Left OP4 (which extended to SI) showed 100% foci contributions from studies in which contralateral body sites were stimulated, with 38% contribution from hand/finger stimulation and 62% contribution from other non\u2010hand sites (  e.g  . arm, foot, leg, wrist, esophagus). Right OP4/1 showed more heterogeneity, with 25% contralateral and 75% ipsilateral contributions, and 32% from hand stimulation and 39% contributions from other sites. The right SI cluster showed 40% foci contributions from studies involving contralateral stimulation and 60% from ipsilateral stimulation, with 100% contributions from studies in which the hand or fingers (glabrous skin) were stimulated. See the Supplementary bibliography for side and site information per study. \n\n\n\n### Meta\u2010Analytic Connectivity Modeling (MCAM) Analysis \n  \nTo discover any task\u2010independent, stimulus\u2010independent, and network\u2010wide functional coactivations with the clusters revealed by the affective and discriminative touch contrast maps, two MCAM analyses were performed [Robinson et al.,  ]. Each used the BrainMap database via Sleuth software ( /). This analysis included 402 experimental contrasts (total   N  \u2009=\u20094913), yielding 6352 foci. Relative to the whole BrainMap database, the profile of the contributing studies reflected a high contribution from the domain categories of action execution, somatosensation, pain, audition, and sexual interoception (see Supporting Information Fig. S2). \n\nFor affective touch, the right PI cluster from the \u201caffective\u2009>\u2009discriminative\u201d contrast was used as a seed for the MCAM analysis. For discriminative touch, the right SI cluster from the \u201cdiscriminative\u2009>\u2009affective\u201d contrast was used as a seed (see Table  ). This resulted in two maps of significantly likely task\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent co\u2010activations across studies: an \u201caffective touch\u201d and a \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d MCAM map (Fig.  ). These maps were then contrasted using GingerALE software, thresholded at pN\u2009<\u20090.01 with a minimum cluster size threshold of 100 mm. A conjunction map was also created, yielding clusters shared by both the \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d MCAM maps. \n  \nTask\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent network co\u2010activation likelihoods as revealed by meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis.   Left panel  : Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation with the posterior insula seed region defined by the affective\u2009>\u2009discriminative touch ALE map, encompassing clusters in somatosensory regions and insula (red; see Table  ). Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation with the primary somatosensory seed region defined by the discriminative\u2009>\u2009affective touch ALE map, encompassing clusters in somatosensory and lateral premotor regions (green; see Table  ).   Right panel  : Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation in common between \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d seed regions, encompassing somatosensory cortices, anterior insula, and medial premotor regions. MCAM analysis included 406 fMRI contrasts (  N  \u2009=\u20094913). All maps thresholded at pN\u2009<\u20090.01, minimum cluster size 100 mm. \n  \nThe \u201caffective\u201d MCAM map yielded two large contiguous clusters (13,552 mm  in the left hemisphere and 11,848 mm  in the right) with significantly high probability of co\u2010activation with the PI seed region. These large bilateral clusters encompassed peaks in posterior and anterior insula, postcentral primary and secondary somatosensory regions, striatum (putamen), thalamus, frontal operculum, and medial prefrontal cortex (dACC, SMA, and pre\u2010SMA). The maximum ALE value for this map was 0.35. \n\nThe \u201cdiscriminative\u201d MCAM map yielded 9 clusters with significantly high probability of co\u2010activation with the SI seed region. The largest (> 1000 mm ) included: left lateral inferior premotor cortices, inferior parietal cortex (area 2/PF), SMA, and bilateral angular gyri, medial prefrontal cortex. The maximum ALE value for this map was 0.30. \n\nThe \u201cconjunction\u201d map between the affective and discriminative MCAM maps yielded 16 clusters. The largest (> 1000 mm ) of these were: left SII/SI, left SMA, bilateral striate cortex, bilateral AI, putamen, thalamus, right caudate nucleus, and right inferior parietal cortex (area 2/PF). See Fig.  . \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis revealed dissociable regions for affective and discriminative tactile stimulation (Fig.  ). Namely, PI is more likely to be activated by touch stimuli with a positive hedonic rating than by tasks involving the detection or discrimination of tactile stimuli. In contrast, SI cortices are more likely to be activated by discriminative than affective touch. Secondary somatosensory cortices in parietal operculum, however, share similar activation likelihoods for both affective and discriminative touch (Fig.  ). \n\nThe MCAM analysis indicated that these dissociable regions also involve dissociable general brain\u2010wide networks (Fig.  ). Affective\u2010touch\u2010specific regions are functionally related to insular networks across a range of studies, while regions more likely to respond in discriminative touch tasks consistently co\u2010activate sensorimotor networks. These dissociable networks also overlap in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, underscoring that affective and discriminative touch recruit common components of a sensory network, despite different activation likelihoods within each tactile dimension. \n\n\n## AFFECTIVE TOUCH AND POSTERIOR INSULA \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis indicated that the posterior insula has a high likelihood of selective activation for touch stimuli associated with positive hedonic ratings. The cluster with high activation likelihood for affective touch in this meta\u2010analysis fell in cytological subdivision Ig2 of granular insular cortex. Alongside adjacent granular subregion Ig1, Ig2 has been broadly implicated in a range of somatosensory, visceral, and nociceptive stimulation in humans [Kurth et al.,  ; Segerdahl et al.,  ]. \n\nIn the past two decades, categorical dichotomies between affective and discriminative touch systems [McGlone et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ] have drawn on anatomical and physiological distinctions between tactile information carried via two relatively distinct affero\u2010spinal pathways. To a great extent, these pathways correspond to the classical \u201clemniscal\u201d and \u201cextralemniscal\u201d pathways. Tactile signaling in the well\u2010studied lemniscal pathway is fast\u2010conducting and spatially acute, projecting via the dorsal column of the spinal cord, with major terminations in postcentral primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, extralemniscal cutaneous tactile signaling involves slowly\u2010conducting, spatially\u2010diffuse coding, with predominant projections via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and major terminations in posterior insula [Andrew,  ; Craig and Zhang,  ]. \n\nThe contribution of the extralemniscal system may be particularly relevant for the affective touch map. This system includes the spinothalamic tract (STT) projections from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to the brain, via specific suprageniculate thalamic nuclei [Craig and Zhang,  ; Friedman and Murray,  ]. This pathway also receives afferent input from skin receptive fields from CTs, a subtype of unmyelinated C afferent nerve which responds to light, moving touch. CT afferents exhibit increased firing frequency to stroking speeds of around 3 cm/s, which are also rated as most pleasant [Ackerley et al.,  ; L\u00f6ken et al.,  ]. A majority (41%) of projections from the STT pathway have a first cortical synapse in granular insula in the macaque [Dum et al.., 2009]. Consistent with the STT as a CT projection pathway [Andrew,  ], a relationship between CT afferent stimulation by light, pleasant touch and PI activation in humans has been indicated by evidence from patient studies [Olausson et al.,  , 2009]. In healthy subjects, PI activation preferentially increases for CT optimal vs. CT\u2010non\u2010optimal stroking speeds [Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et al.,  ,  ; Morrison et al.,  ], which subjects prefer to receive at above\u2010chance levels [Perini et al.,  ]. \n\nThe correlative relationship between a hedonically\u2010positive subjective experience of touch and CT afferent activity may at least partially account for the high likelihood of PI activation in this meta\u2010analysis. However, it is important to note that velocity\u2010dependent CT firing and hedonic processing may be only indirectly related, or related instead to a common cortical\u2010level variable (for example, specific neurotransmitter release) rather than directly related to each other. Blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) activations in PI for CT\u2010targeted touch have consistently failed to correlate with touch pleasantness measures [Ebisch et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Likewise, positive tactile ratings do not necessarily imply CT\u2010related signaling. The affective touch ALE map included contributions from stimulation of the palm skin, where CTs are absent, and palm stimulation has also been associated with subjective touch pleasantness [Etzi et al.,  ; Kl\u00f6cker et al.,  ; L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Yet whether directly or indirectly, the granular region of posterior insular cortex may have a high probability for activation by affective touch by virtue of a critical role in efficient network\u2010wide processing of affectively\u2010relevant somatosensory information [Lovero et al.,  ; Lucas et al., 2014; Perini et al.,  ]. \n\n\n## AFFECTIVE TOUCH AND PARIETAL OPERCULAR REGIONS \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis also revealed that somatosensory regions on the PO have a high likelihood of being activated for affective touch. However, this activation was not selective, in contrast to the PI cluster. Rather, PO had a similar activation likelihood for both affective and discriminative touch, as revealed by a conjunction between the affective and discriminative ALE maps. \n\nThe clusters with highest shared activation likelihood for affective and discriminative touch fell in two subregions of opercular somatosensory cortex, OP1 and OP3 [Baumgartner et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Kurth et al.,  ]. OP1 lies posterior to OP3, and is the likely human homologue of \u201cclassical\u201d secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex in the monkey [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. It responds to innocuous tactile stimuli as well as nociceptive and vestibular stimulation [Zu Eulenburg,  ]. OP3 lies deeper in the Sylvian fissure and is the likely homologue of the primate \u201cventral somatosensory\u201d area (VS), which is not functionally well\u2010characterized [Eickhoff et al.,  ; Krubitzer and Kaas,  ]. It has been speculated that thalamic inputs to SII and PV are modulatory rather than relaying strictly sensory information [Krubitzer and Kaas,  ; Qi et al.,  ]. \n\nGiven its known functional characteristics, how might PO cortex contribute to the processing of positively\u2010valenced touch? One possibility is that its role may involve higher\u2010order aspects of discriminative somatosensory information (for example, sensorimotor, visuomotor, spatial, etc, integration) that is processed in parallel with more general affective network\u2010wide evaluative processing. Another possibility is that PO regions could process certain aspects of affective touch, integrated via direct cortico\u2010cortical connections with more selective populations in nearby PI [zu Eulenberg, etc; Cauda et al.,  ; Cerliani et al.,  ; Deen et al., 2010; Ebisch et al., 2010; Wei and Bao,  [. Though insular and opercular areas have distinct receptive fields and cytological characteristics, they are closely adjacent and highly interconnected [Evrard et al.,  ; zu Eulenburg et al.,  ]. \n\nLike PI, secondary somatosensory cortices on the PO receive major input from the STT, via anatomical projections from ventroposterior inferior (VPI) nucleus, and minor input from the posterior\u2010suprageniculate complex [Po\u2010Sg; Friedman and Murray,  ]. In nonhuman primates such as the macaque (  Macaca mulatta)   and the marmoset (  Callithrix jacchus  ), SII receives major projections from VPI, whereas this is not clearly the case for VS [Qi et al.,  ]. More generally, PO cortex in the macaque receives 29% of STT inputs, in second place behind granular insular cortex [Dum et al.,  ]. \n\nThe role of human SII cortex in affective touch requires further experimental investigation. For example, quantitative rather than qualitative differences may contribute to its nonselective activation likelihood in this analysis. It is also possible that distinct populations within the operculum have varying degrees of specificity with respect to affective touch processing. A hint of such potential heterogeneity was provided by the decomposition of the affective touch map, which revealed an \u201cisland\u201d of disproportionate contribution from glabrous skin stimulation in the right OP3 peak (Fig.  ). \n\n\n## FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS \n  \nIf cortical\u2010level relationships between affective and discriminative touch are highly interpenetrating and context\u2010dependent, as is likely, approaching the cortical mapping solely with respect to stimulus and afferent input classes will yield limited insight. Instead, clues to more specific functional differences lie at the network level. The MCAM analysis assessed functional connectivity through identifying statistically robust whole\u2010brain coactivations with the PI and PO clusters, respectively, across studies in the whole BrainMap database. This approach focuses on co\u2010activation likelihood with respect to regions of interest, rather than to domains, stimuli, or tasks of interest, and thus uncovers network relationships with a high degree of generality. Importantly, though, a high co\u2010activation likelihood   across   experiments also implies a high co\u2010activation likelihood   within   a given subset or domain [Toro et al.,  ], such as somatosensation, Indeed, the profile of the MCAM dataset showed a large contribution from studies in the somatosensory domain (Supporting Information Fig. S2). \n\nThe MCAM analysis revealed that the PI region identified by the affective touch map and the SI region identified by the discriminative touch map are associated with different network\u2010wide activations. A selective \u201caffective touch\u201d network based on the PI seed involves inter\u2010insula activations bilaterally. This suggests that insular processing is a selective driver of affective touch network activation. In contrast, a selective \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d network based on the SI seed involves a wider range of co\u2010activation likelihoods. Many of these fall in premotor regions in inferior lateral frontal, medial frontal, and inferior parietal areas. This implies that SI is pivotal within selective discriminative touch networks associated with sensorimotor processing. \n\nThe regional and network activation likelihood differences here can be tentatively viewed in terms of sensorimotor and \u201csomatovisceral\u201d [Norman et al.,  ] systems, respectively. Sensorimotor networks handle complex integration of tactile and motor processing in order to produce goal\u2010directed or exploratory behavior. In primates, distal effectors (hands and feet) and glabrous surfaces (like palms and lips) loom large in sensorimotor processing, as reflected by their disproportionate representation on cortical sensory and motor maps [Penfield and Boldrey,  ], with scope for dynamic plastic changes during behavior [Schaefer et al.,  ]. Goal\u2010directed and exploratory behaviors are also often visually\u2010guided and occur within peripersonal space, making integrated visual, spatial, and body\u2010centered spatial mapping important. Quick and highly\u2010refined online updating of sensory and motor variables is also crucial for such systems during ongoing behavior. Parietal and premotor circuits are primarily associated with these functions [Gallivan and Culham,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, affective touch may involve broad evaluative appraisals that do not necessarily call for millisecond\u2010scale updates. It also involves the integration of different types of information that influence behavior via affective and motivational dispositions, such as preferences [Perini et al.,  ] or hedonic expectations [Ellingsen et al.,  ; Lovero et al.,  ]. It may also involve autonomic and/or visceral efference within the body, such as changes in heartbeat and respiration, or attenuation of threat anxiety [Coan et al.,  ]. The insula's central involvement in the meta\u2010analysis results is consistent with its role in integrating sensory information into higher\u2010level, subjective representations [Craig,  ], as well as its relationship to autonomic efference [Harrison et al.,  ; Seth and Critchley,  ]. In particular, the posterior\u2010anterior insula axis may contribute to affective evaluation in terms of salience [Menon and Uddin,  ; Pessoa,  ], certainty, and/or risk, as has been postulated for the case of pain [Mouraux et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. \n\nThe MCAM analysis also showed overlap in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. This suggests that whereas regional activation likelihoods may differ depending on stimulus or behavioral parameters, tactile stimulation recruits somatosensory networks regardless of any affective or discriminative bias. For example, although the affective\u2010touch\u2010associated CT pathway may privilege certain information based on specific ranges of speed [L\u00f6ken et al.,  ] and temperature [Ackerley et al.,  ] variables, any tactile stimulation anywhere on the body will also activate the large myelinated A\u03b2 afferents that project predominantly to somatosensory cortices. \n\n\n## VALUE AND LIMITATIONS OF ALE META\u2010ANALYSIS \n  \nALE meta\u2010analysis represents an estimation of the probability of spatial co\u2010activations, based on coordinates reported in the literature. It provides a way of applying statistical thresholds to large sets of coordinate data, in order to identify the most consistently\u2010activated and reproducible activation loci across many studies. Its value thus lies in spatially mapping those activations which survive the numerous differences in methodology, experimental paradigms, scanner hardware, analysis techniques and software, and sample sizes, as well as differences in individual functional neuroanatomy and stereotaxic normalization procedures. In the present meta\u2010analysis, PI and PO emerged as robust and reproducible regions implicated in affective touch, and these results can provide   a priori   hypotheses for further experimental testing. But by the same token, ALE and MCAM meta\u2010analysis filter out less robust or infrequently\u2010reported foci that may have a greater dependence on the details of individual studies. \n\nFor example, here SI showed no significant likelihood of activation for affective touch. However, it has previously been shown to use visuotactile cues to distinguish between videos of male and female strokers during tactile stimulation of the leg [Gazzola et al.,  ], and it receives high\u2010acuity information from the palm, which is an active \u201ctouch\u2010seeking\u201d surface during social interactions [Ackerley et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Further, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) selectively over right SI has slowed reaction times on a go\u2010no go task following affective touch [Bolognini et al..,  ]. The likelihood of activation for SI may increase as the body of literature grows. \n\nOther areas previously implicated in affective touch networks include the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus [STG and STS; Bennett et al.,  ; Gordon et al.,  ; Kaiser et al.,  ; Singh et al.,  ; Voos et al.,  ]. However, any contribution of STS to affective touch has not been sufficient to produce a high likelihood of activation here. Posterior STS regions implicated in caress stimulation have been engaged by social\u2010specific and biological movement information [Deen et al.,  ], as well as polymodal integration [Beauchamp et al.,  ], sensory imagery [Berger and Ehrsson,  ], and convergent auditory and visual facial information [Ghazanfar et al.,  ]. Any role of superior temporal areas may thus lie in the integration of tactile information with sensory and spatial information from other modalities. For example, posterior STS might contribute to structuring a coherent representation of the touch by via visuospatial imagery for tactile biological motion [Kilintari et al.,  ]. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nThe different activation likelihoods for affective and discriminative touch render it improbable that \u201cdiscriminative\u201d (  e.g  . primary) somatosensory regions are sufficient for affective touch processing. Depending on the context, tactile stimulation may enlist spatially and temporally acute, goal\u2010directed sensorimotor guidance of behavior, or contribute to context\u2010dependent, hedonic or emotional appraisals with influences on bodily regulation. The former is more likely to recruit classical \u201cdiscriminative\u201d cortical sensory regions and networks; while the latter is more likely to recruit insular and PO cortices. However, this does not imply a wholesale distinction between affective and discriminative touch. Rather, cortical processing of the relevant stimulus and task properties may fall along a continuum, with the categories \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d at the extremes. Or, like pain, they may represent experimentally dissociable dimensions despite operating together inextricably during normal processing [\u201csensory\u201d and \u201caffective\u201d components; Kulkarni et al.,  ; Rainville et al.,  ]. In daily life, tactile interactions with other people may prompt both simultaneously, providing means for not only reaching out and touching someone, but also for feeling and evaluating their touches in return. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"id": 5066805, "text_md5": "6d279c08081991d27d1c7f4b5e0e407f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 15], "journal": [16, 30], "publication_year": [32, 36], "title": [47, 143], "keywords": [157, 309], "abstract": [322, 2366], "body": [2375, 42617]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 26873519, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.23103", "pmcid": "5066805", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066805", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5066805"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066805\">5066805</a>", "list_title": "PMC5066805  ALE meta\u2010analysis reveals dissociable networks for affective and discriminative aspects of touch"}

Here we look at anticipation of monetary gain and loss contrasted with neutral anticipation. We meta-analysed data from 15 original whole-brain group maps (  n  \u2009=\u2009346) and report extensive areas of relative activation and deactivation throughout the whole brain. For both anticipation of gain and loss we report robust activation of the striatum, activation of key nodes of the putative salience network, including anterior cingulate and anterior insula, and more complex patterns of activation and deactivation in the central executive and default networks. On between-group comparison, we found significantly greater relative deactivation in the left inferior frontal gyrus associated with incentive valence. This meta-analysis provides a robust whole-brain map of a reward anticipation network in the healthy human brain. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s11065-018-9385-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nReward processing in the brain is an iterative learning process involving goal-directed behaviour and adaptive decision-making in response to a stimulus. Stimulus presentation followed by receipt of reward increases the likelihood of a behaviour occurring again. A reward stimulus (incentive) has an intrinsic value (valence) which makes it salient, standing out from a background of stimulus bombardment. Incentives may be innately rewarding to an organism (e.g. sex, food), known as intrinsic rewards, or may be neutral at first and learnt by association, known as extrinsic rewards (e.g. money). The anticipation of a reward incentive prepares an approach behaviour, creating motivational salience, and the consumption of the reward reinforces motivational salience. \n\nThe neural mechanism of reward processing is beginning to be understood. Physiological work in primates revealed that reward prediction is mediated by dopaminergic neurons in the striatum (Schultz et al.  ). Moreover a putative salience network has been identified by functional connectivity analysis (Seeley et al.  ) which may be involved in choosing stimuli worthy of attention from a continuous stream of internally and externally generated inputs to the brain, thought to be anchored in the anterior cingulate and anterior insula (Uddin  ). \n\nThe monetary incentive delay task is a widely used and validated reward processing task adapted for use in human fMRI studies to investigate motivational salience processes in health and disease. It was developed based on instrumental conditioning paradigms employed in animal studies (Schultz et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ). The monetary incentive delay task allows reward processing to be parsed into at least two distinct components, namely, \u2018anticipation\u2019 and \u2018feedback\u2019. Typically, the task consists of a sequence of three visual stimulus events (Fig.\u00a0 ), (1)   anticipation,   a learned visual cue representing valence (e.g. financial gain-circle, loss-square, neutral-triangle) which elicits motivational salience, (2)   the target  , another learned visual cue (e.g. rectangle) to initiate the behaviour, usually pressing a button on time (a time-dependent motor task), and (3)   feedback   in the form of text or image indicating consummation (financial gain, loss, neutral) and dependent on performance.   \nExample of visual cues presented during a trial of the monetary incentive delay task \n  \n\nWhen studied with fMRI, the two main phases when imaging data are acquired include (1) during and after the first visual stimulus (anticipation/motivational salience) and (2) during and after the third visual stimulus (feedback/consummation). Because of individual variation in performance, the duration of target presentation may be adjusted automatically within the program such that each participant experiences approximately the same success rates, usually set at around 66%. Typically, there are three main anticipation conditions, win, neutral or lose. The anticipation conditions are coupled with five main feedback conditions dependent on type of anticipation and performance (e.g. target hit or missed), namely, 1) anticipation-win-hit, 2) anticipation-win-miss, 3) anticipation-lose-hit, 4) anticipation-lose-miss and 5) anticipation-neutral. The neutral anticipation stimulus is used as a contrast to control for aspects of visual and motor processing commonly engaged during the different conditions. There are multiple variations that can be introduced, but in this meta-analysis we focus only on the anticipation conditions stimulating positive, neutral and negative salience through monetary gain or loss. \n\nThe original investigations of the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults (Knutson et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ) reported that anticipation of reward (versus neutral) was associated with activation of multiple regions including areas implicated in both reward prediction (bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate and left putamen) and the salience network (bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate gyrus). \n\nSince the original studies, many more studies have used the monetary incentive delay task to investigate brain networks engaged in reward processing. The monetary incentive delay task has mainly been used to study differences between demographic groups (e.g. adolescents and adults, males and females), clinical populations (e.g.   major   depression, psychosis) or interventions (e.g. placebo). Several whole-brain meta-analyses have been conducted looking at reward anticipation in healthy adults using a variety of tasks and a mixture of different rewards, such as monetary, food, points, social feedback and pleasing images (Liu et al.  ; Diekhof et al.  ; Bartra et al.  ). We identified only two meta-analyses focusing on reward anticipation in healthy adults using solely the monetary incentive delay task. The first meta-analysis of healthy adults using the monetary incentive delay task alone (Knutson et al.  ) contrasted anticipation win directly with anticipation lose, whereas the second, more recent meta-analyses (Oldham et al.  ) contrasted both win and lose with neutral conditions. Both analyses found that regions implicated in reward prediction and the salience network were activated. \n\nAll of the aforementioned meta-analyses, including the two focusing only on the reward processing in healthy adults employed the activation likelihood estimation technique (Turkeltaub et al.  ) using published text coordinates. However, coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches cannot fully account for within study and random between study variation, because they do not include the full statistical images and exclude null findings unlike image-based meta-analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). Coordinate-based methods such as activation likelihood estimation treat all foci of activation equally regardless of the strength of activation, and it has been shown that there is a poor similarity between coordinate and image based meta-analysis (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.  ). The seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analytic technique (Radua et al.  ) offers significant benefits over activation likelihood estimation, because it allows both thresholded coordinates and original group map image data to be combined creating maps effect-size. Furthermore, activation likelihood estimation and SDM answer slightly different questions. While the results of activation likelihood estimation-based meta-analysis may be interpreted as indicating the spatial convergence of previous findings, seed-based d mapping-based can be interpreted as direct increase or decrease in activity in the brain (M\u00fcller et al.  ). \n\nThe primary objective of this study was to conduct a whole brain meta-analysis of fMRI studies employing only the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults using the seed-based d mapping technique to investigate which brain regions are activated or deactivated during monetary reward anticipation. We specifically focused on the contrasts anticipation-win minus anticipation-neutral (AWAN) and anticipation-lose minus anticipation-neutral (ALAN), to confirm activation of regions implicated in reward processing, namely reward prediction and the salience networks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search Strategy and Study Selection \n  \nOn 15/12/14 we searched the NICE Healthcare Database including EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) using the terms ((\u201cmonetary\u201d AND \u201cincentive\u201d AND \u201cdelay\u201d AND \u201cfmri\u201d).ti,ab OR (\u201cmonetary\u201d AND (\u201creward\u201d OR \u201cincentiv*\u201d OR \u201canticipat*\u201d) AND \u201cfmri\u201d).ti,ab) AND \u201carticle\u201d [Limit to: Publication Year 2000\u20132014]. We complemented this with a cross-reference search of Pubmed on 16/12/14 with the general search term \u201cmonetary reward incentive anticipation fMRI\u201d. Study inclusion criteria were (i) inclusion of healthy adults, (ii) used fMRI, (iii) used Monetary Incentive Delay Task, (iv) article available in English, (v) published in a peer-reviewed journal, (vi) conditions and contrasts of interest included, (vii) whole-brain analysis reported. We also included the placebo condition of intervention studies in healthy participants meeting criteria. Full articles were read and excluded if the above inclusion criteria were not met. The search was repeated using the same search terms and databases on 19/1/17, ranging from December 2014 onwards and excluding any repeated articles. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nFor all the articles that satisfied study inclusion criteria, all authors or corresponding authors were contacted by published email address in March 2015 requesting whole brain maps. Research groups who sent maps were included in the Monetary incentive delay Task Analysis Consortium (MTAC) (Supplementary References 1). If no maps were available for use, we manually extracted the whole-brain only coordinates from the published article for the conditions of interest for the healthy adult sample. For all articles (both maps-received and coordinates only), information on the MRI scanner, scanning sequence and timings, parameters of the monetary incentive delay task and performance data where available were extracted manually by two researchers (Colizzi and Wilson) and cross-checked for errors. This process of contacting authors was repeated for a follow-up literature search in March 2017. If no maps were available, we did not extract published article because of positive effect-size bias detected in the first round (see Results). \n\n\n### Data Analysis: Seed-Based D Mapping \n  \nMeta-analysis was carried out using the seed-based d mapping software employing previously described methods (Radua et al.  ; Radua and Mataix-Cols  ; Radua et al.  ,  ). In brief, the aim of seed-based d mapping is to create voxel-level maps of effect-size measured as Hedge\u2019s\u00a0g allowing modelling of both positive and negative activations on the same map. For each reported peak coordinate and value (t, z or p), seed-based d mapping ensures surrounding voxels have a similar but smaller estimated effect size by multiplication with an un-normalised Gaussian kernel. If a voxel should have a value assigned from more than one coordinate, the values are averaged weighting by the square of the distance to each close peak. The data from each study are then weighted by the inverse of the sum of variance plus between study variance and combined using the random effects model DerSimonian-Laird estimator (DerSimonian and Laird  ). This approach allows for studies with a larger sample size or lower variability to contribute more and creates a map of heterogeneity. \n\nManually extracted whole-brain coordinates and group maps were formatted for seed-based d mapping. For coordinates, this involved conversion to Tailarach, for group maps conversion to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format, left-right correction and preprocessing including reslicing data into a common voxel size by interpolation (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u200920\u00a0mm). Meta-analysis produced mean maps with non-overlapping clusters of activation and deactivation for each contrast. A non-parametric approach was used where   p  -values and seed-based d mapping z-scores were created by randomisation, as opposed to standard z-scores. \n\nIn neuroimaging analyses, as well as in meta-analyses, the need for appropriate statistical thresholding to minimize the extent of false positive results must be balanced against the need for avoiding false negatives (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). Typically, neuroimaging meta-analyses control for the false discovery rate to minimize false positive results, which we have also reported. However, it is worth noting that the choice of threshold is best guided by the specific research context (M\u00fcller et al.  ). In the present study, we did not employ the conventional threshold, but instead combined an intensity threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.005) with a cluster extent threshold (cluster >10 voxels) that has been shown to result in acceptable Type II error rates (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). \n\nThus seed-based d mapping generated mean maps were thresholded at the validated default settings p\u2009<\u20090.005, seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091.0, cluster>10 voxels. In seed-based d mapping, using a cluster size of 10 voxels and an uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.005 has been shown empirically to be equivalent to corrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.05, optimally balancing sensitivity and specificity, and seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091 reduces the false positive rate (Radua et al.  ). Given 100% parametric maps, this results in 100% sensitivity and a 3.5% false positive rate to produce the final whole brain maps of statistical significance, accompanied by an HTML document of main peaks,   p   value, seed-based d mapping-z-score, MNI coordinates, number of voxels per cluster and significant sub-peaks within each cluster (also with p value and seed-based d mapping-z-score). All results at the default seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091 threshold are reported in the supplementary material for the interested reader, however in the main text we have reported only those results that survived a more conservative threshold (z-score\u2009\u2265\u20095.0). The \u20185-sigma\u2019 threshold for significance (Horton  ) is a consensus agreement in other scientific disciplines, reflecting five standard deviations from the mean, or   p  \u2009<\u20090.0000003). We have adopted this threshold in order to further minimize the probability of detecting an effect by chance and to identify the most critical regions involved in motivational salience, reflecting high confidence that these are true positives when contrasting anticipation win or loss with neutral. \n\nJacknife sensitivity analysis of replicability, analysis of heterogeneity and publication bias are automated within the seed-based d mapping program. Jacknife analysis involves re-analysing mean maps multiple times by leaving out a single study each time. In order to interpret the many Jacknife mean maps, we thresholded for significance, binarized the data and combined into a single overlapping density map of significant data. This allowed visual inspection of areas of low density, signifying lower replicability across studies. Inter-study heterogeneity was calculated in which Q  statistics are converted to standard z values to create a map. This map was overlaid on the final mean map for visual inspection of areas of overlapping significant heterogeneity with areas of thresholded activation or deactivation. Publication bias was estimated using standard funnel plots and Egger\u2019s test for each reported peak. The funnel plots consisted of effect-size on the x-axis and standard error on the y-axis with bias tested using Egger\u2019s test for asymmetry of the funnel plot. \n\nThe anatomical location of the peaks were identified using the Atlas of the Human Brain and associated BrainNavigator program (Mai et al.  ). As the atlas did not cover the cerebellum, so the Talairach Daemon (Lancaster et al.  ; Lancaster et al.  ) was used, following MNI to Talairach conversion. \n\nFollowing mean map analysis, the two contrasts AWAN and ALAN were compared using the automated linear model analysis which calculates the between-group difference based on statistical significance after Monte Carlo randomisation. In order to study potential confounders, automated linear model meta-regression was calculated, whereby the difference between the minimum and maximum values of regressors are returned with statistical significance based on Monte Carlo randomisation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFollowing removal of duplicates, and screening of abstracts, from an initial list of 288 articles a final selection of 108 articles were eligible for inclusion. We contacted all corresponding authors for the 108 articles of whom 70 responded. Brain maps corresponding to 36 articles were received. Of these, 21 were excluded for reasons detailed in the Prisma flow diagram (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nPRISMA flow diagram \n  \n\nIn total 15 sets of whole brain group maps were included in the meta-analysis of anticipation (Supplementary Table 1). Thirty-three articles were included in the first stage of the meta-analysis including 18 sets of whole-brain coordinates extracted from the text (Supplementary Table 1). No additional maps were included on repeating the literature search two years later. The omnibus sample size for all 33 non-overlapping samples (maps and text coordinates) was 728 healthy adults, mean age 30.3\u00a0years (SD 7.81), 60.6% male, and 98.8% right-handed (Table  ). See Supplementary Tables\u00a01, 2 and 3 for full demographics, monetary incentive delay task specifics and fMRI acquisition and analysis for each study.   \nSummary of available demographics for omnibus data of coordinates and group maps combined and of group maps only \n  \npooled SD excluding datasets where no SD reported;  mean of available data, only 25/33 sets total: 24/32 AW, 21/21 AL \n  \n\nAn initial omnibus analysis combined group maps and published text coordinates. However, we found significant bias for the two most significant peaks of the AWAN and ALAN contrasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Table 4). Given this finding and the theoretical discrepancies between coordinate and image-based meta-analysis previously discussed, we report only the   group map   meta-analysis from here on (Supplementary Table 5). \n\n### Anticipation Win Minus Anticipation Neutral \n  \nThis contrast was examined in a total sample size of 274 participants (Table  ). \n\n#### Activation \n  \nEleven main peaks in eleven clusters were identified (size: 10 to 25,114 voxels, z-score: 3.967 to 9.798, Table  , Fig.\u00a0 ). Eight main peaks and 144 subpeaks exceeded z\u2009=\u20095.0. The main peak of largest cluster was located in the right superior frontal gyrus lateral part extending widely to include, amongst 140 subpeaks, the caudate and putamen bilaterally, left fundus region of caudate (proximate to nucleus accumbens) and right nucleus accumbens. The remaining main peaks z\u2009>\u20095.0 were bilateral middle frontal gyri, bilateral inferior temporal gyri, left paracentral lobule, left occipital gyrus and left parahippocampal gyrus.   \nAnticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral main peaks for SDM z-score\u2009>\u20095\u2009or <\u2009\u22125 \n  \nMNI (Montreal Neurological Institute), SDM-z (Signed Differential Mapping z-score), FDR (false discovery rate) \n    \nMean maps thresholded to signed differential mapping z-score\u2009>\u20095. Top row - anticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral with activation in red. Middle row - anticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral with deactivation in blue. Bottom row - anticipation lose-vs-anticipation neutral with activation in red \n  \n\n\n#### Deactivation \n  \nThirteen main peaks in thirteen clusters were identified (size: 36\u20134857 voxels, z-score: 1.022\u20136.434, Table  , Fig.  ). Two main peaks and one subpeak exceeded z\u2009=\u20095 located in the right superior temporal gyrus and left angular gyrus. \n\n\n\n### Anticipation Lose Minus Anticipation Neutral \n  \nThis contrast was examined in a combined sample of 246 participants (Table  ). \n\n#### Activation \n  \nWe found nineteen main peaks (z-score: 3.947\u20136.801, size: 12\u201311,315 voxels, Table  , Fig.  ). Seven main peaks and 65 subpeaks exceeded z\u2009=\u20095.0 (Supplementary 4.3). The main peak of the largest cluster was located in the left superior frontal gyrus medial part extending widely to include, amongst 47 subpeaks, bilateral putamen and right caudate. In descending order, other main peaks z\u2009>\u20095 .0 were located in the left parieto-occipital transition zone, right supramarginal gyrus (2 main peaks), left hippocampus CA1, right fusiform gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus.   \nAnticipation lose-vs-anticipation neutral main peaks for SDM z-score\u2009>\u20095\u2009<\u2009\u22125 \n  \nMNI (Montreal Neurological Institute), SDM-z (Signed Differential Mapping z-score), FDR (false discovery rate) \n  \n\n\n#### Deactivation \n  \nNo main peaks exceeded the raised threshold z\u2009>\u20095, though multiple peaks were significant (Supplementary Table 5.a-d for full breakdown). \n\n\n\n### Between Group Comparison: AWAN Minus ALAN \n  \nOn between-group linear model comparison between AWAN and ALAN, we found significantly greater   deactivation   in AWAN compared to ALAN in the left inferior frontal gyrus opercular part (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table 6).   \nBetween group comparison of anticipation win-vs-neutral minus anticipation lose-vs-neutral showing relative deactivation in blue \n  \n\n\n### Publication Bias, Heterogeneity, Sensitivity and Confounders \n  \nFunnel plots revealed no clear evidence of marked asymmetry on visual inspection for the higher thresholded main peaks for either contrast (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), also surviving Egger\u2019s test for bias (Tables\u00a0  &  ). Maps of significant heterogeneity (Q ) were overlaid on the mean maps for both contrasts to visually inspect for overlapping areas (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). For AWAN significant heterogeneity overlapped with activation in the bilateral ventral striatum and bilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei. For ALAN, overlap was seen in bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus and the left precentral gyrus. Visual inspection of Jacknife analysis overlaid on the heterogeneity maps showed good replicability of all areas reported in both contrasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). \n\nOutside of the task conditions, two independent regressors were available, namely, placebo intervention and scanner strength. Seventy of the 274 (26%) subjects in AWAN and 59 of the 246 (24%) in ALAN were given placebo (wash-out period 1 to 2\u00a0weeks). Overlaying heterogeneity maps for each contrast with meta-regression for placebo showed overlap with activation in AWAN in the bilateral ventral striatum, but no visual overlap in the ALAN contrast (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 8). \n\nRegarding field strength, for AWAN 7 of 14 mean maps were generated using a 3\u00a0T scanner, for ALAN 5 of 11 maps were 3\u00a0T and the remainder for both 1.5\u00a0T. No areas of overlap in heterogeneity corresponded to areas of activation or deactivation in the mean maps (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05, Supplementary Table 9). \n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate which regions of the brain are robustly engaged by reward processing in healthy adult humans, specifically looking at motivational salience, that is, presentation of reward incentive and preparation of approach behaviour. Using all available fMRI group-map data for the anticipation of reward and loss conditions of the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adult humans, our meta-analysis shows that there are large areas of both   activation   and   deactivation   across the whole brain in motivational salience. For the first time, we report the pattern of deactivation in anticipation of reward in the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adult humans. We also report evidence of positive effect-size bias in the anterior cingulate (AWAN) and striatum (AWAN and ALAN) in the literature. \n\nThe results presented here are consistent with those reported in a recent activation likelihood estimation based meta-analysis of reward anticipation using the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults (Oldham et al.  ), but we report far more extensive areas of activation involving frontal, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions. Furthermore, we have reported on areas of relative deactivation as well as publication bias, heterogeneity, replicability, and the potential effects of placebo and scanner strength. \n\nWe have confirmed a number of regions of activation reported in the original monetary incentive delay task studies of healthy adults (Knutson et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ) for AWAN, including bilateral insula (left insula originally reported as motor cortex), right nucleus accumbens, nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate, left putamen, thalamus, right amygdala, right anterior cingulate gyrus (both reported as \u2018right mesial prefrontal cortex\u2019), right superior frontal gyrus medial part (reported as \u2018right SMA\u2019) and right cerebellum anterior lobe culmen (reported as cerebellar vermis). However, we did not find any activation in the right amygdala or left nucleus accumbens, an area of significant heterogeneity. We have also greatly extended the pattern of activity such that all previous unilateral peaks, except right amygdala, were found to be bilateral including putamen, superior frontal gyrus (medial and lateral), anterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum anterior lobe culmen, and thalamic nuclei. We have provided greater resolution within the thalamus itself, finding activation in bilateral medial dorsal thalamic nuclei and two left ventral anterior thalamic nuclei. We report nine additional bilateral areas of activation including middle frontal gyri and inferior temporal gyri, precentral gyri, frontal operculae, paracingulate cortex, postcentral gyri, superior parietal lobules, precunei and insular gyri. We report twenty additional unilateral areas of activation (5 main peaks) including areas known to be implicated in both salience processing, such as the hippocampus (Crottaz-Herbette et al.  ), and reward processing, such as the right parahippocampal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (Brooks et al.  ). \n\n\n### Interpretation \n  \nAs predicted, the striatum is strongly engaged in both anticipation of reward and loss, though not clearly differentiated when comparing the two contrasts. We found significant heterogeneity in this area in the anticipation of reward across all studies which may be explained in part by placebo effects. \n\nBoth reward and loss anticipation robustly engage key nodes of the salience network including anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortex. However, a mixed picture emerged for the anterior cingulate with anticipation of reward strongly activating bilateral anterior cingulate with a single main peak of deactivation in the left anterior cingulate. In contrast, anticipation of loss strongly activated the left anterior cingulate only with no detected deactivation. This pattern of activation may be reflected in the AWAL between-group comparison (Supplementary Table 6) showing a subthreshold (cluster size 8 voxels) difference in activation in the left anterior cingulate. The anterior insula was activated bilaterally in both contrasts. The insula cortex is considered a major cortical target of ascending interoceptive and visceromotor signals passing through thalamic nuclei (Uddin  ) found to be functionally connected to amygdala, dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus peri-aqueductal grey matter (Seeley et al.  ). We confirmed activity in these regions, though seemingly a different pattern for each contrast (AWAN - bilateral dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, right periaqueductal grey matter; ALAN - right posterior hypothalamic area, left basomedial nucleus of the amygdala). \n\nThe right anterior insular cortex, in particular, is also thought to be involved in switching between two other networks, namely, the central-executive and the default-mode networks (Sridharan et al.  ). The central-executive network is considered the neural substrate underlying cognitive processes such as inhibition, interference control, working memory and cognitive flexibility (Diamond  ) and is thought to be anchored in the dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral parietal cortex (Sridharan et al.  ). We found strong bilateral activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in both contrasts in the bilateral middle frontal gyri and bilateral superior frontal gyri, lateral part. Regarding the lateral parietal cortex we found significant but differing patterns of activation for each contrast. In both conditions, there was bilateral activation of the superior parietal lobule and unilateral activation of the right angular gyrus. However in AWAN there was   unilateral   activation of the left supramarginal gyrus and deactivation in the   left   angular gyrus, and in ALAN   bilateral   activation of the supramarginal gyrus and unilateral deactivation of the   right   angular gyrus. \n\nThe default-mode network is considered a state of cortical activity independent of external stimuli (originally considered to be \u2018waking rest\u2019) convergent with areas active in resting state fMRI (Andrews-Hanna et al.  ) and task-induced deactivation (Andrews-Hanna,  ). This network has been further subdivided into a \u2018core\u2019 anchored in the posterior cingulate cortex and anteromedial prefrontal cortex, as well as the \u2018medial temporal\u2019 and\u2019 dorsal medial subsystems\u2019 (Andrews-Hanna  ). The core is associated with self-referential processes, the medial temporal subsystem corresponds to past and future autobiographical thought, episodic memory and contextual retrieval, and the dorsal medial subsystem corresponds to social cognition, story comprehension and semantic processing (Yeo et al.  ). We found bilateral activation of the \u2018core\u2019 posterior cingulate in both anticipation contrasts. Regarding the medial temporal subsystem, we observed a differing pattern of activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex with unilateral activation of the right posterior orbital gyrus in AWAN and unilateral activation of the left intermediate orbital gyrus in ALAN. In AWAN in the medial temporal lobe, there was bilateral deactivation in the parahippocampal gyrus in conjunction with unilateral activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Yet in ALAN we reported unilateral activation of the left hippocampus CA1 region. With respect to the dorsomedial subsystem, on the one hand we found robust bilateral activation of the superior frontal gyrus, lateral part in both contrasts. On the other hand, we saw a mixed picture in the lateral temporal cortex. The inferior temporal gyrus was activated in both contrasts. In AWAN, there was activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, deactivation in the right middle gyrus and deactivation in the right superior temporal gyrus. In ALAN there was activation in the left middle temporal gyrus, deactivation in bilateral middle temporal gyri and deactivation in the left superior temporal gyrus. \n\nThe monetary incentive delay task is also a motor processing task and, as such, we observed broad bilateral activation of primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), somatosensory cortex (post central gyrus), the supplementary motor area and multiple thalamic nuclei in both contrasts. The striatal region of the basal ganglia was activated, but no peaks were seen in the globus pallidus or subthalamic nuclei. Significant activity was also found in the cerebellum. In AWAN there was strong activation in bilateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum and a peak of deactivation in the right posterior lobe, but in ALAN a mixed picture of unilateral activation and deactivation in the right anterior lobe. It is known that there is an important function for the cerebellum in motivational salience, in keeping with a recent animal study (Cutando et al.  ) suggesting a role in encoding expectation of reward, the growing understanding of the reciprocal connections between cerebellum and basal ganglia (Niendam et al.  ) and cerebellar involvement in addiction (Moulton et al.  ). \n\nThese observed patterns of activation are controlled by the neutral condition in which the only theoretical difference in task activation is the absence of motivational salience. Could it be that common areas of activation and deactivation are part of a motivational salience network, robustly engaging the striatum, salience network, parts of the central executive and default networks and associated motor regions? The picture emerging from the central executive and default network appears more complicated with robust activation in the posterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but a differing pattern emerging between anticipation of reward and loss in the lateral parietal cortex, ventromedial cortex, medial (including hippocampus) and lateral temporal cortex. \n\n\n### Between-group comparisons \n  \nThe first meta-analysis of healthy controls discussed earlier compared uncontrolled anticipation of reward directly with loss (Knutson and Greer  ). We used a different approach (between-group linear model) comparing mean group maps for two controlled conditions, AWAN and ALAN. We report only one significant peak above threshold in the left inferior frontal gyrus operculum. This region was deactivated in both conditions, but significantly more deactivated in anticipating loss than reward. Additionally, the left anterior cingulate gyrus was active in both contrasts, significantly more so anticipating reward than while anticipating loss, but just under threshold (Supplementary Table 6). The left inferior frontal gyrus has previously been implicated in response inhibition (Swick et al.  ; Bhattacharyya et al.  ) and the attribution of aspects of stimulus salience and attentional allocation of resources (Seeley et al.  ; Bhattacharyya et al.  ; Downar et al.  ). Might this left inferior frontal activation reflect differential allocation of cognitive resources according to motivational salience or could this directly reflect a representation of valence? \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur findings are limited by the reported sample demographics, constraints of the monetary incentive delay task, the data acquisition and analysis, the methods of meta-analysis and the brain atlas used. Across all the studies, we were only able to report sample size, age, gender and handedness. Other variables such as substance use, education, IQ, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were too inconsistently reported for any meaningful interpretation. \n\nIn terms of the monetary incentive delay task, there was significant variation across designs. The maps we received were from many different international locations including Europe, the USA, Japan and South Korea. Therefore the financial incentive could have different meanings to different samples, although superficially they appear to be similarly small amounts of money. There was inconsistent reporting of, and variation in, the duration of all the phases of each trial, including monetary incentive stimulus presentation, anticipation, target, feedback and inter-stimulus interval. The data are gathered over multiple trials varying from 44 to 180 in each study, and the target hit rate was either unreported or varied from 50% to 75% which could have influenced any neural substrate for the temporally bound reward prediction error signal. The monetary incentive delay task is not designed to capture temporal learning or any reward prediction error signal. Variants of the monetary incentive delay task have been developed that introduce contingency, varying the predictability of reward receipt following action, and we have included a single group map in the AWAN condition introducing this (Li et al.  ). Lastly, overall performance data was not consistently reported, preventing meaningful behavioural interpretation. \n\nRegarding data acquisition and analysis, a variety of scanners and sequences were used in each study. There was variation in acquisition and echo time, number and thickness of slices, resolution and analysis software. All of these are documented in Supplementary Table 3 for reference. Only two potential confounders were available for statistical analysis, scanner strength and placebo condition, though meta-regression and comparison with heterogeneity and mean maps did not suggest any significant effects on our results. \n\nThe most important limitation to our method was the exclusion of over half of the studies. We felt this to be an essential step after identification of the positive effect-size bias in published coordinate-based data. The main peaks of the omnibus analysis (text coordinates and group maps) are reported in Supplementary Table 4 for reference. Secondly, because we found such a large number of significant peaks, we could not report all the data generated by this meta-analysis and applied a very conservative threshold. Subsequently, on the one hand, we feel our results are extremely robust, but on the other, many regions which may be of interest are not discussed. However, all these data are recorded in the Supplementary Table 5. \n\nIn terms of the between-group linear model comparison of AWAN and ALAN, there was a difference in gender proportion between AWAN (78%) and ALAN (71%), though this effect just fails to achieve nominal significance (\u03c72 (1)\u2009=\u20093.34,   p  \u2009=\u20090.07). However, 10 of the 15 studies (  n  \u2009=\u2009194) for which we received group maps, sent both AWAN and ALAN contrasts, such that the majority of the data was repeated-measures within-group, strengthening the results. \n\nFinally, the brain atlas used for anatomical location, while strong on detail, is based on the dissection of a single 24\u00a0year old male brain and does not cover the cerebellum necessitating additional use of the Tailarach Daemon. \n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this image-based meta-analysis uses data from a large sample of healthy individuals and reveals robust engagement of brain areas that have previously been linked to the anticipation of reward as well as novel brain areas, providing a definitive map of the reward anticipation network in the healthy human brain. \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 6327084, "text_md5": "ecb9173c2dd53d622e60f9de9bf72085", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 141], "journal": [142, 158], "publication_year": [160, 164], "title": [175, 299], "keywords": [313, 400], "abstract": [413, 1527], "body": [1536, 38802]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30255220, "doi": "10.1007/s11065-018-9385-5", "pmcid": "6327084", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6327084", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6327084"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6327084\">6327084</a>", "list_title": "PMC6327084  The Neural Substrate of Reward Anticipation in Health: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Findings in the Monetary Incentive Delay Task"}

However, findings on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie smoking-related and smoking-unrelated reward processing in smokers have been inconsistent. Neuroimaging experiments that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reported brain responses to smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers and healthy controls as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space were identified by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to December 2018. Three meta-analyses were performed using random-effect nonparametric statistics with Seed-based d Mapping software, with brain activity contrast from individual studies as the input. The striatum showed higher activation in response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues in 816 smokers from 28 studies and lower activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in 275 smokers compared with 271 healthy control individuals from 13 studies. The relative reactivity of the putamen to smoking-related cues increased in 108 smokers compared with 107 healthy controls from seven studies. Meta-regression showed that smokers with a greater severity of nicotine dependence exhibited less engagement of the striatum in response to both smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues. The present results reveal the disruption of reward system function in smokers and provide new insights into diverging theories of addiction. With the escalation of nicotine dependence, nicotine appears to exert dynamic effects on reward processing, based on incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing disorder and one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death. More than 16 million Americans live with smoking-related diseases, and >480,000 people die from smoking every year. Approximately 1 in 5 deaths are attributable to smoking . Given the current situation, yearly smoking-related deaths are expected to rise to 8 million by 2030 . Although most smokers report a desire to quit, the majority of attempts fail within 10 days . Numerous studies reported that craving that is induced by smoking-related cues is responsible for the failure to quit and high rates of relapse . One core characteristic of addiction is the disruption of reward processing , which influences decision-making and leads to smoking behavior . The relationship between alterations of reward processing and nicotine dependence has been well demonstrated, but no consensus has been reached on the neurobiological substrates that underling smoking-related and nonsmoking reward-related processing. \n\nAccording to incentive sensitization theory, repeated pairings between smoking-related cues (e.g., cigarette packs, lighters, and smoking-related pictures and videos) and smoking itself increase the dopaminergic response to these nonpharmacological cues, ultimately conferring heightened incentive properties to these stimuli . Neural systems that subserve reward-related learning, primarily represented in the striatum, are hijacked by reward cues and related contexts that predict the availability of smoking, resulting in higher responsivity to smoking-related cues and relatively lower responsivity to nonsmoking reward-related cues. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), based on the contrast of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, several studies investigated brain activation in response to smoking-related stimuli compared with neutral cues in smokers. Using a cue exposure task, Baker et al. found that smokers exhibited heightened reward responsiveness to cigarette rewards relative to monetary rewards . A cohort study that used an incentive-processing task found that individuals who smoked more cigarettes per day exhibited lower right nucleus accumbens reactivity to a nonsmoking reward . \n\nIn contrast to incentive sensitization theory, reward deficiency syndrome theory proposes that addicts exhibit general deficits in the recruitment of brain reward pathways, resulting in the chronic hypoactivation of these circuits in response to both drug- and nondrug-related reward . Several studies support this proposition. For example, dependent smokers exhibited equivalently low reward system activity in response to both reward types . An fMRI study revealed that smokers exhibited lower brain reactivity, especially in reward-related brain regions (e.g., caudate and putamen), to nontobacco reward-related stimuli (e.g., favorite food) compared with nonsmokers . Another study investigated the association between the severity of nicotine dependence and the response to monetary rewards and found that the intensity of nicotine craving among smokers was linked to lower sensitivity to nondrug-related rewards . The threshold of reward has been shown to increase as addiction develops, expressed by higher drug tolerance. \n\nThese divergent results may be attributable to different cue exposure paradigms and different fMRI parameters. Furthermore, small sample sizes hamper the ability to distinguish general activation patterns. A qualitative meta-analysis by Engelmann et al. (2012) reported activation of the precuneus, cingulate gyrus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum when smokers were presented with smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues . However, these authors only included smokers and did not make comparisons with healthy controls. A more complete analysis is needed to understand the neural processing of smoking-related cues in smokers and differences from healthy controls. The present study investigated specific smoking-related activation patterns compared with neutral cues in smokers and compared brain activity in response to smoking-related cues between smokers and healthy controls. We also compared brain activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers and healthy controls. We sought to provide an overall reward processing profile of neural substrates in smokers. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nCandidate studies for the cue reactivity meta-analysis were identified by searching the PubMed (Medline), Embase, and Web of Science databases. The combination of search terms included (i) smok* (smoking, smoker, cigarette, tobacco, nicotine) AND (ii) fMRI (e.g., neuroimaging, brain imaging, BOLD, fMRI, MRI, brain reactivity, neutral reactivity) AND (cue reactivity [cue, smoking-related, smoking cues] OR reward [money, reward, monetary, gain]). The time span for the included studies was from 1 January 2000 to 31 November 2018. The reference lists of the publications and related reviews  were also examined to identify additional studies. A study was eligible if it (i) was a task-related fMRI study, (ii) compared smoking-related cues with neutral cues (all modalities pooled) or involved nonsmoking reward-related cues, (iii) provided peak coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space or Talairach space, and (iv) measured nicotine dependence severity using the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The studies that were included in the present meta-analysis did not necessarily include two groups (only smokers or smokers and healthy controls). The searches identified 33 articles that involved fMRI and smoking cues (two studies reported brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers and comparisons between smokers and healthy controls; 26 studies only reported brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers; five studies only reported comparisons between smokers and healthy controls), resulting in 28 publications that were included in the meta-analysis that examined brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers and seven studies that examined brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls. We also identified 13 publications for nonsmoking reward processing in smokers compared with healthy controls. The detailed process of identifying eligible studies and the reasons for exclusion are presented in Fig.  .   \nFlow chart of the identification of eligible studies. \n  \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nAll coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed using anisotropic effect-size Seed-based d Mapping (SDM, version 5.1.4,  , formerly \u201cSigned Differential Mapping\u201d) . A noteworthy feature of SDM is that it considers studies with positive, negative, and nonsignificant results simultaneously, leading to more precise estimates. It can also provide information about between-study heterogeneity. The software first recreates the study maps of the effect size of differences in BOLD responses between patients and control subjects by converting the   t   value of each peak to Hedges\u2019 effect size and then applies an anisotropic nonnormalized Gaussian kernel so that voxels that are more correlated with the peak have higher effect sizes. Maps are combined with a standard random-effects model, taking into account sample size, intrastudy variability, and between-study heterogeneity. In the SDM Z map, studies with lower variability and a larger sample size made a stronger contribution. Statistical inference was empirically estimated using permutation statistics (i.e., randomization of effect sizes across voxels). Previous studies recommended that 20 permutations lead to stable estimates. In the present study, all of the analyses that are reported were based on 50 permutations . The statistical heterogeneity of individual clusters was examined using a random-effects model. All thresholds were   p  \u2009<\u20090.005, uncorrected with peak height   z  \u2009\u2265\u20091 and cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels. For each significant patient-control comparison, Egger\u2019s test was used to assess the asymmetry of the funnel plot as a measure of potential publication bias . Three different meta-analyses were conducted. First, smoking cue-induced brain activity was compared with the response to neutral cues in smokers. To better understand the influence of nicotine state (abstinent or satiated) on brain reactivity to smoking-related cues, two separate subgroup analyses for abstinent state and satiated state were conducted, and similarities or differences between states were explicitly tested. Second, brain activation in response to smoking-related cues in smokers was then compared with healthy controls. Third, brain activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers was compared with healthy controls. The relationship between the severity of nicotine dependence (FTND scores) and reactivity of reward-related brain regions to smoking-related and nonsmoking reward-related cues was examined using meta-regression. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature search and characteristics of the included studies \n  \nAs shown in Fig.  , a total of 46 papers were retrieved. Twenty-eight of these studies met the inclusion criteria, providing a sample size of 816 smokers (317 female) to investigate brain activity in response to smoking-related cues in smokers. Seven studies reported a comparison between smokers and healthy controls, providing a sample size of 108 smokers (32 female) and 107 healthy controls (37 female). The nonsmoking reward cue processing meta-analysis included 13 studies that evaluated the neural process of reward-related cue exposure, with a sample size of 275 smokers (114 female) and 271 healthy controls (102 female). The specific details of these studies, including demographic information, are shown in Supplementary Table  . \n\n\n### Main meta-analyses of cue-reactivity in smokers \n  \nOur first meta-analysis included the activation coordinates from all 28 studies. This analysis revealed five statistically significant clusters of smoking   minus   neutral activation in smokers (Table  , Fig.  ). The largest cluster was located within the left cingulate gyrus, including the anterior and posterior areas, and most of the significantly active voxels were located within the anterior cingulate gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters were the left angular gyrus and right thalamus. Smaller but theoretically important clusters of activation were detected in and around the right striatum. The increase in activation of the bilateral cingulate gyrus in response to smoking-related cues was consistently reported in smokers. To better address the influence of nicotine state (abstinent or satiated) on brain reactivity to smoking-related cues, a subgroup meta-analysis was also conducted. The two separate analyses of all abstinent-state and satiated-state studies also revealed a consistent increase in activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) and right striatum in response to smoking-related cues in smokers compared with neutral cues (for details, see Supplementary Table   and Table  ).   \nSuprathreshold clusters from activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. \n  \nCoordinates are given for the maximally significant voxel in each area, where   x   defines the lateral placement from the midline (left\u2009=\u2009negative),   y   defines the anteroposterior displacement relative to the anterior commissure (posterior\u2009=\u2009negative) and   z   defines the vertical position relative to the anteroposterior commissural line (down\u2009=\u2009negative). The coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. \n     Brain regions showed significant differences in response to smoking-related cues or nonsmoking reward-related cues based on the meta-analyses.  \n a   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smoking-related cues and neutral cues in smokers.   b   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smokers and healthy controls in response to smoking-related cues.   c   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smokers and healthy controls in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. \n  \n\n\n### Main meta-analysis of comparison of smoking cue-induced brain reactivity between smokers and healthy controls \n  \nAfter combining the activation coordinates from seven studies, four statistically significant clusters of smokers   minus   healthy controls were found (Table  , Fig.  ). Many of these clusters that showed higher activity in smokers were located within the right middle frontal gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters included the orbital frontal gyrus and putamen. The lower activity in smokers (compared with healthy controls) when processing smoking-related cues was located within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n\n\n### Main meta-analysis of comparison of activity in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues between smokers and healthy controls \n  \nThe meta-analysis of nonsmoking reward-related activity included activation coordinates from all 13 studies. Four statistically significant clusters were found (Table  , Fig.  ), three of which showed higher activation in smokers compared with healthy controls and one of which showed lower activity. Most of the clusters that showed higher activation were located within the right inferior parietal gyrus and frontal gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters were located within the insula and inferior prefrontal cortex. Importantly, one large cluster that showed lower activation was located within reward circuitry, specifically the right striatum. \n\n\n### Meta-regression results \n  \nTo examine the effects of the severity of nicotine dependence on reward processing in smokers, meta-regression analyses were performed. The results revealed a significant relationship between FTND scores and activation of the striatum. This indicates that with greater dependence, activation of the striatum in response to reward cues decreased (i.e., both smoking-related cues (Fig.  , Supplementary Table  ) and nonsmoking reward-related cues (Fig.  , Supplementary Table  )). Interestingly, we found a significant positive correlation between the severity of nicotine dependence and reactivation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues, suggesting that greater involvement of the executive control brain regions in response to reward cues is associated with the greater severity of nicotine dependence.    Results of meta-regression in brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers.  \n a   The cluster within the striatum that showed greater activation in response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues and the cluster within the striatum that showed differences in the meta-regression analysis with FTND score as a factor.   b   Forest plot of the mean \u00b1 variance of effect sizes for activation differences in the striatum, estimated from individual studies with smoking-related cue exposure. \n     Results of meta-regression in brain reactivity to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers.  \n a   The cluster within the striatum that showed greater activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls and the cluster within the striatum that showed differences in the meta-regression analysis with FTND score as a factor.   b   Forest plot of the mean \u00b1 variance of effect sizes for group differences in the striatum, estimated from individual studies with nonsmoking reward-related cue exposure. \n  \n\n\n### Sensitivity analyses and publication bias tests \n  \nJackknife sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In our analysis, alterations were replicable in all combinations of studies. Leave-one-out validation indicated that regardless of which study was left out, the meta-analysis consistently identified greater activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in smokers in response to smoking-related cues. All of the combinations consistently reported lower activation of the striatum in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls. The results of the Jackknife sensitivity analyses for the striatum are presented in the   (Supplementary Tables  \u2013 ). \n\nPublication bias is generally the tendency of researchers, journal editors, and corporate entities to manage the reporting of experimental findings that are \u201csignificant\u201d differently from findings that are \u201cnonsignificant.\u201d This then leads to bias in the overall published literature toward only \u201cstatistically significant\u201d effects. Publication bias in the present meta-analyses was tested using Egger\u2019s regression approach. For visual inspection, funnel plots were also generated (Supplementary Figure  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe conducted three meta-analyses of fMRI studies of smoking-related cue exposure and nonsmoking reward-related cue exposure in smokers. Activation of the striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus increased in response to smoking-related cues vs. neutral cues in smokers. The putamen showed greater activation in smokers vs. healthy controls when processing smoking-related cues. The striatum showed lower activation in smokers vs. healthy controls in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. The meta-regression analysis showed that sensitivity of the reward system was disrupted as the severity of nicotine dependence increased, with lower activation of the striatum in response to smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers with higher FTND scores. \n\nIn response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues in smokers, the cingulate gyrus was the most consistently activated. The cingulate gyrus is a critical region of the limbic system. Previous studies have shown that the anterior cingulate gyrus receives projections from structures that process rewards, including the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and mesolimbic dopamine system . Lesions of the anterior cingulate gyrus impaired reward learning and behavioral adjustments that were related to changes in reward . The present study found a robust positive correlation between reactivation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues and the severity of nicotine dependence. The posterior cingulate gyrus is a critical center of the default mode and attentional networks . Neuroimaging studies have shown that it is activated during visual tasks when a monetary incentive is involved, essentially functioning as a neural interface between motivation-related areas and the top-down control of visual attention . Increases in activation of the prefrontal cortex are related to executive control, suggesting that smokers need to exert extra control of smoking urges when exposed to smoking-related cues. The increase in activation of the cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex in response to smoking-related cues in smokers suggests an increase in the distribution of attention to smoking-related cues in smokers. This is consistent with previous studies that found greater attentional bias toward drug-related cues in smokers. For example, smokers maintained their gaze on smoking-related cues for a longer period of time compared with control cues . This result might also be partially explained by incentive sensitization theory, which proposes that repeated associations between drug-related cues and addictive drugs increase the dopaminergic response to these essentially neutral cues, ultimately causing pathological incentive motivation (\u201cwanting\u201d) for these stimuli . \n\nCompared with healthy controls, the activation of reward circuitry significantly increased in response to smoking-related cues and significantly decreased in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers, thus supporting incentive sensitization theory. After repeated associations with smoking, the nonpharmacological neutral stimulus acquires the properties of an incentive reward. Greater activation in the caudate nucleus and cingulate gyrus is consistently found, with the notion that the presence of smoking-related cues increases nicotine/tobacco seeking and hence relapse rates . The striatum and medial prefrontal cortex have been shown to be activated by smoking-related cues, demonstrating the ability of smoking-related stimuli to engage reward-related circuitry. Our meta-analysis showed relatively consistent activation of the prefrontal cortex and striatum, further supporting incentive sensitization theory. \n\nFor nonsmoking reward processing, the significant decrease in activation of the caudate in smokers compared with healthy controls is consistent with reward deficiency syndrome theory. This theory of motivation proposes that addicts have a general deficit in the recruitment of brain reward pathways, resulting in chronic hypoactivation of these circuits in response to both drug- and nondrug-related reward . Previous studies have consistently reported greater activation of the striatum in response to monetary rewards. The striatum has been shown to be involved in reward prediction and the subjective value of rewards . In substance-dependent individuals, the incentive value of nondrug reward is lost, leading to lower activation in the striatum during the processing of monetary and other natural rewards. The decrease in activation of the striatum in response to nondrug rewards has also been observed in opioid addicts , cocaine addicts , and alcohol abusers . However, the finding of lower activation of the striatum in response to nondrug rewards contradicts the recent meta-analysis by Luijten et al. . This discrepancy might be associated with three important differences between these two studies. First, the present study focused on nonsmoking reward-related cues regardless of the type of cue. We pooled monetary and juice cues, whereas the study by Luijten focused only on monetary cues. Second, the present study focused on reward-related cues and reward outcome phases and did not include an anticipatory phase; therefore, the nonsmoking reward-related cues represented the presence of reward outcomes. Third, the present study focused only on nicotine addiction and did not include other addictions. A previous study performed a direct comparison between food cues and smoking cues and found greater activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus in response to smoking cues compared with food cues . The greater engagement of attentional networks and reward-related brain regions during exposure to smoking-related cues is consistent with the present results. \n\nInterestingly, the meta-regression revealed lower activation of the striatum in response to both types of rewards in smokers who had higher FTND scores. This seems to contradict incentive sensitization theory, thus supporting reward deficiency syndrome theory instead. Combining the main results of the meta-analyses and meta-regression, incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory do not appear to conflict with each other when considering the severity of dependence. Nicotine first appears to hijack the reward system and gain incentive value, which is consistent with incentive sensitization theory. As the severity of nicotine dependence increases, sensitivity of the reward system is disrupted, which could be explained by reward deficiency syndrome theory. These two theories could be combined to interpret dissociable activation of the striatum that is observed in smokers. The disruption of reward reactivity to reward-related cues coincides with the development of drug tolerance, meaning that the same dose of nicotine fails to induce the same activation as nicotine dependence develops. Further studies are needed to verify dynamic alterations of the reward system that occur in other kinds of drug dependence and investigate the relationship between reward processing deficits and the severity of drug dependence. \n\nThe present study has several limitations that are inherent to all meta-analyses. First, meta-analyses that are based on peak and effect sizes use data from published studies rather than raw statistical brain maps, thus decreasing accuracy of the results. Second, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution when considering inter-study heterogeneity. Different studies adopted different statistical thresholds and multiple-comparison corrections. \n\nIn conclusion, the reward system appears to be hijacked by the initiation of nicotine dependence, expressed as greater activation of the reward system in response to smoking-related cues and lower activation of the reward system in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. However, activation in response to both types of cues decreased as the severity of nicotine dependence increased, indicating general disruption of sensitivity of the reward system. The present study further reveals the dynamic nature of reward system alterations in smokers and provides new insights into disentangling the divergence between incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory to explain addiction. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 7078287, "text_md5": "9e5ef2c9dc585d6b7e4c7eec5cb34151", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 212], "journal": [213, 230], "publication_year": [232, 236], "title": [247, 345], "keywords": [359, 394], "abstract": [407, 2121], "body": [2130, 27478]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32184386, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-020-0775-0", "pmcid": "7078287", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7078287", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7078287"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7078287\">7078287</a>", "list_title": "PMC7078287  Neural substrates of smoking and reward cue reactivity in smokers: a meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}

However, the location of these altered brain activation patterns after chemotherapy varies considerably across studies. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantitatively synthesise this body of evidence using Activation Likelihood Estimation to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, compared to healthy controls and no chemotherapy controls. Our systematic search identified 12 studies that adopted task-related fMRI on non-central nervous system cancer patients who received chemotherapy relative to controls. All studies were included in the analyses and were grouped into four contrasts. Cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed reduced activation in the left superior parietal lobe/precuneus (family-wise error corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05) compared to no chemotherapy controls. No significant clusters were found in three of our contrasts. The majority of studies did not support an association between altered brain activation and cognitive performance after chemotherapy. Findings point towards a possible chemotherapy-induced alteration, which could inform targeted treatment strategies. With continued work in this field using homogenous task-related protocols and cancer populations, fMRI may be used as a biomarker of cognitive deficits in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCancer is a major cause of death and illness worldwide, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10 million deaths in 2020 (Sung et al.,  ). While chemotherapy has improved cancer survival rates, it is often associated with adverse treatment-related side-effects, including cognitive deficits (Janelsins et al.,  ). Self-reported measures and computerised neuropsychological tests have identified cognitive deficits in cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy regimens, often dubbed \u201cchemobrain\u201d or \u201cchemofog\u201d (for a review, see Hutchinson et al.,  ). The most prominently affected domains in cognitive functioning include impairments in processing speed, memory and executive functions (Ahles et al.,  ; Jansen et al.,  ; Wefel et al.,  ). These symptoms are prevalent across all types of cancer, including those which manifest outside the central nervous system (CNS). Cognitive deficits can have pervasive impacts on cancer survivors\u2019 quality of life, interfering with their capacity to accomplish daily tasks (e.g., cooking and driving), as well as their interpersonal relationships and occupational performance (Boykoff et al.,  ; Henderson et al.,  ; Myers,  ). Therefore, it is important to examine the biological underpinnings of cognitive deficits following chemotherapy to inform treatment strategies. \n\nOver the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded novel insights into the neural substrates of cognitive deficits in cancer patients by investigating aspects of brain function (for a review, see Sousa et al.,  ). Task-related fMRI has been utilised to detect neural abnormalities in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (CTx+) by comparing brain activation patterns during cognitive tasks with healthy controls (HC) and/or cancer patients who received surgery or adjuvant treatments but not chemotherapy (CTx\u2212; no chemotherapy controls). Utilising this MRI technique for the first time, a case study presented in Ferguson et al. ( ) compared monozygotic twins, reporting increased frontal and parietal activation during a working memory task in a twin treated with chemotherapy compared to the healthy twin. Since this initial contribution, several cohort task-related fMRI studies have been undertaken. In one of the first group studies, Kesler et al. ( ) reported both increased activation in multiple brain regions during a memory recall task and decreased activation in the prefrontal cortex during a memory encoding task in CTx+\u2009patients relative to HC. More recent studies have observed similar findings to Ferguson et al. ( ), with increased activation found in frontal regions during working memory and episodic memory tasks in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls (McDonald et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ). Conversely, other studies have shown reduced activation in frontal and parietal regions (Correa et al.,  ; L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) and subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Vardy et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ) in CTx+\u2009patients relative to controls. Despite these notable findings, the localisation and direction of altered brain activation patterns are mixed across studies, rendering interpretation difficult. \n\nAmong popular theories, brain regions of decreased activation in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls, have been interpreted as the result of chemotherapy-induced damage (Correa et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ). Animal studies have demonstrated that non-CNS chemotherapeutic agents can have neurotoxic effects on the structure and function of normal cells in the nervous system (Briones & Woods,  ; Christie et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ). Contrarily, increased brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls, has been suggested as a compensatory mechanism for dysfunction in task-relevant brain regions, with the recruitment of additional brain regions required to reach the same level of performance (Ferguson et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ). With the identification of consistent altered brain activation patterns in CTx+\u2009patients, present understandings may be strengthened. \n\nTo date, a number of scoping and systematic reviews have performed a   qualitative   comparison on brain activation patterns in cancer survivors across several studies, highlighting diffuse alterations in frontal and parietal regions after chemotherapy (Andryszak et al.,  ; de Ruiter & Schagen,  ; Li & Caeyenberghs,  ; Pomykala et al.,  ; Scherling & Smith,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ; Sousa et al.,  ). Aside from these reviews, only one   quantitative   study (Kesler,  ) has been published so far. In this study by Kesler ( ) a meta-analytical technique known as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) was used to synthesise data across six fMRI studies (Conroy, McDonald, Smith, et al.,  ; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ), revealing consistently reduced activation in brain regions involved in the default mode network (e.g., the precuneus and medial frontal gyrus). However, this study was limited by not reporting the group contrasts and methodological procedures used in their ALE analysis. \n\nIn the present study, we will integrate the most-recent fMRI data to identify   robust   patterns across studies, utilising ALE. The ALE approach has successfully been employed to map neural correlates of symptoms in a wide array of neurological and psychiatric populations, including patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (Santangelo et al.,  ), traumatic brain injury (Cook et al.,  ) and major depressive disorders (Zhang et al.,  ). During fMRI, neural locations of peak activation evoked by performance on functional tasks are recorded in stereotaxic coordinates (Fuelscher et al.,  ). An ALE meta-analysis aggregates these significant activation coordinates from multiple neuroimaging studies to identify voxel-wise regions of spatial convergence (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The resulting map incorporates commonly activated neuroanatomical regions across individual studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ). In other words, ALE enables a way of determining how likely a neural location is to be involved in a symptom based on several studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fuelscher et al.,  ). Overall, ALE offers a powerful method for aggregating data from neuroimaging studies as it attempts to minimise study-specific noise of small sample sizes and various experimental tasks (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). An ALE analysis will therefore provide much needed clarification into the potential neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in cancer patients after chemotherapy. \n\n### Aims and hypotheses \n  \nThe aims of the present study are twofold. The primary aim is to conduct an ALE meta-analysis to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients across several task-related fMRI studies. Specifically, we will examine whether there are differences in brain activation patterns during cognitive tasks between non-CNS CTx+\u2009patients, compared to HC and CTx\u2212\u2009patients. It is hypothesised that ALE will reveal consistent alterations in brain activation (i.e., increased activation in frontal and parietal regions and decreased activation in subcortical regions) in CTx+\u2009patients compared to control groups. Our secondary aim is to explore the association between altered brain activation and cognitive performance (i.e., using performance scores from a cognitive task performed as part of the behavioral test battery) in CTx+\u2009patients. This may inform whether regions of altered brain activation patterns are reliable biomarkers of cognitive deficits experienced by cancer survivors. Mixed results have been found in the literature with some studies reporting a positive association (i.e., decreased brain activation associated with worse cognitive task performance; de Ruiter et al.,  ) and other studies revealing no significant association (Correa et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). It is expected that reduced brain activation will be related to diminished performance on cognitive tasks in CTx+\u2009patients. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic search \n  \nA systematic search of peer-reviewed literature published up to 30 July 2020 was conducted. Embase, PsycInfo and MEDLINE Complete databases were searched. The search string involved a combination of keywords including \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201ccancer\u201d, \u201cchemotherapy\u201d and \u201ccognitive dysfunction\u201d, and their synonyms, based on a recent systematic review (Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). See Appendix 1 Table   for the full search syntax. No publication date or language limiters were applied. Reference sections of eligible studies were inspected to identify additional articles of interest. \n\nStudies were included in the analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) utilised task-related fMRI as the main neuroimaging modality; (2) participants performed a cognitive task during scanning; (3) reported coordinates of activation foci in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space; (4) reported group comparisons between cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared with healthy controls and/or no chemotherapy controls. Studies with only restricted regions of interest (ROI) analyses were excluded to ensure that the likelihood of activation was equal across the brain (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Muller et al.,  ). Articles that investigated cancer of the brain or central nervous system (CNS) were also omitted as neurosurgery and CNS-directed chemotherapy are known to induce neurocognitive impairments or brain alterations (Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). Studies conducted in paediatric cancer populations (age\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years) and animal models were removed. Finally, conference abstracts, case studies and systematic reviews were excluded. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nWe extracted and summarised data on clinical population characteristics from each study, including the age and gender of participants, cancer type, time since treatment, chemotherapy regimens and adjuvant treatments (see Appendix 2 Table  ). The steps for neuroimaging analyses of each study are detailed in Table\u00a0 , including group contrasts, sample size, activation foci, brain template, statistical thresholding and fMRI paradigm used. Finally, data was extracted from selected studies which performed correlation analyses between regions of altered brain activation patterns and cognitive performance in the chemotherapy-treated group, including the significance of the relationship, correlation coefficients, and the involved brain regions (Table  ).   \nOverview of the studies included in the ALE analyses \n  \n Note.   CTx+\u2009= cancer patients treated with chemotherapy; CTx\u2212\u2009= no chemotherapy controls; HC\u2009=\u2009healthy controls; < = decreased brain activation; >\u2009=\u2009increased brain activation;   N  \u2009=\u2009sample size; MNI\u2009=\u2009Montreal Neurological Institute; FDR\u2009=\u2009false discovery rate; FWE\u2009=\u2009family-wise error; DLPFC\u2009=\u2009dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; N/A\u2009=\u2009no correlation analyses conducted \n  \n\nThe parameters for an ALE analysis (i.e., sample size and activation foci) were manually imported into text files according to the type of group contrast and the direction of the contrast. Coordinates that were reported in Talairach space were transformed into MNI coordinates using the BioImage Suite tool (Lacadie et al.,  ). In studies that reported foci from two different paradigms (Correa et al.,  ; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), the foci were included as one experiment. However, for the study of Pergolizzi et al. ( ), results were imported as two experiments to account for the different number of participants that completed each paradigm. For longitudinal studies (L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ), data was extracted from the last follow-up time-point. In studies that examined two cohorts of chemotherapy-treated patients, coordinates were selected from the groups of patients who received standard-dose chemotherapy (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) and patients who reported cognitive symptoms (Vardy et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nTo examine the first research question, we conducted four independent ALE analyses using Ginger ALE\u2019s (version 2.3.6;  ) random effects algorithm (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The ALE technique aggregates   statistically significant   foci reported from multiple neuroimaging studies. In other words, contrasts of ALE meta-analyses only include studies that have reported coordinates of brain regions that revealed significant group differences in brain activation (i.e., significant increases or decreases in activation between CTx+\u2009patients and controls). This allows us to identify the brain regions which are most commonly implicated in cognitive symptoms in cancer patients across studies (Acar et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Figure\u00a0  depicts a step-by-step overview of the procedure. Firstly, peak coordinates reported from each neuroimaging study are individually mapped onto a standardised brain. Secondly, to account for spatial uncertainty, Gaussian kernels are applied around the foci, whereby the diameter of the kernel is determined by the study sample size (e.g., smaller studies have more spatial uncertainty and therefore we apply larger kernels; Acar et al.,  ). This process results in a series of modelled activation (MA) maps. Next, an ALE map is computed by calculating the union of these MA maps. In the final step, the ALE map is thresholded by testing the activation likelihood values at each voxel against a null distribution of random spatial associations among studies, to establish at which locations the convergence of foci is greater than can be expected by chance (Eickhoff et al.,  ).   \nOverview of the ALE meta-analysis procedure.   Note.   R\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere; L\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere. Orange, green and yellow colours indicate activation foci obtained from the different studies. Brain surface models were created using the NeuroMarvl tool ( ) \n  \n\nWe corrected for multiple comparisons utilising a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, with 1000 permutations, following an initial cluster-forming threshold of uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. This thresholding procedure provides an appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity and is in line with recommendations from Eickhoff et al. ( ). The resulting maps were overlaid onto a standard anatomical template in MNI space using Mango ( ) to visualise two-dimensional slices and MRIcroGL ( ) to render a three-dimensional image. \n\nIn the first ALE, we tested for decreased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to healthy controls (CTx+\u2009< HC). The second ALE examined increased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy relative to healthy controls (CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC). The third ALE tested for decreased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls (CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2212). In the fourth ALE, we looked for increased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls (CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212). Finally, for contrasts that reported no significant clusters, we conducted an exploratory analysis, using an uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and minimum cluster sizes of 50mm . \n\n\n### Behavioral metrics \n  \nTo investigate the second research question, correlation analyses from each study were reviewed to observe overall data trends. Next, we calculated effect sizes for main findings where information was available (i.e.,   R  \u2009=\u2009squared correlation coefficient). Following Cohen\u2019s ( ) conventions, .01 was regarded as a weak relationship, .09 a moderate relationship, and .25 a strong relationship. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nThe search of databases identified a total of 446 studies, of which 21 were assessed for eligibility at full text (see Fig.\u00a0  for the PRISMA flow diagram). We excluded four studies, which conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis (executive control subnetwork; Askren et al.,  ; Hosseini & Kesler,  ; Jung et al.,  ; multitasking subnetwork; Deprez et al.,  ). We also omitted one case study (Ferguson et al.,  ), one resting-state fMRI study (Apple et al.,  ) and one study that used a facial expression fMRI task (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). Moreover, one study was removed as we were unable to verify the brain template (Kam et al.,  ). Another study was excluded as the peak coordinates were not reported (Conroy, McDonald, Ahles, et al.,  ). This resulted in a final set of 12 task-related fMRI studies published between 2009 and 2019, included in the current study. Of these 12 studies, eight reported significant results for the CTx+\u2009< HC contrast (21 foci), three for the CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC contrast (12 foci), four for the CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (26 foci) and three for the CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (13 foci; as can be seen in Fig.  ).   \nPRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process, adapted from Moher et al.

Cancer populations investigated included breast (10, 83%), ovarian (1, 8%) and colorectal, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, leukaemia and melanoma (1, 8%) cancers. The selected studies involved cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (  N  \u2009=\u2009240), healthy controls (  N  \u2009=\u2009103) and no chemotherapy controls (  N  \u2009=\u2009134), with an average age of 53.72\u00a0years (  SD  \u2009=\u20097.7). Two studies used both a healthy control group and no chemotherapy control group. Four studies used a no chemotherapy control group and six studies used only a healthy control group. Of note, no chemotherapy controls encompassed cancer patients who had undergone surgery and, in some cases, had also received endocrine and/or radiation therapy as part of their cancer treatment (see Appendix 2). Most cancer patients were treated with standard-dose chemotherapy regimens, which included a combination of chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, docetaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and thiotepa. The time between completion of chemotherapy treatment and fMRI scan, spanned one month to 13\u00a0years. Various fMRI paradigms were utilised to evaluate brain activation including a wide array of working memory, executive function, episodic or verbal memory and attention tasks. Full clinical population characteristics and neuroimaging details are summarised in Appendix 2 Table\u00a0 \u00a0and Table  , respectively. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analyses \n  \n#### Alterations in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to healthy controls. \n  \nNo significant clusters were found between CTx+\u2009patients and HC, using an exploratory uncorrected threshold (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). \n\n\n#### Alterations in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls \n  \nAs can be seen in Fig.\u00a0 , CTx+\u2009patients showed a pattern of decreased brain activation in the left superior parietal lobe/precuneus (Brodmann area 7) compared to CTx\u2212\u2009patients (FWE corrected). Table\u00a0  provides the MNI coordinates of significant functional brain activation. No significant results were found in the opposite direction (CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212) using an uncorrected threshold.   \nMeta-analytical maps of decreased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls.

Five of these seven studies (71%) reported a non-significant association between functional brain alterations and cognitive performance. Only two of these seven studies revealed a statistically-significant association (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). Specifically, reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions were related to a decline in cognitive performance on executive function (  R  \u2009=\u200959%) and episodic memory (  R  \u2009=\u200962%) tasks, respectively (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). These effect sizes were calculated from de Ruiter et al. ( ) only, as limited information was provided in Stouten-Kemperman et al. ( ). Following Cohen\u2019s ( ) conventions, these associations can be regarded as strong relationships. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study set out to map the common regions of altered brain activation patterns in non-CNS cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapy. By combining coordinates of peak activation from 240 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (CTx+), 103 healthy controls (HC) and 134 no chemotherapy controls (CTx\u2212), the present ALE meta-analysis is one of the first studies to quantitatively summarise the existing fMRI data. Our findings revealed decreased activation in the left precuneus located in the superior parietal lobe in CTx+\u2009patients. No significant clusters were detected in three of our contrasts (i.e., CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212, CTx+\u2009< HC and CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC). Furthermore, our results showed that the majority of studies did not provide evidence to suggest that altered brain activation following chemotherapy is related to performance on cognitive tasks. To this end, we will discuss a few methodological considerations for future task-related fMRI studies. \n\n### The role of the precuneus in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy \n  \nCancer patients who received chemotherapy showed reduced activation in the left precuneus, a region thought to play a pivotal role in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including episodic memory retrieval, visuospatial imagery and self-referential processing (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). This data aligns with results from a previous ALE analysis by Kesler ( ), which revealed decreased activation in the precuneus of CTx+\u2009patients. Findings are also consistent with a number of studies utilising resting-state fMRI (Chen et al.,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ), where decreased functional connectivity was observed in the left precuneus in CTx+\u2009patients compared to healthy controls. However, our finding suggests that the alteration in the left precuneus may be a chemotherapy-specific effect. This is supported by the fact that our finding was identified in the contrast with cancer patients who had not received chemotherapy as a control group, hence accounting for variables that may arise from a cancer diagnosis (e.g., anxiety and depression) and surgery (e.g., post-operative dysfunction and inflammation; Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). Cancer patients from the two studies, which reported coordinates of significant reduction in brain activation within the precuneus (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), were treated with a combination of fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapeutic drugs. Although we cannot disentangle the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this potential brain alteration, these agents have been found in animal models to permeate the blood-brain-barrier and attack neurons in the CNS through mechanisms involving increased oxidative stress, demyelination and mitochondria disruption (for a review see Lv et al.,  ). \n\nThe precuneus may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, given its high metabolic demands. The precuneus is a vastly connected hub that is part of a broader subnetwork (i.e., the default mode network; Utevsky et al.,  ). Due to its widespread connections with associated cortical and subcortical regions, the precuneus is considered functionally valuable for integrative processes (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). Recent studies leveraging functional connectomes have also found that hub regions have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections compared to other brain regions, and could therefore be considered biologically costly (Crossley et al.,  ; Gollo et al.,  ). This high metabolic cost has been revealed in a wide array of clinical populations (Klaassens et al.,  ; Raizman et al.,  ), implicating the precuneus as a region that is often vulnerable to disease and ageing processes. Due to its high metabolic demand, it is possible that the precuneus receives more exposure to chemotherapy neurotoxicity, increasing susceptibility to direct damage and/or indirect disruptions to metabolic resources (Kesler & Blayney,  ; Mounier et al.,  ). Further, chemotherapy mechanisms may exacerbate physiological cascades that are already impacted by ageing and disease, especially given the sample from our significant result were older cancer survivors (age\u2009>\u200956\u00a0years). With these considerations in mind, we provide novel evidence of chemotherapy-induced alterations in the left precuneus which may contribute to cognitive deficits in cancer patients. \n\nInterestingly we did not find other brain regions of significant convergence across the 12 included studies. In particular, the lack of significant findings for the increased contrasts (CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC; CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2013) was against expectations. At closer inspection, only 25 foci of significant increases in brain activation in CTx+\u2009compared to controls (across 5 individual studies) in our ALE meta-analysis could be identified. The low number of foci can partially explain the non-significant findings of our meta-analysis. Similarly, our ALE meta-analysis did not reveal significant findings for the CTx+\u2009< HC contrast, possibly due to the low number of areas of significant decreases in CTx\u2009+\u2009patients compared to healthy controls (21 foci, across 8 individual studies). The ALE method combines significant activation coordinates across multiple studies to uncover which brain regions are most frequently implicated in the literature (Eickhoff et al.,  : Eickhoff et al.,  ). Moreover, the non-significant findings suggest that the brain regions, which revealed differences in activation in the individual studies, stem from widespread brain regions and therefore the meta-analysis cannot detect significant regions of convergence. \n\nIn addition, heterogeneity in the samples across the included studies may have hindered convergence in our meta-analysis (Muller et al.,  ). It has been suggested that functional brain alterations may follow a pattern which progresses over time, with increased compensatory brain activation occurring shortly after chemotherapy cessation and normalising over time, and decreased brain activation persisting over time (Koppelmans et al.,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ; Sousa et al.,  ). For example, the time between completing chemotherapy and fMRI scan varied considerably among studies. Five studies examined the acute effects of chemotherapy (i.e., < six months post-treatment) of which nearly half found increased cortical activation in CTx+\u2009patients (2 studies, 40%; Kesler et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ). Our finding of reduced activation in the precuneus in cancer patients who received chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls was sourced from two studies (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), which tested cancer survivors in the chronic stage (i.e., > 10\u00a0years post-treatment). We suggest that increased brain activation in cortical regions could not be observed due to the combined acute and chronic effects of chemotherapy examined. To this end, convergence of activation in the precuneus in the CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2013 contrast may have been found due to a number of communalities across the two studies (from the same research institutes) reporting this finding, including the use of similar inclusion/exclusion selection criteria for cancer patients (e.g., the type of chemotherapeutic agent), the fMRI task (i.e., episodic memory) and scanning protocols (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Correlation between functional brain alterations and cognition \n  \nA review of the fMRI literature demonstrated that the majority of previous studies (5/7) did not find an association between altered brain activation patterns and cognitive performance in CTx+\u2009patients. Only two of these studies reported a significant relationship and only one study (de Ruiter et al.,  ) provided sufficient information to compute an effect size. Specifically, we found a strong correlation between altered brain activation and cognitive functioning, such that increased pathology predicts poorer performance on cognitive tasks (i.e., executive function and episodic memory) following chemotherapy. Despite the limited evidence, several functional neuroimaging studies have characterised brain function profiles as \u2018biomarkers\u2019 of cognitive functioning (e.g., Kesler et al.,  ). We suggest that these interpretations may be premature and future research examining the relationship between brain-based measures and detailed cognitive assessments is warranted. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThere are three notable limitations that impact interpretation of the current results. First is the relatively small number of task-related fMRI studies that have been published. The cluster of reduced activation in the precuneus was found from two of four studies in the CTx+\u2009<\u2009CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (Table  ). Considering Eickhoff et al. ( ) recommends around 17\u201320 studies in each dataset to obtain robust results, our ALE analyses may not hold sufficient power to detect small effects, partial out subject-specific variation and ensure that results are not led by single experiments (Muller et al.,  ). Nonetheless, our meta-analysis has combined the most fMRI data on this topic to date. To consolidate findings and clarify other neural abnormalities in CTx+\u2009patients, additional task-related fMRI studies need to be conducted to run a comprehensive meta-analysis on the same topic with a larger sample (e.g., 20 studies) in the future. \n\nThe second limitation of the present study is the variation in clinical sample characteristics across the selected fMRI studies (as can be seen in Appendix 2). First, the mix of chemotherapeutic drug combinations may have resulted in fewer robust patterns. Animal models have shown that some agents are more neurotoxic than others (Christie et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ). For example, studies included a combination of blood-brain-barrier permeable (e.g., methotrexate, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide) and impermeable chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin), which can induce mixed effects on the CNS (Carozzi et al.,  ). Second, as raised above, the variability in post-chemotherapy time intervals may facilitate divergent brain activation patterns. With the studies ranging from over one-month (Pergolizzi et al.,  ) to 13\u00a0years (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) after chemotherapy, it is possible that a mixture of transient compensatory mechanisms and long-term reduced brain alterations are present within this literature. The current number of available studies is too small to separate data according to the abovementioned variables. As the field progresses and more studies are published, we can pool data based on these clinical subgroups and consequently, discover further patterns of altered brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients. \n\nThe third limitation of our study is that analyses may be hampered by inconsistencies across the methodological features of the included studies (as can be seen in Table  ). First, the fMRI tasks utilised varied across studies; they comprised an assortment of executive function (i.e., Tower of London), memory (i.e., paired associates learning and levels of processing) and attention (i.e., n-back) tasks. This is a relevant issue, as tasks belonging to different neuropsychological domains activate different brain regions (Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ). Future research would benefit from employing fMRI tasks from the Human Connectome Project dataset (Barch et al.,  ), which have been well-validated and demonstrate reliable activation in function-specific regions, producing data amenable to concatenation. Second, the results of ALE meta-analyses are guided by statistically significant regions identified in previous studies in the form of stereotaxic coordinates (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The probability of the activity of a voxel or cluster differing between groups is largely affected by the choice of statistical threshold applied. In our meta-analysis, 58% of studies employed low uncorrected thresholds. Studies using less stringent statistical thresholds are more likely to report findings that are significant than studies with stricter thresholds (Acar et al.,  ). This undoubtedly explains some of the variability observed in the literature on functional brain alterations in cancer patients. While ALE is able to remove some between-study variability (i.e., sample size), the fact that the analysis exclusively combines data for statistically significant sites only, suggests it may introduce bias (Acar et al.,  ). Future researchers should take this bias into account by applying cluster-level family-wise error correction (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), as this thresholding procedure has low susceptibility to false positives (Muller et al.,  ). \n\nDespite these limitations, patterns of abnormal brain activation are emerging from task-related fMRI findings on cancer survivors. A strength of the current study lies in the ALE approach used to collate data across diverse neuroimaging studies to clarify known inconsistencies (Sousa et al.,  ). We also performed the most up-to-date literature search of task-related fMRI data on cognitive deficits in cancer patients. For example, compared to a previous ALE analysis (Kesler,  ), we included six additional studies that were not previously incorporated (Correa et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ; Vardy et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present ALE meta-analysis is one of the first to combine a series of recent task-related fMRI studies to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation patterns in CTx+\u2009patients. After accounting for cancer-related variables, we found a pattern of reduced activation in the left precuneus of CTx+\u2009patients. Our results provide insight into a possible chemotherapy-induced alteration in cancer survivors, potentially guiding targeted treatment strategies. Further studies are needed to perform a larger-scale meta-analysis using harmonised task-related fMRI protocols, evaluating the effects of chemotherapeutic agents and post-chemotherapy time intervals on brain activation patterns. With continued investigation, fMRI may be considered a useful biomarker of cognitive deficits in the future. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 9581855, "text_md5": "262f8727bdc1d8e3b44584d617444df8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 92], "journal": [93, 112], "publication_year": [114, 118], "title": [129, 273], "keywords": [287, 374], "abstract": [387, 1885], "body": [1894, 38446]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35366180, "doi": "10.1007/s11682-022-00655-4", "pmcid": "9581855", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9581855", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9581855"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9581855\">9581855</a>", "list_title": "PMC9581855  Mapping cognitive deficits in cancer patients after chemotherapy: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of task-related fMRI studies"}

Functional imaging studies investigating those functions in MS patients are hard to compare, as they include heterogeneous patient groups and use different paradigms for cognitive testing. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in neuronal activation between MS patients and healthy controls performing attention and working memory tasks. Two meta-analyses of previously published fMRI studies investigating attention and working memory were conducted for MS patients and healthy controls, respectively. Resulting maps were contrasted to compare brain activation in patients and healthy controls. Significantly increased brain activation in the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was detected for healthy controls. In contrast, higher neuronal activation in MS patients was obtained in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right premotor area. With this meta-analytic approach previous results of investigations examining cognitive function using fMRI are summarized and compared. Therefore a more general view on cognitive dysfunction in this heterogeneous disease is enabled. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized predominantly by demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the brain and the spinal cord. Conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to identify and quantify these lesions. Furthermore, focal demyelination and neuronal loss of gray matter, appearing as partly or entirely cortically located lesions on MRI images as well as structural damage of white and gray matter appearing normal on conventional MRI images are components of the disease ( ). A hallmark of CNS lesions characteristic for MS is disseminations in both space and time. Due to spatially disseminated damage to the CNS, MS results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from motor symptoms to cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits. Disease onset peaks between 22 and 30 years and women are affected approximately twice as often as men ( ). \n\nThe different clinical courses of MS can be categorized into four types based on disease progression ( ): Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) which is characterized by clearly defined relapses with full recovery or sequelae and residual defects. During periods between relapses the disease does not progress clinically. In case this phenotype of the disease is followed by a progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus it is classified as secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In contrast, primary progressive MS (PPMS) takes a progressive course from the beginning with plateaus and temporary minor improvements. The fourth type is progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS), which is progressive from the onset with acute relapses. Between the relapses there is continuing progression. Superimposed relapses may occur in SPMS, whereas in PPMS no acute relapses occur (patients with relapses are then categorized as having PRMS;  ). \n\nAmong the clinical symptoms which affect all types of MS cognitive impairment is the most common symptom with prevalence rates between 43% and 70% significantly contributing to the extent of disability ( ). Memory, attention, processing speed, information processing efficiency, and executive functioning have been shown to be the cognitive capacities that are most frequently impaired ( ). \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) has been used to identify brain regions that are on the one hand involved in cognitive functioning in healthy individuals and on the other hand showing altered activation in MS. FMRI studies that explored cognitive processes in MS examined a great variety of functions, such as working memory, attention, and executive functions ( ) using paradigms such as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; e.g.  ), the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test (PVSAT;  ), and the n-Back task (e.g.  ). These abilities were not only examined in behavioral studies, but also using functional imaging to explore the neuronal correlates of impaired performance. \n\nDuring the last years, the number of functional imaging studies rapidly increased as the neuroscience community urged to gain more detailed insight into diseases progression and prognosis, as well as therapeutic options. However, results of these studies are hardly comparable, as typically stimulation paradigms, disease phenotypes, and statistical evaluation of fMRI data show huge variability. Therefore, the current study aimed at providing an overview of previous literature in conjunction with the mapping of functional brain activity related to attention and working memory function in MS patients with high statistical probability performing meta-analyses in order to present a comparison of neuronal activity patterns of MS patients with those of healthy controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nFor this meta-analysis peer-reviewed studies on functional neuroimaging of attention and working memory processes in patients with multiple sclerosis, published in the English language between 1996 and February 2013 were identified. \n\nLiterature research was performed using PubMed, an online database including more than 22 million citations for biomedical literature using the following keywords:   functional MRI  ;   positron emission tomography  ;   multiple sclerosis   (including common abbreviations like   fMRI  ,   PET  , and   MS  ); which were cross-referenced with the search terms   cognition  ;   information processing speed  ;   memory  ;   working memory  ;   executive functions  ;   selective; focused or sustained attention  ; and   attention  . In addition, we used search terms for tasks associated with working memory and attention like n-Back;   Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test  ; and   Paced Visual Serial Addition Test   (including the common acronyms PASAT and PVSAT) as cross-reference. In a second step, the reference lists of the original articles resulting from this search were examined in order to find additional publications that were not identified by the database search. \n\nFor the current meta-analysis the following seven inclusion criteria were specified:   \nStudies must include patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis, studies including patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) with the diagnosis \u201cpossible MS\u201d were excluded. \n  \nIncluded studies had to focus on attention and working memory processes by using auditory or visually presented stimuli. Studies, that used cognitive paradigms investigating attention in conjunction with higher cognitive abilities, such as response inhibition, were excluded. \n  \nThe studies had to examine neuronal activity in working memory and/or attention tasks with means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). \n  \nAs contrasts used for fMRI or PET analysis we only included direct comparisons between attention or working memory task against a baseline condition for MS patients and healthy controls separately. Comparisons between healthy controls and MS patients without reporting brain activation for each group separately were not included. \n  \nOnly studies reporting coordinates of a whole-brain analysis for patients and healthy controls separately were included. Studies reporting only results of regions of interest (ROI) analyses, volume of interest (VOI) analyses, or small volume correction (SVC) were excluded. Also, studies that reported only correlations of BOLD signal changes with respect to other measures were excluded. \n  \nAll reported results had to be corrected for multiple testing at a significance level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, uncorrected data had to be thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005. \n  \nIncluded coordinates had to be reported in either standard Talairach space or the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses ( ), were performed using GingerALE 2.1 ( ). If necessary, neuroanatomical coordinates reported in MNI space were transformed to Talairach space ( ) using icbm2tal transformation ( ) implemented in GingerALE. \n\nThe ALE technique uses peak coordinates reported in functional neuroimaging studies as Gaussian probability distributions. The ALE algorithm is based on random-effects interference and controls for sample size by including the number of subjects in each study into calculation ( ). First, a whole-brain ALE map is created by estimating the likelihood of activation of each voxel. In the next step, the calculated ALE values are tested against the null hypothesis by using permutation testing ( ). The resulting statistical maps are thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 and corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). In the last step, GingerALE performs a cluster analysis based on the thresholded map with a minimum cluster size of 200\u00a0mm . Separate meta-analyses were performed for patients and healthy controls. Finally, the resulting ALE maps for each group were subtracted from each other. Individual ALE maps were thresholded at a conservative level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FDR corrected), therefore a voxel-level threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 (uncorrected) was used for subtraction analyses to avoid inflating false negative results. To control for inordinate influence of one single study, further meta-analyses were performed, using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. \n\nFor visualization, whole-brain maps of thresholded ALE maps were imported into Multi-image analysis GUI (MANGO;  ) and overlaid onto a standardized anatomical template in Talairach space (colin1.1.nii;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature review \n  \nBased on the systematic review of literature, a total of 42 articles that explored working memory and/or attention networks in MS using either fMRI or PET were identified. However, only nine studies in total, all using fMRI, fulfilled all inclusion criteria specified in the method section (see  ). These studies provided a total of 158 foci for healthy controls and 201 foci for patients with multiple sclerosis. Six of the included studies used correction for multiple testing at the peak- or cluster-level. The remaining three papers reported uncorrected   p  -value thresholds, the least conservative threshold was   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected (one study). \n\nFor visualization of homogeneity of the included studies, all reported foci were presented in Talairach space for healthy controls and MS patients separately ( A and B). \n\n\n### Significant ALE values for working memory and attention in healthy controls \n  \nThe ALE analysis of healthy subjects revealed 17 significant clusters for working memory and attention tasks (  and  ). We found significant ALE scores bilaterally in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, VLPFC). ALE analysis further revealed significant clusters in the frontal eye field and the inferior parietal lobule, two areas responsible for visual attention. Moreover, significant ALE values were obtained in the insular cortex and in the thalamus. \n\n\n### Significant ALE values for working memory and attention in MS patients \n  \nFor MS patients, ALE analysis obtained 24 statistically significant clusters related to working memory and attention tasks (  and  ). Similar to healthy controls, large significant clusters were found in the DLPFC and VLPFC, and in the inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, ALE analysis revealed significant clusters in the superior and middle temporal gyri and in the insular cortex. \n\n\n### Comparison of ALE maps for healthy controls and MS patients \n  \nTo investigate differences between MS patients and healthy controls, we calculated contrasts for the ALE maps of healthy controls versus MS patients and MS patients versus healthy controls. Significant ALE values related to higher likelihood of activation in healthy controls were found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule and the DLPFC as well as in the right VLPFC (  and  ). For the reverse contrast, indicating increased likelihood of activation in MS patients clusters were obtained in the left VLPFC and the right premotor area (  and  ). \n\n\n### Testing of robustness of ALE maps \n  \nDue to the small number of included studies, one single study may influence resulting ALE maps excessively. Therefore, we performed nine additional meta-analyses, removing one single study from the data set. The results of this cross-validation procedure revealed high consistency of significant ALE maps (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this review was to explore differences in brain activation between MS patients and healthy controls induced by working memory and attention tasks using the statistical power of a meta-analytic approach. Results of the ALE meta-analysis revealed the highest likelihood for activation in main attention and working memory related brain areas, such as the DLPFC and VLPFC and the inferior parietal lobule in healthy controls and MS patients. However, we found significantly increased activation bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule and the DLPFC as well as the right VLPFC for healthy controls. In contrast, MS patients showed higher activation in the left VLPFC and the right premotor area. \n\nDomains, typically impaired in MS patients are working memory, information processing speed and executive functions, including attention (for review see  ). Additionally, the neuropsychological assessment of these abilities can easily be implemented in an fMRI setup so that we decided to only include fMRI studies investigating attention and working memory in this ALE meta-analysis. The included studies in MS patients involved fMRI paradigms such as the PASAT and the PVSAT, comprising working memory as well as attention abilities ( ). Although working memory and attention are distinguishable constructs, both processes are highly interactive ( ). It is assumed that attention procedures actively participate in the manipulation and updating of working memory contents (for review see  ). In different subtypes of MS especially PASAT served to detect and observe impairment of working memory and attention which have been identified among other cognitive deficits even at early stages of the disease ( ). With large batteries of neuropsychological tests differences between cognitive impairment in PPMS and RRMS have been presented. Impaired information processing speed, attention, working memory, executive function, and verbal episodic memory have been identified in PPMS whereas in RRMS only information processing speed and working memory were impaired in comparison to healthy controls ( ). Restricted performance in working memory and attention related tasks has been indicated to be significantly associated with lesion load on structural MR images of the brain ( ). \n\nBesides task-based functional imaging studies, patients with MS have increasingly been inspected using resting-state connectivity measures. Recently, systematic alterations of functional connectivity in resting-state networks have been identified in patients with MS. Characteristic modifications of functional connectivity at rest have been identified for the default mode network ( ), as well as for the sensorimotor network ( ), claiming changes already in very early stages of the disease ( ). Specific alterations of functional networks in patients with MS have been hypothesized to serve as an imaging biomarker for different cognitive functions, such as working memory ( ) or attention ( ). \n\nIn this meta-analysis 17 significant ALE clusters were obtained for healthy controls. In contrast, the ALE analysis for MS patients revealed 24 significant clusters. The increased number of ALE clusters among MS patients might be explained by overreaching compensatory mechanisms, which have also been found for cognitive impairments in various diseases, such as major depression ( ) or Alzheimer's disease ( ). The results of this ALE meta-analysis revealed an increased likelihood of activation in the left VLPFC inducing an increased activation of the ventral attention network (VAN) compared to healthy controls, which showed more activation in the dorsal attention network (DAN). Findings of previous studies further point out the involvement of two different neural networks ( ) in attention processes, which cover different components of attention ( ). The dorsal pathway is activated by expectation and anticipation, whereby top-down signals are transmitted to the sensory cortex ( ). In contrast, the ventral system is not pre-activated by expectation but plays an important role in reorienting attention based on new information ( ), reflecting a stimulus-driven bottom-up process (for review see  ). Although both systems cover different aspects of attention, these networks interact in a systematic way ( ). It is assumed that the interaction between the dorsal and the ventral system contributes to some sort of reorienting attention (for review see  ). One reason for poorer performance of MS patients in the PASAT task may be a lack of preparatory expectation, reflected by an increased activation of the VAN in MS patients compared to healthy controls. Expectations based on pre-existing information contribute to simplification of decision by excluding unlikely events ( ). In MS patients, the DAN is less pre-activated by expectation, which may contribute to poorer performance in attention and working memory tasks. \n\nPrevious functional imaging studies revealed right hemisphere lateralization of the ventral pathway in healthy adults ( ). The results of the meta-analysis presented an increased likelihood of activation in the left VLPFC in the MS patient group compared to healthy controls, in which typical right hemisphere dominance was obtained. Atypical brain lateralization of cognitive functions has been detected in several neurological and psychiatric diseases such as autism ( ), schizophrenia ( ), or dyslexia ( ; for review see  ). It has been revealed that also anatomical differences in the human brain may indicate significant functional changes already in the fetus ( ). Atypical lateralization of cognitive function may therefore potentially predict disease progression already in early stages. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough meta-analyses present a powerful method to calculate the statistical overlap between individual functional imaging studies, all data reducing approaches suffer from inherent drawbacks. The ALE technique, as all other meta-analysis techniques, is unable to assess subtle methodological differences in individual studies, or differences in preprocessing steps. However, it can be assumed that these potential errors do not systematically influence the results of a meta-analysis. In addition, sample size and number of reported foci are included into ALE algorithm ( ), therefore no individual study is able to bias the ALE analysis significantly ( ). It should be recognized that meta-analyses are based upon previously published studies. However, studies without significant results or findings contradictory to the dominating opinion in a specific field of science may never be prepared for publication, what may cause a systematic overestimation of the results. MS patients usually show heterogeneous clinically symptoms, therefore, we defined strict inclusion criteria to create a data set, as homogeneous as possible. As a result, only nine studies fulfilled all criteria. Although the ALE algorithm controls for sample size of single studies and number of reported foci, calculations on a relatively small data set may result in increased influence of one single study on the results of the meta-analysis. Therefore, we monitored the impact of each study using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, in which no dominance of one single study was evident. \n\nMultiple sclerosis is a complex and multi-layered disease with various disease specific influencing factors, such as age, disease type, and duration or type of medication, resulting in very inhomogeneous patient groups. Especially the age and the disease duration are correlated with the type of disease, as the SPMS type requires a longer duration until the onset of disease until it can be diagnosed. Therefore, generalized conclusions regarding disease progression based on findings of functional imaging studies are difficult. It has been shown that different aspects of cognition are impaired in different subtypes of MS ( ). Combining the results of studies including different phenotypes of MS is necessary in order to be able to analyze data cumulatively. FMRI data acquired in RRMS, RPMS, and SPMS were combined in the original studies as well as in our meta-analysis at the cost of sensitivity to differences in activation between these phenotypes. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nIn multiple sclerosis the exact diagnosis, especially in early stages of the disease is challenging. Therefore the acquisition and combination of different indicators, such as lesion load, functional and structural information is of huge importance. However, in MS patient groups are typically inhomogeneous with respect to age, disease duration, or type of disease, therefore the development of new functional or structural biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression is complicated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize previous results of working memory and attention abilities in patients with MS to enable a general view on cognitive dysfunction in this disease. To gain more detailed insight into differences between disease subtypes concerning cognitive impairment and cognition related brain activation, studies including large patient groups of different subtypes are required. Furthermore, the resulting ALE maps will be provided online ( ), and can be used as masks for further ROI analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest in relation to this manuscript. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 3878376, "text_md5": "47c578895a4a0715781087595f7091fe", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 93], "journal": [94, 115], "publication_year": [117, 121], "title": [132, 270], "keywords": [284, 406], "abstract": [419, 1990], "body": [1999, 22981]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 24056084, "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.09.005", "pmcid": "3878376", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878376", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3878376"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878376\">3878376</a>", "list_title": "PMC3878376  Altered likelihood of brain activation in attention and working memory networks in patients with multiple sclerosis: An ALE meta-analysis\u2606"}

We performed a whole-brain meta-analysis based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to elucidate the neurobiological basis underlying reward anticipation between CHR individuals and healthy controls. In our meta-analysis, we found that CHR individuals showed increased anticipation-related activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex as well as decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuit, including the putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, cerebellum, and supramarginal gyrus. These results provide further support for the aberrant salience hypothesis in at-risk populations, help us understand the neurobiology of the high risk of psychotic disorder, and could have implications for early identification and early intervention. \n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is a developmental disorder that begins with a prodromal period of altered functioning or symptomatology before the onset of threshold psychosis ( ). It has been recognized that the behavioral and neuropsychological manifestations in the early phases of SZ are different from those of late symptoms and chronic illness stage ( ), thus highlighting the importance of exploring the neural correlates of reward processing in the prodromal phase ( ). Moreover, the recruitment and evaluation of individuals at clinical high risk for SZ (CHR) could overcome confounding factors that are encountered when studying patients with SZ, such as antipsychotic medications and illness duration ( ). It is therefore important to investigate the psychopathological mechanisms among CHR individuals that could highlight early vulnerability factors. \n\n\u201cClinical high risk\u201d individuals have been defined as individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, or a recent decline in functioning ( ;  ). These prodromal syndromes can generally be assessed by several structured instruments [e.g., the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes ( ) and the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States ( )]. However, detecting psychosis risk solely based on the symptom characteristics of CHR individuals yields low efficiency. For example, relying on subtle symptoms in a CHR group led to a correct 24-month disease prediction in only 29% ( ). Fortunately, there are early neurobiological abnormalities apparent long before behavioral and subclinical symptoms emerge, such as abnormal laminar cortical organization, genetic alterations, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) abnormalities ( ;  ). A recent study used a support vector machine approach to analyze structural and fMRI data and effectively identified CHR individuals with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 76%, resulting in an accuracy of 72% ( ). Therefore, it is essential to examine potential neurobiological markers in CHR individuals that can shed light on early altered neural processes prior to significant psychopathologies, as found in patients with psychiatric disorders. \n\nImpaired anticipation of future rewards might play an important role in understanding psychotic symptoms in CHR individuals. Studies measuring monetarily incentivized responses have found that CHR individuals are more likely to attend to irrelevant stimulus features, which is interpreted as an aberrant motivational salience attribution ( ). It is hypothesized that chaotic firing of dopaminergic neurons projecting to limbic and cortical areas mediates the inadequate attribution of salience to irrelevant events, which in turn results in positive symptoms ( ). Wotruba and colleagues reported a significant correlation between positive symptoms and the anticipation signal in the ventral striatum (VS) and the insula in CHR individuals ( ). In addition, negative symptoms are thought to be associated with the transition to psychosis ( ). In a study that examined reward processing among the CHR population, individuals with greater negative symptoms showed greater BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ). These studies provide some evidence that the CHR state may be associated with alterations in reward anticipation. Therefore, studying reward anticipation in the at-risk period may help us understand aberrant salience in CHR individuals. \n\nAlthough previous studies have identified several likely neural substrates for monetary anticipation in CHR individuals to date, the results are inconclusive. Several fMRI experiments have demonstrated abnormal brain activity in mesocorticolimbic circuitry during anticipation of reward-capturing \u201cmotivational salience\u201d in the CHR population ( ;  ). Alterations in motivational salience processing in the VS and cortical regions (such as the prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex) have been described in prepsychotic individuals ( ;  ). However, findings from these studies have been relatively mixed. Some studies have found that CHR individuals exhibit greater activations in the cingulate cortex ( ;  ), insula ( ), and superior frontal gyrus ( ). In contrast, other studies have reported that CHR individuals show deactivations in the posterior cingulate cortex and postcentral gyrus ( ) during anticipation. Such inconsistencies may be due to multiple factors, including the heterogeneity of the employed reward paradigm, the difference in clinical features, and the data processing strategy. \n\nConsequently, a recent meta-analysis attempted to address the question of the neural bases of reward signaling in SZ from the perspective of distinct stages of reward processing ( ). However, the sample of this meta-analysis included both CHR and SZ, resulting in unclear neurobiological mechanisms underlying CHR. In addition, this meta-analysis focused only on the VS instead of the whole brain. To map the potentially distinctive neural profiles associated with CHR and identify whether anticipation-related dysfunction predates the onset of SZ, it is necessary to investigate the biological mechanisms underpinning CHR during reward anticipation. \n\nTherefore, to address these doubts and inconsistencies and to improve current knowledge of reward impairments in CHR individuals, the current meta-analysis systematically synthesized the available evidence regarding whole-brain neural correlates of reward anticipation in CHR individuals and identified potential neuroimaging markers of SZ prodrome. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task ( ) and salience attribution test (SAT) ( ) are operant conditioning paradigms to study reward anticipation in which participants learn to respond to a discriminative stimulus by pushing a button, thereby creating a distinct state of reward anticipation ( ). We further examined the influence of demographic and clinical factors that contribute to reward-related brain responses with meta-regression analysis. Based on the literature reviewed above, we expected to find abnormal brain activation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in CHR individuals compared with healthy controls (HC) during anticipation. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Search Strategy \n  \nA comprehensive literature search of whole-brain fMRI studies comparing CHR individuals and HC was carried out in the PubMed ( ), Web of Science ( ), and ScienceDirect ( ) databases from January 1, 2000, to May 1, 2022. The search terms used were (1) \u201cschizophrenia\u201d OR \u201cschizophrenic\u201d OR \u201cschizoaffective\u201d OR \u201cSchizotypy\u201d OR \u201cpsychosis\u201d OR \u201cpsychotic\u201d; (2) \u201chigh risk\u201d OR \u201cultra-high risk\u201d OR \u201cat-risk mental state\u201d OR \u201cclinical risk\u201d OR \u201cbasic symptoms\u201d OR \u201cpsychotic-like experiences\u201d OR \u201cprodromal phase\u201d; (3) \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d; and (4) \u201cmonetary incentive delay task\u201d OR \u201cMID\u201d OR \u201cSalience Attribution Task\u201d OR \u201cSAT\u201d OR \u201creward anticipation.\u201d To increase the chances of identifying additional, relevant studies, the reference lists of the included articles and relevant review papers were manually searched. For studies without available coordinates at the whole-brain level, we asked the authors whether they could provide such information. If the authors did not respond, we excluded their studies if we could not obtain coordinate information and included their studies if we could not obtain some clinical data (e.g., psychiatric symptom scale score) but could obtain coordinate information. The flow diagram of the inclusion and exclusion process of the selected articles is described in  . \n  \nFlow diagram of the inclusion and exclusion process of selected articles. Of the 439 articles initially identified, a total of 13 studies were enrolled for the reward anticipation meta-analysis. CHR, clinical high risk for schizophrenia; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; HC, healthy controls; MID, monetary incentive delay; ROI, region of interest; SAT, salience attribution test.  \n  \nStudies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) included CHR individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, or a recent decline in functioning ( ;  ); (2) reported neuroimaging findings allowing a comparison of CHR and HC groups; (3) investigated fMRI brain responses during reward anticipation; and (4) reported significant results as 3D coordinates in either the Talairach or the Montreal Neurological Institute space based on a whole\u00adbrain analysis. \n\nThe exclusion criteria included the following: (1) publications were case reports, book chapters, reviews, or meta-analyses; (2) individuals were clinically diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; (3) absence of a control group; and (4) studies reported only region of interest findings. Four fMRI studies including unaffected relatives/siblings of SZ patients were thus not included in our meta-analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). For 1 study where multiple independent CHR samples were compared with HC, the appropriate coordinates were included as separate datasets ( ). \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThe following data were recorded from each article: sample sizes, mean age, percentage of males, ethnicity, education level, income, collection site, severity of positive and negative symptoms, task performance (including the reaction time [RT], RT acceleration [mean RT differences between gain/loss and neutral conditions], hit rate, and total amount gain), and several MRI methodological parameters (including the MRI field strengths, imaging data analysis software, and the statistical threshold). \n\nTo facilitate the comparison of different scales used in different studies, a common variable of positive/negative symptoms was created. First, we extracted the mean and SD of the positive/negative symptom dimension from the included articles as measured by the following rating scales: the Community Assessment of Psychic Experience, Chapman Social Anhedonia Scale, Revised Chapman Social Anhedonia Scale, Revised Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale, Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States interview, and Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes. For each measure of symptoms, we then rescaled each sample mean score according to the highest obtainable score on each particular instrument. For samples with more than 1 measure reported, the average value was calculated and recorded. \n\nThis meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines ( ). A 9-point checklist was used to evaluate study rigorousness via an objective description of the individual studies (  for the full criteria). The literature search, quality evaluation, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 investigators. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and, when necessary, by consulting a third member of the meta-analysis team. Kappa statistics showed a high agreement between reviewers for study selection (k\u2009=\u20090.78,   P  \u2009<\u2009.01). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and assessments of study quality are provided in the  . \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Relevant Studies \n  \nReward-related activation differences during reward anticipation between CHR individuals and HC were analyzed using seed-based d mapping (SDM) software (version 5.15,  ), which combined peak coordinates and statistical parametric maps, and used standard effect size and variance-based meta-analytic calculations. This method has been widely applied in previous meta-analyses of structural and fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ). In the SDM analysis, studies reporting no significant group differences can be included, and both positive and negative differences can be reconstructed in the same map. Therefore, it is an optimal method for comparing CHR individuals with HC without biasing the results ( ;  ). \n\nThe SDM methods and steps have been described in detail elsewhere ( ). First, peak coordinates and corresponding statistics of task-evoked brain activation differences between CHR individuals and HC were extracted from the included articles, and maps of statistics other than   t   values, such as   Z   scores and   P   values, were converted in advance into   t   values by online converters. Second, standard Montreal Neurological Institute maps of the differences in anticipation-related activation were created by means of a Gaussian kernel. Third, the mean map was calculated and weighted by the squared root of the sample size of each study. The default kernel size and statistical thresholds were as follows: full width at half maximum\u2009=\u200920 mm,   P  \u2009=\u2009.005, peak height threshold\u2009=\u20091, and extent threshold\u2009=\u200910 (Radua et al.,  ,  ). \n\nIn addition, to examine the effect of potential confounding variables and moderators on abnormal task-evoked activation as well as to assess the robustness of the findings, complementary analyses, including jackknife sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression analyses, were performed. We performed meta-regression analyses with a strict threshold of   P  \u2009<\u2009.0005 and considered only the brain regions identified in the main analysis of brain activation differences between the CHR and HC groups during reward anticipation (Radua et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nFourteen datasets from 13 whole-brain fMRI studies with 318 CHR individuals (mean age\u2009=\u200923.30 years; percentage of males\u2009=\u200955.00%) and 426 HC (mean age\u2009=\u200923.24 years; percentage of males\u2009=\u200959.00%) were included during the reward anticipation phase ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). No significant difference was found for age (  t  \u2009=\u20090.025,   P  \u2009=\u2009.659) or sex (\u03c7 \u2009=\u20091.626,   P  \u2009=\u2009.202) between the CHR and HC groups. The participant demographics and imaging characteristics of the included articles are provided in  . \n  \nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis \n    \n\n### Main Meta-Analysis \n  \nIn the pooled meta-analysis of reward anticipation, relative to the HC, the CHR individuals exhibited higher activations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lower activations in the left cerebellum (extending to the parahippocampal gyrus), right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and right insula (extending to the putamen) in response to monetary stimuli ( ;  ). \n  \nResults of the Anticipation Meta-Analysis for Brain Activation Difference Between CHR Individuals and HC \n      \nTask-evoked activation differences during reward anticipation between clinical high risk for schizophrenia (CHR) individuals and healthy controls (HC) in the meta-analysis. Brain regions that showed significant differences in anticipation-evoked activity in CHR individuals relative to HC. Red indicates regions that showed hyperactivity in CHR individuals relative to HC, and blue indicates regions that showed hypoactivity in patients relative to HC. The color scale represents probability values from statistical permutation testing (  Z   values). For the main analysis of the anticipation stage, CHR individuals showed increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) but decreased activations in the left cerebellum (extending to the parahippocampal gyrus), right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and right insula (extending to the putamen).  \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n  \nThe mean score for quality assessment was 8.5 out of 9 points (range = 8\u20139 points), as shown in supplementary  . In the whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis, the decreased activation in the left cerebellum was preserved in all included datasets. The hyperactivations in the mPFC and ACC remained significant in 13 datasets and failed to emerge in 1 dataset ( ). The hypoactivity in the right SMG and right insula remained significant in 13 datasets and failed to emerge in 1 dataset ( ) ( ). \n  \nSubgroup and Jackknife Sensitivity Analyses in Brain Activation Difference Between CHR Individuals and HC During Reward Anticipation Stage \n    \n\n### Heterogeneity and Bias Analyses \n  \nAs shown in  , there was no significant between-study heterogeneity in any of the peak coordinates. Additionally, Egger\u2019s test showed no \u201csmall study\u201d bias (  P\u2009  >\u2009.05) for any of the clusters reported as significant ( ). See   for detailed results. \n\n\n### Subgroup Analyses \n  \nTo control for any possible differences observed between studies, the subgroup analyses were repeated to include only those studies that were methodologically homogenous. Therefore, we conducted subgroup analyses for those datasets including only adult CHR individuals, for those including CHR individuals without comorbidities, for those using the MID paradigm, and for those using a 3-T MRI scanner. The main results of the meta-analysis remained largely unchanged when the analyses were repeated in all subgroup analyses, except for the adult subgroup analysis. For the adult subgroup analysis, the hyperactivation in the mPFC and ACC in the pooled main analysis did not remain significant. The hypoactivation in the left cerebellum, right SMG, and right insula in the adult subgroup analysis was consistent with that in the pooled main analysis. The detailed results are shown in  . \n\n\n### Meta-Regression Analyses \n  \nMeta-regression analysis revealed that the mean age, percentage of males, positive and negative symptom severity, RT, RT acceleration, and hit rate were not linearly associated with task-related activation during reward anticipation. The effect of other variables, including ethnicity, education level, income, and total amount gain on brain activation, could not be explored due to insufficient data. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn the current whole-brain meta-analysis of brain activation from published reward-related fMRI studies, we examined the neural basis of monetary anticipation in CHR individuals. Our whole-brain meta-analysis provided evidence that CHR individuals showed increased anticipation-related activations in the mPFC and ACC cortical regions but decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuit, including the right putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus, left cerebellum, right SMG, and right insula. These findings in the CHR group confirmed brain reward-related activation during reward anticipation while performing the reward task, which might indicate a broader vulnerability to motivational-related symptoms in persons at risk for psychosis. \n\nIn the present study, we observed hyperactivity in response to monetary reward in the mPFC and ACC during reward anticipation in CHR individuals. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have also identified exaggerated prefrontal activity during reward processing in populations at high familial risk for psychosis ( ;  ;  ;  ), ultra-high risk populations ( ;  ), and healthy people with SZ risk\u2013associated genes ( ). In particular, the PFC dysfunction found in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis is associated with an increased risk for transition to psychosis ( ). The frontal lobe regions, including the mPFC and ACC, have been reported to play a role in learning reward associations, selecting reward goals, choosing actions to obtain reward, and monitoring the potential value of switching to alternative courses of action ( ). In detail, the ACC is important for value integration to guide effort-based decisions in humans and reflect both anticipated effort and anticipated reward ( ;  ). The frontal medial regions of the prefrontal cortex, having reciprocal connectivity with several neuromodulatory systems, are key components of neural circuits involved in detecting the motivational significance of external stimuli ( ). These results support the \u201caberrant salience\u201d notion that psychotic symptoms may arise from inappropriately attributing salience to irrelevant stimuli. The increased responses of the mPFC/ACC in CHR individuals may be due to oversensitivity to the salience of external stimuli and reward monitoring ( ). Another possible explanation is that the prefrontal cortex exerts top-down control over the interaction between midbrain dopaminergic systems and the striatum, and increased activity in the PFC may inhibit reward-related behavior ( ). The hyperactivation in these regions was considered to be a compensatory mechanism for structural and functional deficits of the mesolimbic system ( ;  ). Thus, our findings of greater responses in the mPFC and cingulate cortex may suggest increased reward expectation, salience processing, and cognitive responses to the task or could be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the changes in the mesolimbic regions. \n\nIn contrast, we found that CHR individuals exhibited decreased activation in the mesolimbic system, including the putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, SMG, and cerebellum, during reward anticipation. A considerable number of fMRI studies have revealed a correlation between activity in the ventral and dorsal striatum and reward prediction error in regard to both primary rewards ( ) and monetary rewards ( ). Individuals with CHR also exhibited reduced striatal activity during reward anticipation compared with controls, which has been widely reported in previous studies ( ). Volumes in the putamen, whose output is modulated by dopaminergic inputs, are known to be abnormal in SZ ( ;  ) and in individuals at high risk for psychosis ( ;  ). Given the key role of dorsal striatal regions in anticipatory or motivational components of reward-seeking behavior, the smaller volume and reduced activity in the putamen may be a neural substrate for anticipatory anhedonia and an indication of an earlier high-risk stage ( ). The insula is widely connected to many areas of the cortex and limbic system involved in reward and decision-making, such as the frontal pole, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ACC, and striatum ( ). Human and animal studies have implicated the insula in the assessment of stimuli and the allocation of appropriate arousal for motor preparation and selective attention, 2 processes that play key roles in the MID task ( ). These processes may be inhibited in CHR individuals, thus leading to decreased activation in the insula during the anticipation of reward ( ). Additionally, the hippocampal-parahippocampal region showed both reduced activity and reduced coupling during declarative memory with fMRI in high-risk populations, thus reflecting abnormal memory function in at-risk individuals ( ). The current findings highlight mesolimbic circuit dysfunction in the pursuit of reward, which contributes to motivational impairment in the risk state of psychosis. \n\nOur meta-analysis also revealed that blunted brain activation was found in the cerebellum in CHR individuals compared with HC. By sending direct excitatory projections to the ventral tegmental area, the cerebellum can modulate brain-wide reward circuitry ( ). Recent evidence has indicated that granule cells in the cerebellum encode salient predictive information about the future and signal reward expectations ( ). An accumulating body of work has also highlighted cerebellar dysfunction in psychosis-risk individuals (Bernard et al.,  ,  ). Abnormal cerebellar activation in CHR may imply difficulties in learning and achieving automaticity in task execution. Therefore, our finding of reduced cerebellar activation could be a neural substrate for reward anticipation-related deficits in CHR individuals. \n\nThe findings of decreased activation in the right SMG in the CHR group with respect to the controls have previously been reported in reward anticipation ( ). Anatomically, the SMG is one of the largest areas of the inferior parietal lobule, a key region that receives and recognizes visual information activated by visual cortices ( ). SMG abnormalities may reflect deficits in recognizing reward expected visual cues among CHR individuals. Similarly, an fMRI study on CHR individuals also reported decreased activation of the SMG during the N-Back task ( ). Compared with the prefrontal cortex or cingulate, the SMG appears to be relatively overlooked, although it has been widely considered a crucial component of the impaired frontal\u2013limbic\u2013temporal\u2013parietal network involved in the SZ development process ( ). Here, we provided evidence for this finding by showing decreased SMG activity in CHR individuals compared with that in controls. \n\nNotably, the subgroup analyses showed that the increased brain activity in the mPFC/ACC did not survive in the adult CHR subgroup analyses. The critical role of the mPFC and ACC in reward prediction, reinforcement learning, and prompting effortful behavior has been widely documented ( ). In line with previous studies, we found that hyperactivity in these regions appeared to be more pronounced in younger participants ( ;  ). Uniquely adolescent characteristics such as risk-taking behavior and impulsivity are typical of this age and might substantially contribute to both psychological and neurobiological vulnerability in those groups ( ;  ). Some evidence supported that adolescent risk-taking behavior might be driven by disproportionately increased activation of the motivational circuit by potential gain cues relative to the influence of inhibitory circuits ( ;  ). Together, our subgroup results suggested that adolescents exhibited more recruitment of the mPFC/ACC region while anticipating responses for gains than adults. Future studies could conduct longitudinal research on the at-risk individuals or directly compare adult CHR individuals with young CHR individuals to better observe the potential effect of neurodevelopmental mechanisms associated with reward processing. \n\nConsidering the significance of brain-behavior association, it is important to investigate relationships between brain measures and behavioral performance. However, in our current study, correlations between task performance (RT, RT acceleration, and hit rate) and monetary-induced activities were not significant. Many previous studies and reviews have disentangled the relationships between MID variables and symptom deficits, and there is tentative but mixed evidence for the association. At the behavioral level, the HC group appeared to win a higher cumulative total of money ( ) and show a faster response to reward ( ) or a higher hit rate ( ) compared with high-risk individuals. Moreover, most studies have suggested an association between monetary reward deficits and psychotic symptoms ( ;  ) such that poor MID is associated with more pronounced psychotic symptoms. However, several studies have also reported that RT ( ), monetary win ( ), and hit rate ( ) did not differ in high-risk individuals. At the neural level, 1 study revealed that insular activation was negatively correlated with RT acceleration (as indexed by the mean RT difference between neutral and salience conditions) during the presentation of salient stimuli compared with that during the presentation of neutral stimuli ( ). This may imply that insular activation in CHR individuals was associated with impaired discrimination of salience and could be linked to aberrant motivational salience processing in CHR individuals. Another study found that the risk population showed increased ACC activity with a gain in reaction speed but at the expense of correctness during a choice reaction task ( ). Considering the function of the PFC/ACC in mediating the cognitive control of response selection ( ), enhanced neural activation may reflect more focus on, more effort required for, or improved efficiency in modulating, coordinating, and integrating goal-relevant information within the task demand. The null results in the current meta-regression analysis can be attributed to multiple sources, such as clinical features, cue features of the employed paradigm, and data processing strategy. Clearly, whether incentive salience\u2013induced brain activity directly correlates with actual behavioral responses will be an important question for future study. \n\nFocusing on common and distinct dysfunctional patterns of brain activation between CHR groups and SZ groups is of great significance to delineate neurobiological characteristics in different stages of psychosis. Although we did not make a direct comparison of SZ and CHR individuals in the current meta-analysis, compared with the results of recent meta-analyses focusing on SZ, we found that SZ and CHR individuals showed similar brain hypoactivation patterns in the mesolimbic circuit but different activation profiles in the PFC/ACC during reward anticipation ( ;  ). Importantly, SZ exhibited reduced anticipation-related activity in both ventral and dorsal striatal regions ( ), whereas the CHR group showed reduced activation only in the DS region. Hypoactivation in the dorsal and VS during the anticipation of monetary incentives was also observed in first-episode SZ patients ( ;  ;  ;  ), chronic SZ patients (Juckel, et al.,  ,  ), and their unaffected first-degree relatives ( ;  ). Our finding of only DS hypoactivation in CHR individuals is in contrast to findings of decreased activation in the VS in patients ( ) and siblings of patients ( ) but is in line with the findings of 1 study in people with subclinical psychotic experiences ( ). DS dysfunction in the CHR group may suggest impairment in the construction of associations between monetary rewards and cues, thereby impeding salience attribution ( ). Contrary to the finding of decreased activations in the PFC/ACC in SZ patients ( ;  ), CHR individuals exhibited increased mPFC/ACC activation in our meta-analysis. This is consistent with results from a previous study that the high-risk sample exhibited enhanced activation in the superior frontal gyrus and the cingulate cortex ( ). These results may provide evidence that PFC/ACC activity could be disturbed before the transition to psychosis, and this pattern is different from that of SZ patients. However, shared and unique functional brain activity patterns between psychotic patients and high-risk individuals need to be clarified in future studies. \n\nExploring the pathophysiology in at-risk individuals prior to psychosis onset is potentially important for early diagnosis and intervention. SZ is now considered to be a brain disorder and developmental disorder rather than only a psychological conflict or stable disease ( ). The onset of mental illness generally occurs early, but its diagnosis is delayed ( ). One of the possible interpretations of this phenomenon is that clinical and neurobiological profiles in the early phases are unlike those in the later phases ( ). In our current meta-analysis, our findings of distinct patterns of enhanced responses in the mPFC and ACC and lower reactivity in the mesolimbic circuit in CHR individuals may represent a putative biomarker in individuals at high risk for psychosis. These patterns may contribute to our understanding of abnormalities in the CHR population, thus offering great potential to identify reliable biomarkers of psychosis prodrome and diagnostic criteria for presyndromal SZ. Furthermore, by studying individuals with a risk of developing this pathology, CHR research will help guide the development of an evidence-based early intervention for reducing symptoms or preventing the transition to psychosis. Such research may also help to improve the prediction of subsequent psychosis. However, translating these findings into clinical practice is a challenge, and further research is needed to produce clinically validated biomarkers and proven therapeutic strategies for psychotic disorders. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations should be considered when assessing the impact of these findings. First, instead of focusing on cross-sectional studies, longitudinally following individuals to identify functional alterations would have been ideal. A longitudinal study could be performed to determine whether the altered trajectories of brain activation during reward tasks precede psychosis onset and predict the transition to psychosis in a high-risk group. Second, the correlations between reward-related activation and task performance variable (including total amount gain) could not be investigated because of insufficient data. Third, this meta-analysis is unable to indicate whether the reported monetary response is reflective of psychosis-specific risk or general vulnerability for psychopathology because all the included studies relied on healthy volunteers as a reference point and there were too few studies that recorded help-seeking information for controls. Future research will be needed to recruit help-seeking controls to elucidate psychosis-specific vulnerability mechanisms. Fourth, we included only studies that used monetary stimuli to elicit brain responses. Because clinical and CHR individuals have extensive cognitive impairment, it is not clear whether other forms of reinforcing stimuli (e.g., social and emotional stimuli) would lead to the same results. Furthermore, some reward paradigms, such as the MID task, are relatively simple, so it is difficult to identify the reinforcement learning deficits of individuals. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn summary, we demonstrated that CHR individuals showed increased activations in the prefrontal regions involving the mPFC and ACC and decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuitry during reward anticipation. Our results further support the notion that the CHR state is associated with abnormalities in reward-related brain function, thus enhancing the understanding of the pathophysiological characteristics in the CHR stage. \n\n\n## Supplementary Materials \n  \nSupplementary data are available at   International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology (IJNPPY)   online. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 10109154, "text_md5": "e3c0df361aeb27e1e6e76f550933cd0a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 112], "journal": [113, 139], "publication_year": [141, 145], "title": [156, 265], "keywords": [279, 351], "abstract": [364, 2010], "body": [2019, 37257]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36893068, "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyad009", "pmcid": "10109154", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10109154", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10109154"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10109154\">10109154</a>", "list_title": "PMC10109154  A Meta-Analysis of Neural Correlates of Reward Anticipation in Individuals at Clinical Risk for Schizophrenia"}

Understanding people\u2019s neural responses to high-calorie food cues might help to develop better interventions for preventing or reducing overeating and weight gain. In this review, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of viewing high-calorie food cues in both normal-weight people and people with obesity. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles, retrieving 59 eligible studies containing 2410 unique participants. The results of an activation likelihood estimation indicate large clusters in a range of structures, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, insula/frontal operculum, culmen, as well as the middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Conjunction analysis suggested that both normal-weight people and people with obesity activated OFC, supporting that the two groups share common neural substrates of reward processing when viewing high-calorie food cues. The contrast analyses did not show significant activations when comparing obesity with normal-weight. Together, these results provide new important evidence for the neural mechanism underlying high-calorie food cues processing, and new insights into common and distinct brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues between people with obesity and normal-weight people. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nThe prevalence of obesity is problematic and rising in both developed and developing nations [ ]. This fact has far-reaching and costly implications, because obesity contributes to the development of numerous diseases (e.g., diabetes, some cancers) [ , , ], and it is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) [ ]. Not surprisingly, excessive weight has become an increasing threat to healthcare systems [ ], and accounts for an estimated 2.8 million deaths per annum worldwide [ ]. These statistics have prompted a plethora of research aimed at understanding factors that contribute to the development or maintenance of obesity [ , , , , ]. \n\nOne contributing factor is the overconsumption of high-calorie or unhealthy foods (e.g., chocolate cake), and underconsumption of low-calorie or healthy foods (e.g., salad), which leads to a positive energy balance and, subsequently, weight gain [ , , ]. We are currently facing the rise of the \u2018obesogenic\u2019 environment [ ] where the exposure to food advertisements, and availability of cheap, unhealthy, and energy dense foods has dramatically increased [ , ]. The constant exposure to high-calorie foods and food cues may promote overconsumption by stimulating brain reward and motivation pathways [ , ]. In this vein, using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (  f  MRI), a growing number of research has been conducted to investigate neural responses to various forms of food stimuli [ ], such as liquid tastants, food odors [ ], or visual food cues [ , ]. Moreover, recent reviews have used   f  MRI-based meta-analysis such as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ , ] to evaluate the consistency of findings across these studies [ , , , , , , , ]. For instance, Chen and Zeffiro meta-analyzed 39 experiments with 995 participants and found that taste (e.g, insula), sensory integration (e.g., postcentral gyrus), and reward processing (e.g., amygdala) regions were involved in processing sweet food cues (one kind of high-calorie foods) [ ]. With regard to visual food cues, several   f  MRI-based meta-analyses have also been conducted [ , , , ]. For example, an ALE meta-analysis including 12 experiments and 201 participants reported that visual food cues were reliably associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the visual system proper (e.g., the occipital lobe) rather than reward-related brain network (e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex) [ ]. \n\nNone of the aforementioned meta-analyses, however, have investigated which brain regions are concurrently activated in response to viewing high-calorie food cues specifically. Furthermore, most of these meta-analyses only included participants with normal-weight and did not consider individuals with obesity (i.e., body mass index \u226530. A meta-analysis pooling data across relevant   f  MRI studies would therefore be warranted, as it may help to understand neural responses of viewing high-calorie food cues among people with various weight-status categories (e.g., normal-weight, obesity) and develop better interventions for preventing or reducing overeating and obesity. \n\nIn the present study, we conducted   f  MRI meta-analyses of viewing high-calorie food cues to address four novel aspects. First and foremost, we investigated brain activations related to high-calorie visual food cues. Second, we meta-analyzed not only studies involving normal-weight people, but also studies involving participants with obesity. Third, we performed conjunction and contrast analyses to assess common and distinct brain activations between normal-weight people and people with obesity (e.g., normal-weight \u2229 obesity; normal-weight versus obesity). Last but not least, we utilized a new version of GingerALE brain map software (3.0.2) which was revised because of the implementation errors in multiple comparisons corrections in its old version [ ]. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Study Selection and Inclusion Criteria \n  \nThe current meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines ( ). A protocol for this work was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF:  ). To obtain functional imaging studies of viewing high-calorie food cues for use in the current meta-analysis, a topic search in the databases PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses was conducted for all papers published before 9th August 2021. The following string was used to search for the titles, abstracts and keywords of papers: ((neuroimaging OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cpositron-emission tomography\u201d OR PET OR fMRI) AND (food) AND (images OR pictures)). In this search, PubMed returned 301 results, Web of Science returned 1388 results, PsycINFO returned 262 results, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses returned 46 results. Abstracts of articles were reviewed, and the full text of an article was read whenever a paper\u2019s title or abstract indicated that the study might be relevant to analyses. In addition, to help ensure that all studies on the topic of interest were included, references from relevant articles were reviewed, and studies that were potentially relevant were examined from those references.   outlines the detailed study selection procedure. \n\nStudies were incorporated into this research if they (1) were in English, (2) used   f  MRI, (3) used whole-brain analysis, (4) involved populations with normal-weight, overweight, or obesity. In samples of adult participants, a group with obesity was defined as an average body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m  or above, a group with overweight as an average BMI between 25 and 29.99 kg/m , and a group with normal-weight as an average BMI between 18.5 and 24.99 kg/m . In samples of children/adolescents, obesity was defined as a BMI percentile of 95th or above, overweight as a BMI between the 85th and 94.99th percentile, and normal-weight as a BMI between the 5th and 84.99th percentile; if BMI percentile was not reported, international cutoff points of BMI were used for defining obesity and overweight [ ], (5) used a viewing task (e.g., passive viewing task) in which cues of high-calorie foods were presented; Studies employing inhibitory control task, food choice task, or delay discounting task were excluded, (6) reported analyses for the contrast high-calorie foods > non-foods or low-calorie foods, (7) brain coordinates were available in Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach space. If information crucial to our meta-analysis was not available in an article, we requested it from the corresponding authors. In addition, we excluded studies that explicitly indicated that all their participants are from special population (e.g., cancer survivors) or had a known eating disorder (e.g., binge eating disorder). Finally, when two studies used overlapping samples, we only included the study with a larger sample size. \n\n\n### 2.2. Activation Likelihood Estimation Analysis \n  \nMeta-analyses were conducted in GingerALE brain map software (3.0.2) ( ), according to standard procedures outlined in the GingerALE user manual. Coordinates were extracted from whole-brain results, and those reported in Talairach space were transformed into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space using the automated transformation tool implemented in GingerALE. GingerALE algorithm minimizes within-experiment effects\u2014clusters are more likely to represent agreement between experiments than being driven by individual research [ ]. Because of this, we included all of the reported activation coordinates if a study included both the contrast high-calorie foods > non-food and high-calorie foods > low-calorie foods, as it was unlikely that a single study would bias the analyses (see   for the results of analyzing high-calorie vs. neutral and high-calorie vs. low-calorie contrasts separately). Similarly, foci obtained from contrasts in fasting and fed conditions were also merged. \n\nAs a first step, we performed an overall meta-analysis on activation foci derived from all the included articles investigating brain activation in response to viewing high-calorie visual food cues. We then performed two separate ALE analyses on two categories of studies in relation to the weight status of the participants (normal-weight or obesity) (Because only 12 independent samples included participants with overweight (for more, see  ), we do not present a separate meta-analysis on these overweight-related studies given the lack of statistical power). Following the guidelines of previous work [ , , ], the cluster determining threshold was set at a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.01 and a voxel-level cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### 2.3. Modulation Effect of Sex \n  \nWe extracted per-voxel probabilities of activation in the meta-analysis for each of the identified brain regions to examine potential modulating effect of sex on the results of our analysis. \n\n\n### 2.4. Conjunction and Contrast Analyses \n  \nTo compare the results of pairwise meta-analysis (e.g., normal weight vs. obesity; normal weight vs. overweight/obesity), we performed conjunction and contrast analyses in GingerALE. Following the recommendations by Eickhoff et al. (2016) [ ], the cluster determining threshold was set at   p   < 0.01 with 10,000 permutations and a minimum cluster size of 200 mm . \n\n\n### 2.5. Results Visualization \n  \nFor visualization purposes, all results were projected onto an MNI-space template brain (e.g., MNI152.nii) using MRIcroGL ( ). \n\n\n### 2.6. Study Quality Assessment \n  \nA 7-item quality scale modified from Nichol et al. (2018) [ ] was used to assess the quality of the included studies (see   for study quality of each included study). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nOur search identified 59 eligible studies (total   m   = 59) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ], 68 independent samples (total   k   = 68), and a total of 2410 participants (total   N   = 2410). A complete list of studies and their characteristics can be seen in  . Of these 59 studies, 39 independent samples (  k   = 39,   N   = 979) included participants with normal-weight, 17 independent samples (  k   = 17,   N   = 697) included participants with obesity, and 12 independent samples (  k   = 12,   N   = 734) included participants with overweight. \n\n\n### 3.2. Overall Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe primary meta-analysis that pooled data across all 68 independent samples (854 foci) revealed that high-calorie food cues activated thirteen statistically significant clusters (total volume of activation of 33,632 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0694). The results are reported in   and graphically represented in  . We observed that viewing high-calorie food cues consistently activated the bilateral lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, insula, as well as the right middle occipital gyrus, left culmen, and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). For all of the identified clusters, the modulation analysis revealed no effect of sex (all   p   values > 0.05). \n\n\n### 3.3. Brain Response to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in People with Normal-Weight \n  \nFor brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues in participants with normal-weight, the meta-analysis of 39 independent samples (493 foci) identified seven significant clusters (total volume of activation of 10,680 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0713) that covered regions of the bilateral fusiform gyrus, OFC, insula, as well as the right lingual gyrus ( ,  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Brain Response to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in People with Obesity \n  \nFor brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues in participants with obesity, the meta-analysis of 17 independent samples (216 foci) identified seven significant clusters (total volume of activation of 4952 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0533) that covered regions of the bilateral OFC, left lingual gyrus, and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ,  ). \n\n\n### 3.5. Conjunction and Contrast Analyses \n  \nTo identify clusters of activation which were common to normal-weight people and people with obesity, we carried out a conjunction analysis on the activations obtained in the previous two separate meta-analyses. The results revealed significant activations in the bilateral OFC, which was commonly activated in both normal-weight people and individuals with obesity ( ,  ). \n\nTo identify clusters of activation which were unique to normal-weight people and people with obesity, a contrast analysis was carried out between the activations obtained in the previous two separate meta-analyses. The analysis revealed no significant activations. \n\nFinally, we conducted additional analyses with overweight and obese as one group and compared this combined group with the normal weight group ( ). Conjunction analysis revealed significant activations in the bilateral OFC, fusiform gyrus, and the left insula, which were commonly activated in both normal-weight people and individuals with obesity/overweight. The obesity/overweight minus normal-weight subtraction analysis displayed 2 significant clusters located in the bilateral culmen. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nBy meta-analyzing 59   f  MRI studies and 68 independent samples, we showed a network of brain regions related to viewing high-calorie food cues. Further, we presented two separate meta-analyses to examine neural responses of viewing high-calorie food cues in normal-weight people or people with obesity, and investigated the common and differential neural responses between these two groups. Although some meta-analyses have been conducted on this topic before [ , , , ], to the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to examine the neural mechanisms of viewing high-calorie food cues across groups with a different weight-status. \n\nWe found that, overall, viewing high-calorie food cues was associated with increased activity in a network of brain regions located in the bilateral lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, OFC, amygdala, insula, as well as the right middle occipital gyrus, left culmen, and the right IFG. The conjunction analysis suggested that viewing high-calorie food cues activated the OFC in both normal-weight people and people with obesity. Different from the conclusions from previous reviews on the topic of food cue reactivity in obesity [ , ], but similar to the viewpoint of a behavioral meta-analysis of food cue reactivity [ ], the contrast analysis revealed no significant activations when comparing groups with obesity to groups with normal-weight (more on this in  ). \n\n### 4.1. Core Brain Regions Activated by High-Calorie Visual Food Cues \n  \nOur overall results are similar to a previous meta-analysis focusing on the functional neuroanatomy of high-calorie food liquid processing (e.g., sweet liquid) [ ].  \n\nThe amygdala and OFC are connected with each other and frequently activated in food studies. The amygdala is thought to form the core of a neural system for fear processing [ ]. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the amygdala also plays a prominent role in mediating positive/reward stimuli processing [ ]. These findings have led to the viewpoint that the amygdala\u2019s predominant role may be the detection of and response to motivationally important stimuli [ ]. In addition, it was proposed that the amygdala was responsible for forming an \u201caffective tag\u201d to the salient stimuli [ ]. Therefore, the amygdala activations that we found in current meta-analysis are likely to reflect the salience and emotional impacts of high-calorie food cues. The OFC receives information from brain regions involved in sensory processing (e.g., insula, fusiform gyrus), affective processing (e.g., amygdala), and memory (e.g., hippocampus), and plays a prominent role in integrating, encoding, and retrieving reward value about stimulus [ ]. There is a strong and consistent activation of the OFC in reward-related tasks such as decision-making tasks [ ] or cue-reactivity tasks [ ]. Further, several studies have shown that the magnitude of activity in this region correlated with pleasantness or tastiness ratings of food/food cues [ , , ]. Therefore, the OFC activations in current study could reflect the process of monitoring and encoding higher reward value of high-calorie food cues. It should be noted that we did not find that \u201cclassical\u201d reward areas such as the nucleus accumbens, putamen, or caudate were involved in processing of high-calorie visual food cues. This is different from a previous meta-analysis which showed that the putamen and caudate exhibited responses to high-calorie liquids [ ]. Although comparing across meta-analyses is difficult given differences in included studies, we could speculate that reward areas are more likely to be activated when people are eating/tasting high-calorie foods rather than viewing high-calorie food cues. \n\nThe insula/frontal operculum has been identified as the primary taste cortex [ , ]. The activation of this taste cortex in response to high-calorie visual food cues may represent memory retrieval of previous gustatory experiences with these palatable foods [ ]. In addition, the insula has also been highlighted as a region that plays an important role in craving for drugs (e.g., cocaine) [ ] and foods [ ]. Therefore, it is also possible that insula activation is the result of high urges to eat in participants exposed to calorie-rich and appetizing food pictures [ ]. \n\nWe also found some evidence that the culmen was activated by high-calorie food cues. Although traditionally considered a major motor structure of the brain, there is evidence that the culmen/cerebellum plays a broader role in homeostatic regulation [ ], and shows connections with limbic and reward systems [ ]. Given that both the meta-analysis of neural responses to sweet stimuli by Chen and Zeffiro [ ] and the current meta-analysis found that the cerebellum increases activity in response to food simulation, future studies and theories of eating behavior may benefit from inclusion of cerebellar influences in their hypotheses forming process. \n\nThe remiaining significant clusters found in response to high-calorie visual food cues were located in the occipitotemporal gyrus (the bilateral lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus). These visual areas consistently respond to multiple drug-related (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco) [ ] and gaming cues [ ]. Drawing parallels it is conceivable that higher reward salience of higher reward salience of high-calorie food images modulate neural activity in these visual areas, just as drug-related cues do, and leads to different visual processing when compared to control images. \n\n\n### 4.2. Common and Specific Brain Activations between Normal-Weight and Obesity \n  \nFrom an evolutionary perspective, energy-dense foods confer a greater survival advantage for primate species, including humans. From this viewpoint, researchers argued that our species has a natural preference for high-calorie foods [ ], which then could be perceived as more rewarding. In light of this, the results of our conjunction analysis\u2013increased activity in the OFC, a reward-related brain area \u2013 are not surprising. \n\nThe null findings in the contrast analysis between groups of individuals with normal-weight and obesity are different from the conclusions from previous reviews on the topic of cue reactivity in obesity. Past work showed that obesity was related to an enhanced reward/salience response towards (high-calorie) food stimuli [ , ]. It should be noted that these reviews included studies using other stimuli than high-calorie food pictures (e.g., gustatory stimuli, such as chocolate milkshakes), which might lead to different conclusions than our work. Indeed, when only included studies using food pictures, two newly published meta-analyses found similar results to current work [ , ]. For example, Morys and colleagues [ ] meta-analyzed 13 studies that investigated group differences (obese vs. normal-weight) in responses to food vs. non-food pictures viewing, and found little evidence for obesity-related differences in brain responses to food cues. In addition, our results are in line with the behavioral literature, as a meta-analysis including 45 published reports did not find evidence for the influence of BMI on food cue reactivity [ ]. Taken together, current evidence tends to support that there are no (high-calorie) visual food cue reactivity differences between normal-weight people and people with obesity. Intuitively, this conclusion might contradict some findings of longitudinal studies on the topic of cue reactivity, which found that behavioral and neural responses to food cues predict weight gain [ , ]. However, researchers argued that food cue reactivity is not the only factor that influences food intake and weight gain [ , , , ]. For instance, theories proposed that reactions to hyper-palatable food cues might lead to increased food intake and weight gain only in individuals with lower dietary self-regulation, though future research should examine whether this is the case. \n\n\n### 4.3. Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nDespite its strengths, our meta-analysis has some limitations. First and foremost, like most   f  MRI meta-analyses, we incorporated only the reported significant brain activation peaks from the included studies, which resulted in some information loss (e.g., not significant small clusters of activations) of the original fMRI data. We recommend that future studies share their original data or unthresholded statistical maps on a data repository such as Neurovault (e.g.,  ), and an image-based meta-analysis of the neural correlates of viewing high-calorie food cues will be possible when sufficient raw data or statistical maps are available. Second, not all corresponding authors answered our requests for data. In addition, some studies which would be eligible for our meta-analysis did not report the main effects of high-calorie visual food cues on BOLD changes. As such, we recommend that future studies report these results in their   even if these contrasts might not be the key focus of the study. Next, obesity was operationalized via BMI in this meta-analysis, which is a relatively coarse measure of body density and may overlook relevant physical characteristics, such as body fat and anthropometric features. Last but not least, we did not examine the neural effect of high-calorie visual food cues in people who are overweight because of the relatively small number of studies. Moreover, compared to the number of normal-weight studies, the number of studies involved people with obesity was relatively small. Thus, more research is needed to investigate the neural effects of viewing high-calorie food cues in people with overweight/obesity. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the results of our meta-analysis suggest a core neural network of viewing high-calorie food cues, which comprise reward-related as well as visual brain areas and brain regions related to taste processing. The conjunction analysis suggests that groups of individuals with normal-weight and obesity share common neural substrates of reward processing when viewing high-calorie food cues. Finally, there seem to be no differences in neural processing of high-calorie food images between people with normal-weight and obesity. Together, our work provides the first meta-analytic evidence for the neural mechanism underlying high-calorie food cues processing and new insights into common and distinct brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"id": 8699077, "text_md5": "9ee1aea99da9523b3eaf0dece7958e71", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 43], "journal": [44, 53], "publication_year": [55, 59], "title": [70, 214], "keywords": [228, 300], "abstract": [313, 1746], "body": [1755, 25678]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34942889, "doi": "10.3390/brainsci11121587", "pmcid": "8699077", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8699077", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8699077"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8699077\">8699077</a>", "list_title": "PMC8699077  Brain Responses to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in Individuals with Normal-Weight or Obesity: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis"}
{"text": "Kotchoubey, Boris and Pavlov, Yuri G.\nFront Neurol, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Brain Data and the Outcome in Disorders of Consciousness\n\n# Keywords\n\nconsciousness\nimprovement criteria\nmeta-analysis\nminimally conscious state\nneurophysiological markers\nprognosis\npublication bias\nunresponsive wakefulness syndrome\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nA systematic search revealed 68 empirical studies of neurophysiological [EEG, event-related brain potential (ERP), fMRI, PET] variables as potential outcome predictors in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (diagnoses Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome [UWS] and Minimally Conscious State [MCS]). Data of 47 publications could be presented in a quantitative manner and systematically reviewed. Insufficient power and the lack of an appropriate description of patient selection each characterized about a half of all publications. In more than 80% studies, neurologists who evaluated the patients\u2019 outcomes were familiar with the results of neurophysiological tests conducted before, and may, therefore, have been influenced by this knowledge. In most subsamples of datasets, effect size significantly correlated with its standard error, indicating publication bias toward positive results. Neurophysiological data predicted the transition from UWS to MCS substantially better than they predicted the recovery of consciousness (i.e., the transition from UWS or MCS to exit-MCS). A meta-analysis was carried out for predictor groups including at least three independent studies with N\u2009>\u200910 per predictor per improvement criterion (i.e., transition to MCS versus recovery). Oscillatory EEG responses were the only predictor group whose effect attained significance for both improvement criteria. Other perspective variables, whose true prognostic value should be explored in future studies, are sleep spindles in the EEG and the somatosensory cortical response N20. Contrary to what could be expected on the basis of neuroscience theory, the poorest prognostic effects were shown for fMRI responses to stimulation and for the ERP component P300. The meta-analytic results should be regarded as preliminary given the presence of numerous biases in the data. \n \n\n# Body\n  \n\u2026the quality of methodological reporting in the social and behavioral science research literature is poor. Reports are often silent or ambiguous on important methodological and procedural matters making it difficult for the analyst to determine what was done. The metaanalyst who develops elaborate and detailed methodological criteria for study selection, therefore, will most likely find that study reports do not provide sufficient information for those criteria to be confidently applied. [Lipsey and Wilson ( ) (p. 22)] \n \nA systematic analysis of several published datasets can yield substantial new knowledge as compared with the data of each single experiment ( ). This insight, increasingly admitted during the last decades, underlies the use of meta-analyses and other kinds of quantitative reviews that can largely overcome the subjectivity and deliberateness of the \u201cgood old\u201d narrative reviews. The domain of the severe Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) is, however, still dominated by the latter genre. Thus a brief overview of journal publications about brain imaging data in DoC for the last 5\u2009years reveals that almost every fourth paper (exactly, 33 of the 137 papers) is a narrative review. Book publications further increase this number. \n\nThe notion DoC most usually includes two diagnostic entities: the vegetative state, or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), and the minimally conscious state (MCS) ( ,  ). To the best of our knowledge, the first systematic analysis of neurophysiological data in DoC was devoted to the question whether these data confirm the reality of the distinction between UWS and MCS ( ). The authors came to the conclusion that there were no reliable differences in terms of neurophysiological variables (mainly EEG, PET, and fMRI) between the two diagnoses. \n\nHannawi et al. ( ) concentrated on brain imaging studies and performed a voxel-based meta-analysis of 13 PET and fMRI studies in DoC patients, in which the corresponding data were reported. The authors identified a number of structures whose resting state activity was significantly decreased in patients as compared with healthy controls. On the other hand, they did not find convincing differences between UWS and MCS, which was in line with Liberati et al. ( ). Kondziella et al. ( ) came, however, to a different conclusion that brain connectivity data in rest and under passive stimulation (but not in active instruction conditions) reliably differ between UWS and MCS. Unfortunately, inclusion criteria in this study were not completely clear; thus the question still remains open whether late event-related brain potential (ERP) components (P300, N400) can be regarded as indicators of cortical connectivity, and therefore, the authors should either include all P300 and N400 studies in their analysis (if they answer this question positively), or exclude all of them (if they answer it negatively), but instead, they included only some of them. The data were not checked for publication bias, that is, the tendency for positive results or stronger effects to get published more readily than negative results or weaker effects ( ). The simplest index of this bias is a negative correlation between the size of the obtained effect and its reliability ( ). On the other hand, Kondziella et al. ( ) indicated a bias in patient selection. The risk of this bias was estimated as \u201chigh\u201d in 81.4% of the analyzed studies and as \u201cuncertain\u201d in further 11.6%. \n\nAlso, Bender et al. ( ) were interested in the abilities of neurophysiological techniques to distinguish between UWS and MCS. Their meta-analysis aimed not at the presence and size of the effects, but at the parameters of sensitivity and specificity. The authors concluded \u201c\u2026 that modern diagnostic techniques can already make a major contribution to the diagnostic assessment of MCS.\u201d The inspection of their empirical findings yields a modest support for this conclusion, because good sensitivity and specificity values were found only for the measures of quantitative EEG; ERP and fMRI measures revealed, to the contrary, only moderate specificity and rather low sensitivity that did not significantly differ from chance. \n\nKotchoubey ( ) carried out a quantitative analysis of 61 reports on ERPs in DoC. ERPs are the most frequently used neurophysiological technique in DoC, which, however, does not mean that they are also most useful. In general, the results of the analysis were rather disappointing. Most studies possessed such a low statistical power that their findings can at best be regarded as \u201cpreliminary results.\u201d In addition, there was strong evidence for a publication bias toward positive findings. \n\nHowever, there were good news. The above-mentioned deficits mainly concerned the studies where ERPs were compared between UWS and MCS, which largely concurs with the conclusions of Liberati et al. ( ). The negative tendencies were substantially less expressed in the literature about the relationship between ERP and the prognosis of DoC outcome. Furthermore, the power of the prognostic studies correlated positively, and the effect sizes (ESs) correlated negatively, with the rank of journals where the data were reported. This indicated that weaker but more reliable effects could be published more successfully in top-ranking journals than strong but less reliable ones. \n\nLike all areas in which there is no golden diagnostic standard, meta-analyses of novel diagnostic tests in the domain of DoC have a strong circular component. The expensive neurophysiological techniques are developed to complement imperfect clinical methods and to increase the diagnostic precision; but in a meta-analysis, these novel techniques are evaluated on the basis of the same (presumably imprecise) diagnostic criteria that these methods should improve! The lack of the golden diagnostic standard makes another strategy more preferable, i.e., a search for the measurements most reliably related to prognosis. The above-cited findings, that prognostic studies in DoC appear to have a higher quality than diagnostic studies, are in line with this view. \n\nThe aim of the present study was a systematic analysis of all publications relating any functional brain data recorded in UWS and MCS patients to their outcome several weeks or months after the measurement. Data using only anatomical brain measurements were not included in the present analysis. Each of the analyzed publications will hereafter be designated as \u201crecord.\u201d The term \u201cdataset\u201d will, in contrast, refer to any individual comparison between a neurophysiological variable (e.g., fMRI activation in a specific task) and an outcome variable (e.g., Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2014Extended, or GOSE ( )). One record can, therefore, contain many datasets. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and ES Calculation \n  \nA search in MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted on the 23 November 2017 by using search terms ((prognos* OR predict* OR outcome) AND (vegetative state OR minimally conscious state OR unresponsive wakefulness syndrome)) AND (eeg OR fmri OR event related potentials OR erp OR positron emission). No time limits were set for the search. In addition, the systematic reviews cited above in the Introduction as well as recent informal reviews on neurophysiology of DoC, were consulted. Eight hundred ninety-seven peer-reviewed records published in English, German, or Russian, were identified. After reading abstracts and removing duplicates, 822 of them were rejected as irrelevant. Full test was sought for the other 76 records. Seven of them were rejected because they did not contain any outcome data on DoC patients, or contained outcome data already published elsewhere. Further exclusion criteria were (a) case studies or series of cases; (b) using patients\u2019 survival, and not the clinical improvement, as the only prognostic criterion; (c) presentation of the results in such a general form that the size of the observed effects cannot be calculated; and (d) reporting the data of UWS and MCS patients together with other diagnoses such as coma, exit-MCS, or locked-in syndrome: on the basis of these criteria 22 records were rejected. Regarding (d), we accepted studies in which UWS and MCS data were reported together, but not those in which the sample included more than these two diagnoses and the reported data did not give the reader a possibility to distinguish between the different diagnostic groups. The process of the selection of relevant records is shown in Figure  . \n  \nFlow chart of the selection of records. \n  \nThe search resulted in 47 records containing a total of 381 datasets. These records are summarized in Table  . Effect size was calculated for each dataset (i.e., for each predictor\u2013outcome pair) on the basis of primary data on each individual patient presented in the tables of most studies, or chi-squared based on the same patient data, or the   t  -statistics. Only in one record, ES was calculated from a coefficient of correlation. All these parameters were converted into Cohen\u2019s   d   following the methods summarized by Lenhard and Lenhard ( ). If a resulting 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table contained a zero cell (e.g., all patients having a positive neurophysiological sign recovered), the blind application of the corresponding formulas results in   d  \u2009=\u2009infinite; to avoid this, we added 0.5 to all cells, as recommended by Nakagawa and Cuthill ( ). When   d  -values were included in further operations (added, averaged, etc.), they were weighted by inverse standard error (SE). \n  \nA summary of the 47 records included in the systematic review. \n  \n N (UWS/MCS) means the number of UWS and MCS patients whose outcome and neurophysiological data were available. In the case of different number of patients available for different neurophysiological measurements, only the largest number is reported; it may be less than the total number of patients in the study  . \n\n NA, not available, AFR index, Amplitude/Frequency/Reactivity index; UWS, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; MCS, minimally conscious state; EMCS, Exit form MCS; GOS(E), Glasgow Outcome Scale (Extended), GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; DRS, Disability Rating Scale; LCF, levels of cognitive functioning scale; LoC, Level of Consciousness Scale; SEP, somatosensory evoked potentials; BAEP, brain stem auditory evoked potentials; dwPLI, debiased weighted phase lag index; SPECT, single-photon emission computed tomography; CRS-R, Coma Recovery Scale-Revised  . \n  \nA big and still underestimated problem of all quantitative reviews is the plenty of non-reported data. Several authors ( \u2013 ) indicated that measured but unreported variables constitute one of the main sources of false positive findings ubiquitous in biology and psychology and thus an important cause of the contemporary \u201creplication crisis\u201d ( ). When, and only when, it was evident for both present authors from the text of a paper that a neurophysiological variable was measured but not reported in relation to the outcome (or, rarely, reported as \u201cnon-significant\u201d), the ES of this variable was assumed to be 0, and the SE of ES was assumed to be equal to the median SE calculated for the reported variables in the same record. \n\nWhen the results presented several strongly correlated predictor variables (e.g., the same EEG variable in several adjacent regions), they were regarded as representing the same \u201cconstruct\u201d ( ), and the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the construct were calculated according to the formulas\n \nwhere   M   and   M  , SD  and SD  are mean and SD values for two to-be-combined variables, respectively. (Note that the formulas are so simple because both variables have the same   N  .) \n\n\n### Outcome Criteria \n  \nThe category \u201cbad outcome\u201d for UWS and MCS patients presumed remaining in the same condition. Deaths were included in this category only if it was clear that a patient died as a direct consequence of the brain lesion, otherwise excluded from the analysis. The category \u201cgood outcome\u201d has, on the other hand, two different definitions: minimal clinical improvement or regaining full consciousness.  For MCS, both criteria are the same, because their minimal improvement implies the transition to Exit-MCS. But this is not true for UWS, because their minimal improvement means only the transition to MCS. As shown in Section \u201c ,\u201d the two different improvement criteria of UWS yield different results. \n\nAvantaggiato et al. ( ) analyzed a group of DoC patients containing children and adolescents; because the authors presented individual data of each patient, we selected the results for patients >13\u2009years only. The category \u201cgood prognosis\u201d for MCS implied the recovery of consciousness. For UWS, however, it might include either the recovery of consciousness or the transition into MCS. All 381 datasets were included in the systematic review. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nQuality of the records was estimated on the basis of the QUADAS criteria ( ) that have been tailored, as recommended in the original publication, for the specific research field. Because Kondziella et al. ( ) expressed concerns about possible bias in patient selection, we recorded whether a publication included a patient flow chart, and whether it described explicit exclusion criteria for UWS and MCS patients or simply mentioned that all patients admitted in the clinics for a particular time period were investigated. We also marked the records in which obviously more neurophysiological data were collected than reported in the analysis of outcome prediction. Another quality index was the use of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R ( )) for DoC diagnostics, because this scale, though not being golden standard, possesses substantially better psychometric qualities than all other instruments for the assessment of DoC ( ). In addition, the impact factor (IF) of the publishing journal was included as an indirect quality criterion, because the data indicate high correlation between the IF and the informal reputation of the corresponding journal among neurologists ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nTwo additional inclusion criteria for meta-analyses were (1) at least three independent records reporting the same predictor variable or variables related to the same construct and (2) each of these records includes at least 10 patients. The criteria can be regarded as very liberal because, first, only three records and only 10 patients (who further should be subdivided into at least two groups) are rather low numbers, and second, the notion of construct is rather vague and permits to include into one group, for example, studies of P300 to simple tones and to patients\u2019 own names, thus increasing heterogeneity. On the basis of these criteria, 319 datasets were excluded (of course, this number would be larger if the criteria were more conservative). The remaining 62 datasets finally entered the meta-analysis. \n\nWe used a random-effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator for pooling ESs. We assessed the level of heterogeneity between studies with a standard   Q  -test statistic as well as by   I   calculation ( ). Heterogeneity was regarded as significant when   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 or   I   >\u200950%. Potential publication bias for individual predictors was assessed with the Egger test for Funnel plot asymmetry and represented graphically with Begg\u2019s funnel plots of the ES versus its SE. Additionally, Rosenthal fail-safe test was also applied. All meta-analyses were performed using R package \u201cmetafor\u201d ( ) using inverted standard errors as weighting parameter. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Quality of Reporting \n  \nNone of the 47 records presented a flow chart depicting patient selection. The authors of 20 records (42.6%) explicitly state that they included all patients within some exactly described time period. Nine reports (19.1%) depicted at least some inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. In the remaining 18 records, patient selection was not described. \n\nMost selected records present their data either for each individual patient or as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (or SE) for each relevant group (e.g., recovered versus non-recovered). Three records present data only in a general form (e.g., as correlations). Five records (10.6%) mention the size of some effects. \n\nCRS-R was used for the diagnosis of UWS and MCS in 29 records (61.7%); other studies employed Disability Rating Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, or other less powerful instruments. \n\nQuite surprisingly, only two records explicitly state that the neurologists who assessed the outcome were blinded to the neurophysiological data collected before. In six records, blindness of the outcome might be assumed because neurophysiological examination and outcome diagnostics were performed in different institutions. These eight records (17%) were combined into one \u201cblind\u201d group. In the majority of the records (83%), the outcome was diagnosed with knowledge of the neurophysiological findings. \n\nThe median time between the measurement and the outcome assessment was 6\u2009months, mean minimal time per record was 9\u2009months (range 1\u201336\u2009months), and the mean maximal time per record 16\u2009months (range 1.5\u2013150\u2009months). In 42 records (89%), this interval was same for all the examined patients. Seven records used broad variable intervals for different patients (1\u20136, 1\u201330, 2\u20139, 6\u201338, 10\u2013150, 26\u201336, and 24\u2013144\u2009months). One publication does not report the measurement\u2013outcome interval. \n\nThe mean total sample was 31.11\u2009\u00b1\u20093.66 patients, with a median of 21 patients and a range of 5\u2013123 patients. Eight records included <10 patients, 14 records had between 10 and 19 patients. Adding the case studies filtered out at the previous stage, we come to the result that about a half of all prognostic studies included <20 patients. The records that did not describe patient selection included significantly less patients (means 14.1 versus 43.0,   t  \u2009=\u20095.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) than records describing their selection process. \n\nThe median IF of the publishing journals was 3.87, range from 0 to 44. IF did not differ between the records with correctly versus incorrectly described patient selection. We hypothesized that studies with more patients (thus having higher power) are published in more prestigious journals, but the corresponding correlation was not significant (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.26,   p  \u2009=\u20090.078). However, studies employing CRS-R were published in journals with higher IF than studies that did not use this scale:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, Mann\u2013Whitney test. A few studies with blind outcome assessment included larger sample sizes than studies without outcome blindness (  t  \u2009=\u20092.35,   p  \u2009=\u20090.023) and were also published in more prestigious journals (  p  \u2009=\u20090.046, Mann\u2013Whitney test). \n\nNotably, we did not find a significant relationship between any of the variables and the time elapsed from the neurophysiological measurement till the assessment of the outcome. Non-weighted ES correlated with the mean time between neurophysiological measurement and outcome assessment with Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.09, with minimal time per study \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.18, with maximal time per study \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.07 (all nonsignificant). For weighted ES, the corresponding correlations were 0.03, \u22120.06, and \u22120.11, respectively (all nonsignificant). Likewise, correlations of the time interval with the SD of ES (as a measure of its reliability) were all between 0.00 and 0.03, and correlations of the time interval with sample size were between 0.00 and 0.06, all non-significant. \n\nAlso, the year of publication did not correlate with any other measures. The bibliographic literature gives a reason to expect that later publications might have large samples or smaller ESs than earlier ( ). Although the corresponding correlations were in the expected direction, they did not reach significance (year/N: Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.12; year/ES: \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.08). Also, the correlation between publication year and IF was close to 0 (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.03). \n\n\n### Publication Bias \n  \nThe inverted SE (1/SE) was taken as a measure of the reliability of an ES. Across all datasets, the rank-order correlation between ES and its 1/SE was weak but significant (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22,   k  \u2009=\u2009381,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The result might be biased because different records contribute disproportionally to the whole mass of data. However, the positive correlation between the ES and its SE became even stronger when calculated for the selected subset of datasets included in the meta-analysis (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47,   k  \u2009=\u200962,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), as well as for the ESs averaged for each record (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   k  \u2009=\u200947,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004). The results are shown in Figure  . \n  \nNegative correlations between effect size (ES) and its reliability, estimated by the inverted standard error (1/SE), for all individual datasets [  (A)  : Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], datasets included in the meta-analysis [  (B)  : \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], and for mean ESs per record [  (C)  : \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004]. The regression lines are presented for illustration only, not for quantitative analysis. \n  \nNote that the first analysis (across all datasets) overestimates the contribution of the records reporting many datasets. The last analysis (across averaged ES), to the contrary, may overestimate the contribution of the records presenting few or only one dataset. Despite this contrary bias, very similar results were obtained. To sum up, these data show a trend to selective publication of strong but unreliable effects. How serious the bias is in respect of each particular predictor variable will be discussed below. \n\n\n### UWS and MCS \n  \nThirteen of the 381 datasets included only MCS samples, 248 datasets included only UWS patients, and the remaining datasets included both diagnostic groups of DoC patients. \n\nWhile the main issue of the present study was outcome prediction on the basis of neurophysiological data, we also asked the question whether the outcome can be predicted simply from the diagnosis. Many authors of the reviewed articles also asked this question and answered it negatively. However, a meta-analysis of the combined data from the records where both diagnosis and prognosis could be followed revealed that MCS patients recovered consciousness significantly more frequently than UWS patients (Figure  ): mean ES\u2009=\u20090.84, 95% CI from 0.61 to 1.06. On the other hand, if the positive outcome of UWS patients is defined as any minimal improvement, i.e., the transition to the MCS, the diagnosis loses its predictory value (Figure  ). \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from the diagnosis. The criterion of improvement for all patients was recovery of full consciousness.   Q  , the corresponding   p  -value and   I   are estimates of between-study heterogeneity; symbols \u25a0 stay for the estimates of effect size (ES) in each single study, with the size of the symbol being proportional to the precision of the estimate. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals of ES. The diamond \u2666 is the estimate of the overall effect, the edges of the diamond represent the 95% confidence interval limits; CI, confidence interval; UWS and MCS, sample size of UWS and MCS patients in individual studies; N_UWS and N_MCS, overall sample size of the two patient groups. The resulting ES was tested for significance using   z  -criterion; the values of   z   and the corresponding   p   are given at the end of the lower left line. \n    \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from the diagnosis. The criterion of improvement was \u201cminimal improvement,\u201d that is for UWS patients, it was the transition to MCS, and for MCS patients, at least the transition to Exit-MCS. As can be seen, with this improvement criterion the diagnosis does not predict outcome. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n  \nBecause we found that the improvement criterion for UWS (transition to the MCS versus recovery of full consciousness, that is, exit-MCS) can play a role in the calculation of prediction effects, we compared weighted mean ES for the neurophysiological variables in three conditions: (i) prediction of the recovery of consciousness for MCS patients; (ii) prediction of the recovery of consciousness for UWS patients; and (iii) prediction of the transition to MCS for UWS patients. A one-way ANOVA across these three groups resulted in a highly significant effect:   F  (2,294)\u2009=\u200923.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001. The result does not change when we limit the analysis by only those datasets that will later enter the meta-analysis [  F  (2,60)\u2009=\u200919.88,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], or when we exclude all mixed datasets [  F  (2,86)\u2009=\u200912.08,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001]. Independently of the method of calculation, the mean weighted ES for the groups (i) and (ii) (i.e., different diagnoses, the same improvement criterion) were very similar and varied\u2014dependent on the selected data\u2014between 0.41 and 0.48. The mean weighted ES for the group (iii) was about three times larger (between 1.40 and 1.68) and differed significantly from both of them, although the groups (iii) and (ii) included patients with the same diagnosis and some datasets involved in these two groups might even include some of the same patients. To sum up, neurophysiological methods are significantly more successful in prediction of the transition from UWS to MCS than in prediction of the recovery of full consciousness. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Predictory Constructs \n  \nAccording to the above results, we performed the meta-analysis separately for (a) prediction of any clinical improvement (for which UWS patients means at least transition to the MCS), and (b) prediction of the recovery of full consciousness. Sixty-two datasets comprising a total of 1,919 patients were analyzed. They involved the following potential predictors:\n   \nEEG reactivity to \u201cpassive\u201d stimulation (i.e., without an active instruction). Hypothesis: stronger EEG oscillatory responses\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG entropy indices. Hypothesis: higher EEG entropy\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG dominant oscillatory activity. Hypothesis: background activity closer to the alpha frequency\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG Synek score ( ) is frequently used in the intensive care medicine for the prognosis of the outcome of acute coma. Hypothesis: higher score\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nfMRI BOLD response to passive (auditory or nociceptive) stimulation. Hypothesis: stronger response\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nResting state PET or SPECT metabolism. Hypothesis: closer to normal brain metabolism\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nN20 component of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). Hypothesis: normal N20\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nAuditory Mismatch Negativity (MMN) to a change in ongoing acoustic stimulation. Hypothesis: larger MMN\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nAuditory P300 as an index of complex processing in cortico-subcortical networks. Hypothesis: larger amplitude or shorter latency\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nSpindle activity as an index of information processing in sleep ( ). Hypothesis: presence of sleep spindles\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \n\nThe findings are summarized in Figures   and   and presented in more detail in Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material. \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from neurophysiological variables. The criterion of improvement for all patients was the recovery of consciousness. RE, random effects. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n    \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from neurophysiological variables. The criterion of improvement for UWS patients was the transition to MCS, and for MCS patients, the recovery of consciousness. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n  \nOnly oscillatory EEG responses to passive stimulation appear to be reliably related to both prognostic criteria (i.e., minimal clinical improvement and the recovery of full consciousness). The included datasets are highly homogenous and yield a highly significant mean ES of 1.45 on a sample of 99 patients. Another prediction variable that significantly predicted the recovery of consciousness was brain metabolism assessed by PET/SPECT. It attained a mean ES of 1.40 on a sample of 106 patients. The prognostic value of the MMN, P300, EEG entropy variables, and fMRI responses to passive stimulation was not significant and characterized by strong heterogeneity of the primary datasets. \n\nMore promising results have been obtained in relation to the minimal improvement criterion. In addition to the EEG reactivity, significant effects are found for the MMN and sleep spindles. Formally positive results are obtained for the SSEP component N20 and the background EEG frequency, but the data are too heterogeneous to make a conclusion. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAlthough the Section \u201cLimitation\u201d is frequently placed at the end of Discussion, we believe that particularly the discussion of meta-analytic data is useful to begin with limitations. One important limitation is that of the present work as such. As the manuscript was prepared for a special issue, we did not systematically address the authors of the original publications but relied solely on the published data including supplementary information. Although we believe that personal contact with the authors may have enhanced our knowledge, at the first step we did not use this strategy because it might have caused considerable delays. \n\nOther limitations of the meta-analysis are rather related to the limitations of the primary literature. A quantitative review can overcome some limitations of the reviewed studies, e.g., their small size (thus, it can reveal a consistent and significant effect on the basis of several inconsistent and non-significant ones), but it cannot remove the biases implied in its empirical basis. \n\nTo begin with the least, the quality of data reporting is far from the present-day standard. While Fritz et al. ( ) bristled that only 42% of empirical psychological studies report the size of their effects, in the present sample ES was mentioned only in five records (10.6%). Presenting a patient flow chart is already a standard in many fields of clinical research but fully unknown in the domain of DoC. About a half of the reviewed records neither describe inclusion and exclusion criteria nor even make a simple statement that all patients admitted to the hospital during some period were included. Thus, the concern of Kondziella et al. ( ) about possible bias in patient selection seems to be justified. \n\nThe majority of the reviewed studies employed a univariate approach, i.e., each predictor was separately compared with the target variable. Of course, this is a serious limitation because we know that the values of a regression strongly depend on the other predictor variables included or excluded in/from the equation. Thus, a neurophysiological variable (e.g., P300), which appears useless as a single predictor, might reveal its effect in a particular combination with other predictors. A few groups have recently attempted to overcome this limitation and employed a multivariate approach to outcome prediction in DoC ( ,  ). This seems to be a perspective line of research, but now the number of such records is still too low to undertake a separate meta-analysis of these data. \n\nThe negative correlation between the description of patient selection and the number of patients suggests that selection bias might be particularly strong in small-size studies. Although the sample size in prognostic studies is on average larger than in studies comparing UWS and MCS, we found, together with single case studies, 33 records with less than 20 patients, which implies that even in the case of the equal distribution at least one of the outcome groups (recovered or non-recovered) includes <10 patients. Particularly, the studies with the total   N  \u2009<\u200910 result in huge confidence intervals making any reliable conclusion impossible. Of course, small or even single case studies may have sense at the very beginning of the research process, when nothing is known about an investigated phenomenon whatsoever. However, in such a case, one can expect an increase of sample sizes with the year of publication, but this correlation was not significant. \n\nStrong negative effects of underpowered studies on the quality of the reported data have thoroughly been discussed in the literature in general ( ,  ,  ) and specifically in neuroscience ( ,  ). Positive findings of tiny studies can only result from chance or selective data report. Our data show a consistent and significant correlation between the size of a prognostic effect and its standard error, indicating that stronger effects are less reliable. The correlation even withstood the removal of all datasets with <10 patients. As these small samples yield particularly large SE, the variability of SE was severely restricted, which might be expected to reduce the correlation coefficient. This was, however, not the case (Figure  ). \n\nAnother important limitation of nearly all studies was the lack of outcome blindness. Only two groups of authors clearly indicated that the diagnosis of the outcome was performed by neurologists without the knowledge of predictor values. One might argue that the diagnosis of recovery of consciousness (based on the criteria of consistent communication and functional use of objects) is quite easy and can hardly be biased by neurophysiological data. Even if this argument is true for exit-MCS, it is obviously false for the other broadly used improvement criterion of UWS patients, namely the transition to MCS. As the differential diagnostics between UWS and MCS is notoriously difficult ( ), any information about positive or negative neurophysiological findings could influence the diagnostic decision. If this influence really takes place, we can expect much stronger correlation of neurophysiological indices with the transition to MCS than with the transition to exit-MCS, because the latter diagnosis is easier and thus less affected by additional information. \n\nExactly this was true. When the improvement criterion for both diagnostic groups (UWS and MCS) was the transition to exit-MCS, the weighted average ES (in terms of Cohen\u2019s   d  ) was rather moderate, in any case slightly smaller than 0.5. But the transition of UWS patients to MCS (which is quite difficult from the diagnostic point of view) was strongly related to the neurophysiological findings, with the weighted average ES being >1.4. \n\nA potentially strong but still underestimated bias is related to unreported predictor variables. In most of the reviewed records, outcome prediction was not the main aim of the study, but rather a by-product of other analyses. Particularly, in such studies (though not only in these), many variables could be measured but not really reported. Sometimes, many variables are used in a UWS/MCS comparison but not even mentioned in relation to prognosis, although one may suppose that they were also compared with the follow-up data. Less frequently prognostic effects are referred to as \u201clacking\u201d or \u201cnon-significant\u201d without further quantification. Simmons et al. ( ) suggest a very simple solution of the problem: whenever authors list their variables, they should add a short word \u201conly.\u201d We tried to counteract this false positive effect by assigning the value of 0 to the effects of obviously omitted variables (with its SE being assumed as the median SE of the reported variables). However, this method is not only imprecise but can also be biased, first, because the real number of such omitted variables may be much larger than a reader can guess, and second, because negative effects (i.e., those which run against the starting hypothesis, such as better neurophysiological responses in non-recovered patients) can be omitted more frequently than positive effects. \n\nWith this in mind, we understand that the data of meta-analyses should be taken with great caution. Nevertheless, we believe that a glance on the meta-analytic results can be of interest. First, the analysis was strongly complicated by the high variability of the primary records. Very small number of studies using exactly the same predictor and the same improvement criterion enforced us to combine similar methods, which resulted in high heterogeneity indices such as   I  . Poor prognostic features of the characteristics of fMRI reactivity might partially be attributed to this group of studies including fMRI responses to very different stimulations from pain to music. For the same reason, we excluded some possible predictors (e.g., responses to active behavioral instructions; ERP N400 component) that were employed in two records only. \n\nSecond, the empirical contribution of predictors does not necessarily follow their general theoretical value defined by basic neuroscience. This is quite demonstrative in the case of P300, one of the most useful and most widely employed indices in neuroscience whose effect in the prediction of the outcome turned out to be virtually 0. One might speculate that P300 is not immediately related to consciousness ( ), but, rather, to a more specific function such as working memory. Another possible reason may be the extreme difficulty of the separation between different P300 subcomponents (P3a and P3b) in the target population ( ). The subcomponents are usually distinguished by topography and responses to active instruction, but most DoC patients have changed ERP topography and do not respond to instruction. If the results of this preliminary analysis should be used to determine which lines of research should not be recommended for future studies, P300 is the first candidate for such a negative recommendation. Also, the importance of the (highly expensive) fMRI predictors might similarly be overestimated on the basis of their theoretical importance. \n\nOscillatory EEG responses to stimulation showed, to the contrary, most promising effects, which agree well with the results of Bender et al. ( ) obtained on the basis of different data. \n\nAlthough EEG reactivity was measured to very different stimuli [e.g., to passive ( ) or forced eyes opening ( ,  ), to pain ( ,  ), to warm water ( ), and no description was given by Sar\u00e0 et al. ( )] and the definition of reactivity substantially varied, the results are very homogenous across the reports. Moreover, this was the only group of predictor variables whose predictive value was significant for both improvement criteria (transition from UWS to MCS and the recovery of consciousness). Publication bias was also presented in these data, but it was less strong than for many other predictors (see Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). \n\nOther perspective variables are brain metabolism (estimated by means of PET or SPECT) and the presence of sleep spindles in the EEG. Recent sleep data indicate a vital importance of spindles in information processing during sleep, which affects numerous cognitive processes in the subsequent wakefulness ( ,  ,  ). DoC belongs to rare medical conditions characterized by severe deficits, or even complete absence, of sleep spindles, also in patients with relatively preserved sleep structure ( ,  ). We believe that the role of sleep spindles in the outcome prediction in DoC should be explored in future work. \n\nBoth MMN and SSEP are proven outcome predictors for acute coma ( ,  ). However, their value for the chronic DoC remains unclear. The present findings indicate their prognostic effects for the transition from UWS to MCS but not for recovery of consciousness. \n\nThe data further show that the predictive value of the auxiliary (e.g., neurophysiological) variables should be compared with the values of clinical variables. In the currently reviewed data, MCS patients had about 4.5 times better chances (if we take the lower limit of the 95% CI, three times better chances) to regain consciousness than UWS patients. It is true that we analyzed only records implementing the neurophysiological approach and missed similar data in the other publications not using neurophysiological variables. Nevertheless, the effect is very strong and, as far as we can judge, not strongly biased (as it was not a desired effect). This indicates the necessity to integrate neurophysiological and clinical predictors within a multivariate approach in further studies. This integration could be more productive in both diagnostic and prognostic respects than the attempts to oppose different classes of variables to each other. \n\nThese considerations can only be conceived of as preliminary. It should be stressed that all biasing factors discussed above act in the same direction, potentially increasing the number of   false positive   results. The general critique of Brok et al. ( ) remains valid also for the current study: as long as the original studies do not present all information, meta-analyses can only try to diminish, but not abolish the positive bias. If we want to eliminate the bias, (i) small-size studies should be avoided (for prediction studies, groups of recovered/non-recovered should include at least 20 patients each); (ii) a flow chart should make evident the procedure of patient selection; (iii) neurologists assessing the target variable (i.e., change of the diagnosis) should be completely blinded regardless the values of neurophysiological predictors; (iv) the full list of measured variables including all potential predictors should be presented from the beginning of a report (in a Methods section); (v) the intervals (a) between the accident and the neurophysiological measurement, and (b) between this measurement and the follow-up assessment should be specified; finally, (vi) all positive   and negative   (e.g., non-significant relationships) results should be described in the same quantitative manner, either including the size of all effects, or permitting to calculate this size (e.g., mean and SD for the recovered and non-recovered groups). \n\nTherefore, the numbers presented in Figures   and   and in the Supplementary Materials can now be regarded, not as estimates of real effects, but rather, as upper limits of these effects. The current state of affairs is yet far away from the level at which any practical recommendation can be given except the recommendation to be highly careful with interpretations. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nBoth authors performed data search and analyses.
