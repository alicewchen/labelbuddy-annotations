We aimed at revealing any systematic differences between AC surface locations of these activations by statistically analyzing the activation loci using the open-source Matlab toolbox VAMCA (Visualization and Meta-analysis on Cortical Anatomy). AC activations associated with pitch processing (e.g., active or passive listening to tones with a varying vs. fixed pitch) had median loci in the middle superior temporal gyrus (STG), lateral to Heschl's gyrus. However, median loci of activations due to the processing of infrequent pitch changes in a tone stream were centered in the STG or planum temporale (PT), significantly posterior to the median loci for other types of pitch processing. Median loci of attention-related modulations due to focused attention to pitch (e.g., attending selectively to low or high tones delivered in concurrent sequences) were, in turn, centered in the STG or superior temporal sulcus (STS), posterior to median loci for passive pitch processing. Activations due to spatial processing were centered in the posterior STG or PT, significantly posterior to pitch processing loci (processing of infrequent pitch changes excluded). In the right-hemisphere AC, the median locus of spatial attention-related modulations was in the STS, significantly inferior to the median locus for passive spatial processing. Activations associated with speech processing and those associated with voice processing had indistinguishable median loci at the border of mid-STG and mid-STS. Median loci of attention-related modulations due to attention to speech were in the same mid-STG/STS region. Thus, while attention to the pitch or location of non-speech sounds seems to recruit AC areas less involved in passive pitch or location processing, focused attention to speech predominantly enhances activations in regions that already respond to human vocalizations during passive listening. This suggests that distinct attention mechanisms might be engaged by attention to speech and attention to more elemental auditory features such as tone pitch or location.

Several paradigms have been developed to induce acute stress in fMRI settings, but it is unclear whether there is a global brain activation pattern related to psychosocial stress. To integrate the different neuronal activation patterns, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation analysis on 31 studies totaling 1279 participants. Studies used the ScanSTRESS, Montreal Imaging Stress Test, aversive viewing paradigm (AVP), Social-Evaluative Threat or Cyberball. The analysis revealed bilateral activation clusters comprising the claustrum, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. This indicates that exposure to psychosocial stress leads to activations in brain areas involved in affective processing and the endocrine stress response. Furthermore, in a systematic review, Cyberball and AVP presented themselves as outliers due to increased activation in motor areas and lack of induction of stress related activity changes, respectively. As different paradigms emphasize different dimensions of psychosocial stress such as social evaluation or performance pressure, future research is needed to identify differences between the paradigms.

The degree of increased activation in frontoparietal network was associated with behavioral performance in older adults.

As there is no general canonical approach to identifying network nodes, different identification techniques may exert different effects on inferences drawn regarding functional network properties. Here, we compared the impact of two different node identification techniques on estimates of local node importance (based on Degree Centrality, DC) in two working memory domains: verbal and visual. The two techniques compared were the commonly used Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) technique (with node locations based on data aggregation), against a hybrid technique, Experimentally Derived Estimation (EDE). In the latter, ALE was first used to isolate regions of interest; then participant-specific nodes were identified based on individual-participant local maxima. Time series were extracted at each node for each dataset and subsequently used in functional connectivity analysis to: (1) assess the impact of choice of technique on estimates of DC, and (2) assess the difference between the techniques in the ranking of nodes (based on DC) in the networks they produced. In both domains, we found a significant Technique by Node interaction, signifying that the two techniques yielded networks with different DC estimates. Moreover, for the majority of participants, node rankings were uncorrelated between the two techniques (85% for the verbal working memory task and 92% for the visual working memory task). The latter effect is direct evidence that the identification techniques produced different rankings at the level of individual participants. These results indicate that node choice in task-based fMRI data exerts downstream effects that will impact interpretation and reverse inference regarding brain function.

The cerebral underpinnings of this response have been explored in recent neuroimaging studies. We set out to test the strength of evidence for the presence of a core network of brain regions involved in male sexual arousal elicited by erotic stimuli. Eleven functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that presented erotic visual stimuli and compared the associated brain activity with the brain activity elicited by neutral visual stimuli were identified. Activation likelihood estimation was employed to perform quantitative meta-analyses on coordinates of brain activation in order to assess significant concordance across studies. The meta-analysis included studies on heterosexual males and revealed consistent activation in the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), insula, fusiform gyrus, precentral gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex across studies. Moreover, we explored brain responses associated with a physiological marker of sexual arousal (penile tumescence) and found concurrence in hypothalamus, thalamus, bilateral insula, ACC, postcentral gyrus, and occipital gyrus. This is the first quantitative meta-analysis on sexual cue reactivity and identifies a neural network consisting of cognitive (parietal cortex, ACC, thalamus, insula), emotional (amygdala, insula), motivational (precentral gyrus, parietal cortex), and physiological (hypothalamus/thalamus, insula) components constituting a core circuit of male sexual arousal in humans.

CBMA has been used in many analyses to detect where published functional MRI or voxel-based morphometry studies testing similar hypotheses report significant summary results (coordinates) consistently. Only the reported coordinates and possibly t statistics are analysed, and statistical significance of clusters is determined by coordinate density. Here a method of performing coordinate based random effect size meta-analysis and meta-regression is introduced. The algorithm (ClusterZ) analyses both coordinates and reported t statistic or Z score, standardised by the number of subjects. Statistical significance is determined not by coordinate density, but by a random effects meta-analyses of reported effects performed cluster-wise using standard statistical methods and taking account of censoring inherent in the published summary results. Type 1 error control is achieved using the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR), which is based on the false discovery rate. This controls both the family wise error rate under the null hypothesis that coordinates are randomly drawn from a standard stereotaxic space, and the proportion of significant clusters that are expected under the null. Such control is necessary to avoid propagating and even amplifying the very issues motivating the meta-analysis in the first place. ClusterZ is demonstrated on both numerically simulated data and on real data from reports of grey matter loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) and syndromes suggestive of MS, and of painful stimulus in healthy controls.

To identify in youth diagnosed as having MDD the most reliable neural abnormalities reported in existing functional neuroimaging studies and characterize their relations with specific psychological dysfunctions. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published from November 2006 through February 2015. The current analysis took place from August 21, 2014, to March 28, 2015. We retained articles that conducted a comparison of youth aged 4 to 24 years diagnosed as having MDD and age-matched healthy controls using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and a voxelwise whole-brain approach. We extracted coordinates of brain regions exhibiting differential activity in youth with MDD compared with healthy control participants. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to examine voxelwise between-group differences throughout the whole brain. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by computing null hypothesis distributions from 10\u202f000 Monte Carlo simulations and calculating the cluster size necessary to obtain the familywise error rate control at P\u2009<\u2009.05. Abnormal levels of activation in youth diagnosed as having MDD compared with control participants during a variety of affective processing and executive functioning tasks. Compared with age-matched healthy control participants (n\u2009=\u2009274), youth with MDD (n\u2009=\u2009246) showed reliable patterns of abnormal activation, including the following task-general and task-specific effects: hyperactivation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (P\u2009<\u2009.05) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (P\u2009<\u2009.05) and hypoactivation in caudate (P\u2009<\u2009.01) across aggregated tasks; hyperactivation in thalamus (P\u2009<\u2009.03) and parahippocampal gyrus (P\u2009<\u2009.003) during affective processing tasks; hypoactivation in cuneus (P\u2009<\u2009.001), dorsal cingulate cortex (P\u2009<\u2009.05), and dorsal anterior insula (P\u2009<\u2009.05) during executive functioning tasks; hypoactivity in posterior insula (P\u2009<\u2009.005) during positive valence tasks; and hyperactivity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and superior temporal cortex (P\u2009<\u2009.003) during negative valence tasks. Altered activations in several distributed brain networks may help explain the following seemingly disparate symptoms of MDD in youth: hypervigilance toward emotional stimuli from the overactivation of central hubs in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus that lead to a cascade of other symptoms; ineffective emotion regulation despite increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during affective processing, which may reverse across development or the clinical course; maladaptive rumination and poor executive control from difficulties shifting from default mode network activity to task-positive network activity during cognitively demanding tasks; and anhedonia from hypoactivation of the cuneus and posterior insula during reward processing.

A review and meta-analysis.\n\n# Keywords\n\nObesity\ncue reactivity\nfMRI\nfood cues\nmeta-analysis\n\n# Abstract\nTheoretical work suggests that obesity is related to enhanced incentive salience of food cues. However, evidence from both behavioral and neuroimaging studies on the topic is mixed. In this work we review the literature on cue reactivity in obesity and perform a preregistered meta-analysis of studies investigating effects of obesity on brain responses to passive food pictures viewing. Further, we examine whether age influences brain responses to food cues in obesity. In the meta-analysis we included 13 studies of children and adults that investigated group differences (obese vs. lean) in responses to food vs. non-food pictures viewing. While we found no significant differences in the overall meta-analysis, we show that age significantly influences brain response differences to food cues in the left insula and the left fusiform gyrus.

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of preserved consciousness in VS and MCS as revealed by fMRI and EEG, including command following (active paradigms), cortical functional connectivity elicited by external stimuli (passive paradigms) and default mode networks (resting state). Studies were selected from multiple indexing databases until February 2015 and evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. 37 studies were identified, including 1041 patients (mean age 43 years, range 16-89; male/female 2.1:1; 39.5% traumatic brain injuries). MCS patients were more likely than VS patients to follow commands during active paradigms (32% vs 14%; OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.90 to 4.27; p<0.0001)) and to show preserved functional cortical connectivity during passive paradigms (55% vs 26%; OR 3.53 (95% CI 2.49 to 4.99; p<0.0001)). Passive paradigms suggested preserved consciousness more often than active paradigms (38% vs 24%; OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.54; p<0.0001)). Data on resting state paradigms were insufficient for statistical evaluation. In conclusion, active paradigms may underestimate the degree of consciousness as compared to passive paradigms. While MCS patients show signs of preserved consciousness more frequently in both paradigms, roughly 15% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of VS are able to follow commands by modifying their brain activity. However, there remain important limitations at the single-subject level; for example, patients from both categories may show command following despite negative passive paradigms.

We conducted a systematic literature review of placebo-controlled imaging studies using OXT as a pharmacological manipulator of brain activity. We identified a total of 21 studies for inclusion in our review, and after applying additional selection criteria, 11 of them were included in our fMRI voxel-based meta-analysis. The results demonstrate consistent alterations in activation of brain regions, including the temporal lobes and insula, during the processing of social stimuli, with some variation dependent on sex and task. The meta-analysis revealed significant left insular hyperactivation after OXT administration, suggesting a potential modulation of neural circuits underlying emotional processing. This quantitative review included only a limited number of studies, thus the conclusions of our analysis should be interpreted cautiously. This limited sample size precluded a more detailed exploration of potential confounding factors, such as sex or other demographic factors, that may have affected our meta-analysis. Oxytocin has a wide range of effects over neural activity in response to social and emotional processing, which is further modulated by sex and task specificity.

Critically, convergent localization for the NFA was only evident when contrasts were appropriately controlled for task demands, and does not appear to depend on employing methods designed to overcome fMRI signal dropout in the ITG. Importantly, only five studies had foci within the identified ITG NFA cluster boundary, indicating that more empirical evidence is necessary to determine the true functional specialization and regional specificity of the putative NFA.

The present meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies used the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method in order to determine the set of regions commonly activated in space and time processing and to establish the neural activations specific to each magnitude domain. Following PRISMA guidelines, we included in the analysis a total of 112 and 114 experiments, exploring space and time processing, respectively. We clearly identified the presence of a system of brain regions commonly recruited in both space and time that includes: bilateral insula, the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the right frontal operculum and the intraparietal sulci. These regions might be the best candidates to form the core magnitude neural system. Surprisingly, along each of these regions but the insula, ALE values progressed in a cortical gradient from time to space. The SMA exhibited an anterior-posterior gradient, with space activating more-anterior regions (i.e., pre-SMA) and time activating more-posterior regions (i.e., SMA-proper). Frontal and parietal regions showed a dorsal-ventral gradient: space is mediated by dorsal frontal and parietal regions, and time recruits ventral frontal and parietal regions. Our study supports but also expands the ATOM theory. Therefore, we here re-named it the 'GradiATOM' theory (Gradient Theory of Magnitude), proposing that gradient organization can facilitate the transformations and integrations of magnitude representations by allowing space- and time-related neural populations to interact with each other over minimal distances.

In this review, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effects of BCI-robot systems. The articles published from January 2010 to December 2020 have been searched by using the databases (EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, EBSCO, Web of Science and manual search). The single-group studies were qualitatively described, and only the controlled-trial studies were included for the meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scores were pooled and the random-effects model method was used to perform the meta-analysis. The PRISMA criteria were followed in current review. A total of 897 records were identified, eight single-group studies and 11 controlled-trial studies were included in our review. The systematic analysis indicated that the BCI-robot systems had a significant improvement on motor function recovery. The meta-analysis showed there were no statistic differences between BCI-robot groups and robot groups, neither in the immediate effects nor long-term effects ( The use of BCI-robot systems has significant improvement on the motor function recovery of hemiparetic upper-limb, and there is a sustaining effect. The meta-analysis showed no statistical difference between the experimental group (BCI-robot) and the control group (robot). However, there are a few shortcomings in the experimental design of existing studies, more clinical trials need to be conducted, and the experimental design needs to be more rigorous.Implications for RehabilitationIn this review, we evaluated the clinical effects of brain-computer interface with robot on upper-limb function for post-stroke rehabilitation. After we screened the databases, 19 articles were included in this review. These articles all clinical trial research, they all used non-invasive brain-computer interfaces and upper-limb robot.We conducted the systematic review with nine articles, the result indicated that the BCI-robot system had a significant improvement on motor function recovery. Eleven articles were included for the meta-analysis, the result showed there were no statistic differences between BCI-robot groups and robot groups, neither in the immediate effects nor long-term effects.We thought the result of meta-analysis which showed no statistic difference was probably caused by the heterogenicity of clinical trial designs of these articles.We thought the BCI-robot systems are promising strategies for post-stroke rehabilitation. And we gave several suggestions for further research: (1) The experimental design should be more rigorous, and describe the experimental designs in detail, especially the control group intervention, to make the experiment replicability. (2) New evaluation criteria need to be established, more objective assessment such as biomechanical assessment, fMRI should be utilised as the primary outcome. (3) More clinical studies with larger sample size, novel external devices, and BCI systems need to be conducted to investigate the differences between BCI-robot system and other interventions. (4) Further research could shift the focus to the patients who are in subacute stage, to explore if the early BCI training can make a positive impact on cerebral cortical recovery.

Analyses of material type showed the expected dorsal-ventral dissociation between spatial and nonspatial storage in the posterior cortex, but not in the frontal cortex. Some support was found for left frontal dominance in verbal WM, but only for tasks with low executive demand. Executive demand increased right lateralization in the frontal cortex for spatial WM. Tasks requiring executive processing generally produce more dorsal frontal activations than do storage-only tasks, but not all executive processes show this pattern. Brodmann's areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex, respond most when WM must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order must be maintained. Right BAs 10 and 47, in the ventral frontal cortex, respond more frequently with demand for manipulation (including dual-task requirements or mental operations). BA 7, in the posterior parietal cortex, is involved in all types of executive function. Finally, we consider a potential fourth executive function: selective attention to features of a stimulus to be stored in WM, which leads to increased probability of activating the medial prefrontal cortex (BA 32) in storage tasks.

A majority of them were coordinate-based meta-analyses, particularly the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. A meta-evaluation of these meta-analyses was performed to qualitatively evaluate their design and reporting standards. The publications listed from the BrainMap website were screened. Six hundred and three ALE papers published during 2010-2019 were included and analysed. For reporting standards, most of the ALE papers reported their total number of Papers involved and mentioned the inclusion/exclusion criteria on Paper selection. However, most papers did not describe how data redundancy was avoided when multiple related Experiments were reported within one paper. The most prevalent repeated-measures correction methods were voxel-level FDR (54.4%) and cluster-level FWE (33.8%), with the latter quickly replacing the former since 2016. For study characteristics, sample size in terms of number of Papers included per ALE paper and number of Experiments per analysis seemed to be stable over the decade. One-fifth of the surveyed ALE papers failed to meet the recommendation of having >17 Experiments per analysis. For data sharing, most of them did not provide input and output data. In conclusion, the field has matured well in terms of rising dominance of cluster-level FWE correction, and slightly improved reporting on elimination of data redundancy and providing input data.

This study addresses this issue through a controlled meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies involving healthy participants. Various EM and SM task paradigms differ widely in the extent of default network involvement. Therefore, the issue at hand cannot be properly addressed without some control for this factor. In this regard, this study employs a two-stage analysis: a preliminary meta-analysis to select EM and SM task paradigms that recruit relatively extensive default network regions and a main analysis to compare the selected task paradigms. Based on a within-EM comparison, the default network contributed more to recollection/familiarity effects than to old/new effects, and based on a within-SM comparison, it contributed more to word/pseudoword effects than to semantic/phonological effects. According to a direct comparison of recollection/familiarity and word/pseudoword effects, each involving a range of default network regions, there were more overlaps than separations in default network subregions involved in these two effects. More specifically, overlaps included the bilateral posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, and left anteromedial prefrontal regions, whereas separations included only the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal cortex region, which was unique to recollection/familiarity effects. These results indicate that EM and SM retrieval processes involving strong memory signals recruit extensive and largely overlapping default network regions and differ mainly in distinct contributions of hippocampus and parahippocampal regions to EM retrieval.

After systematically reviewing the blood oxygenation-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) literature, and splitting studies on the basis of their task requirements, a voxel-based meta-analysis was performed to identify: (i) those regions which are replicably modulated by the uncertainty of environmental conditions; (ii) those regions whose activity is robustly affected by our subjective confidence; and (iii) those regions differentially activated at these contrasting times. In further meta-analyses the consistency of activation between these judgement types was assessed. Increased activation was consistently observed in the salience (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) and central executive network (dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices) in conditions of increased uncertainty; by contrast, default mode network (midline cortical and medial temporal lobe) regions robustly exhibited a positive relationship with subjective confidence. Regions including right parahippocampal gyrus were positively modulated by magnitude across both certainty and confidence judgements. This region was also shown to be more significantly modulated by confidence magnitude as compared with degree of environmental certainty. The functional and methodological implications of these findings are discussed with a view to improving future investigation of the neural basis of metacognitive judgement.

To further characterize such a potential common CRC activation pattern, we extended our approach to three additional questions: (i) Do CRC meta-analytic results overlap with those during the control of emotional states, such as in cognitive regulation of aversive emotions (cognitive emotion regulation, CER)? (ii) How does the control of motivational/emotional states link to the control of action states with less motivational/emotional valence such as in response inhibition paradigms, i.e., do meta-anyltic result maps overlap? (iii) Does the control of motivational/emotional states constitute a consistent pattern of organized (i.e., coherent) ongoing or intrinsic brain activity? This question was tested by a seed-based intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) analysis in an independent data set of resting-state fMRI. We found consistent CRC activation mainly in supplementary motor, dorsolateral prefrontal, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices across studies. This activation pattern overlapped largely with CER-related activation, except for left-sided lateral temporal and parietal cortex activation, which was more pronounced during CER. It overlapped partly with activation during response inhibition in (pre-)supplementary motor, insular, and parietal cortices, but differed from it in dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, it remarkably defined an iFC network covering activation patterns of both CRC and CER. Results demonstrate a consistent activation pattern of CRC across stimulus types, which overlaps largely with those of CER but only partly with those of response inhibition and constitutes an intrinsic co-activity network. These data suggest a common mechanism for the cognitive control of both motivational and emotional stimuli.

By conducting a meta-analysis on morphometric and functional imaging studies of grey matter alterations in drug-free patients, the present study aims to examine the degree of overlap between brain regions with anatomic and functional changes in patients with schizophrenia. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant publications. A multimodal analysis was then conducted using Seed-based d Mapping software. Exploratory analyses included jackknife, subgroup and meta-regression analyses. We included 15 structural MRI studies comprising 486 drug-free patients and 485 healthy controls, and 16 functional MRI studies comprising 403 drug-free patients and 428 controls in our meta-analysis. Drug-free patients were examined to reduce pharmacological effects on the imaging data. Multimodal analysis showed considerable overlap between anatomic and functional changes, mainly in frontotemporal regions, bilateral medial posterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, bilateral insula, basal ganglia and left cerebellum. There were also brain regions showing only anatomic changes in the right superior frontal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, right lingual gyrus and functional alternations involving the right angular gyrus. The methodological aspects, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous, and we cannot exclude medication effects. The present study showed overlapping anatomic and functional brain abnormalities mainly in the default mode (DMN) and auditory networks (AN) in drug-free patients with schizophrenia. However, the pattern of changes differed in these networks. Decreased grey matter was associated with decreased activation within the DMN, whereas it was associated with increased activation within the AN. These discrete patterns suggest different pathophysiological changes impacting structural and functional associations within different neural networks in patients with schizophrenia.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) allows for functional assessment of changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO), an indirect index for cortical activity. Unlike functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fNIRS is portable, relatively inexpensive, and allows subjects greater function. No systematic review or meta-analysis has drawn together the data from existing literature of fNIRS studies on the effects of experimental pain on oxyhemoglobin changes in the superficial areas of the brain. To investigate the effects of experimental pain on brain fNIRS measures in the prefrontal-cortex and the sensory-motor-area; to determine whether there is a difference in oxyhemodynamics between the prefrontal-cortex and sensory-motor-area during pain processing; to determine if there are differences in HbO between patients with centralized persistent pain and healthy controls. Studies that used fNIRS to record changes in oxyhemodynamics in prefrontal-cortex or sensory-motor-cortex in noxious and innoxious conditions were included. In total, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pain has a significantly greater effect on pre-frontal-cortex and sensory-motor areas than nonpainful stimulation on oxyhemodynamics. The effect of pain on sensory-motor areas was greater than the effect of pain on the prefrontal-cortex. There was an effect of centralized pain in the CPP group on oxyhemodynamics from a noxious stimulus compared to control's response to pain. Pain affects the prefrontal and sensory-motor cortices of the brain and can be measured using fNIRS. Implications of this study may lead to a simple and readily accessible objective measure of pain.

In contrast to this distribution of activation in children, previous work in adults found activation peaks in the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus and more left-lateralized temporal activation peaks. Accordingly, brain responses during language comprehension may shift from bilateral temporal and left pars triangularis peaks in childhood to left temporal and pars opercularis peaks in adulthood. This shift could be related to the gradually increasing sensitivity of the developing brain to syntactic information.

To review the existing evidence systematically, we performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies investigating upper limb movement-related brain activity after stroke. Twenty-four studies using sensorimotor tasks in standardized coordinates were included, totaling 255 patients and 145 healthy controls. Across the entire brain, we compared task-related activity patterns in good and poor recovery and assessed the magnitude of spatial shifts in sensorimotor activity in cortical motor areas after stroke. When compared with healthy controls, patients showed higher activation likelihood estimation values in contralesional primary motor soon after stroke that abated with time, but were not related to motor outcome. The observed activity changes were consistent with restoration of typical interhemispheric balance. In contrast, activation likelihood estimation values in ipsilesional medial-premotor and primary motor cortex were associated with good outcome, reorganization that may reflect vicarious processes associated with ventral activity shifts from BA4a to 4p. In the anterior cerebellum, a novel finding was the association of poor recovery with increased vermal activity, possibly reflecting behaviorally inadequate compensatory strategies engaging the fastigio-thalamo-cortical and corticoreticulospinal systems. Activity in ipsilesional primary motor and medial-premotor cortices in chronic stroke signals good motor recovery, whereas cerebellar vermis activity signals poor recovery. Functional MRI may be useful in identifying recovery biomarkers.

Neuroimaging techniques are contributing to clarify its neurobiological underpinnings. Here, we explored whether structural brain abnormalities might accompany altered brain activations in obesity. We combined and compared data from brain activation studies for food stimuli and the data reported in structural voxel-based morphometry studies. We found that obese individuals have reduced grey matter density and functional activations in the thalamus and midbrain. A functional connectivity analysis based on these two clusters and its quantitative decoding showed that these regions are part of the reward system functional brain network. Moreover, we found specific grey matter hypo-densities in prefrontal cortex for the obese subjects, regions involved in controlled behaviour. These results support theories of obesity that point to reduced bottom-up reward processes (i.e., the Reward Deficit Theory), but also top-down theories postulating a deficit in cognitive control (i.e., the Inhibitory Control Deficit Theory). The same results also warrant a more systematic exploration of obesity whereby the reward of food and the intentional control over consummatory behaviour is manipulated.

Many techniques exist for localizing the SOZ, including intracranial electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and stereoelectroencephalography. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in conjunction with independent component analysis (ICA) has been utilized for presurgical planning of SOZ resection, with varying results. In this meta-analysis, we analyze the current role of rs-fMRI in identifying the SOZ for presurgical planning for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate its current effectiveness compared to other methods of SOZ localization. A literature review was conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases up to May of 2020. A total of 253 articles were screened, and seven studies were chosen for analysis. Each study was analyzed for SOZ localization by ground truth, SOZ localization by rs-fMRI with ICA, principal component analysis, or intrinsic connectivity contrast, and outcomes of surgery. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze how ground truth compares to rs-fMRI in SOZ localization. The odds ratio comparing ground truth to rs-fMRI was 2.63 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-10.56). Average concordance of rs-fMRI SOZ localization compared with ground truth localization across studies was 71.3%. In the hunt for less invasive presurgical planning for epilepsy surgery, rs-fMRI with ICA provides a promising avenue for future standard practice. Our preliminary results show no significant difference in surgical outcomes between traditional standards of SOZ localization and rs-fMRI with ICA. We believe that rs-fMRI could be a step forward in this search. Further investigation comparing rs-fMRI to traditional methods of SOZ localization should be conducted, with the hope of moving toward relying solely on noninvasive screening methods.

Numerous neuroimaging studies have recently examined how antidepressants influence emotional processes. However, both clinical trials and neuroimaging studies have reported inconsistent responses to antidepressants. Moreover, the neuropsychological mechanisms by which antidepressants act to improve depressive features remain underspecified. This systematic meta-analysis summarizes pharmacological neuroimaging studies (before February 2013) and the antidepressant effects on human brain activity underlying emotional processes. Sixty fMRI studies (involving 1569 subjects) applying antidepressants vs control were included in the current quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Pooling of results by ALE meta-analyses was stratified for population (mood disorder patients/healthy volunteers), emotional valence (positive/negative emotions) and treatment effects (increased/decreased brain activity). For both patients and healthy volunteers, the medial prefrontal and core limbic parts of the emotional network (for example, anterior cingulate, amygdala and thalamus) were increased in response to positive emotions but decreased to negative emotions by repeated antidepressant administration. Moreover, selective antidepressant effects were uncovered in patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. Antidepressants increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC), a key region mediating emotion regulation, during both negative and positive emotions in patients. Repeated antidepressant administration decreased brain responses to positive emotions in the nucleus accumbens, putamen, medial prefrontal and midbrain in healthy volunteers. Antidepressants act to normalize abnormal neural responses in depressed patients by increasing brain activity to positive stimuli and decreasing activity to negative stimuli in the emotional network, and increasing engagement of the regulatory mechanism in dlPFC.

The environmental space showed stronger activation than the vista space in the occipital and frontal regions. No brain region exhibited stronger activation for the vista than the environmental space. The allocentric and egocentric reference frames activated the bilateral PPA and right RSC. The allocentric frame showed more stronger activations than the egocentric frame in the right culmen, left middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus. No brain region displayed stronger activation for the egocentric than the allocentric navigation. Our findings suggest that navigation in different spatial scale spaces can evoke specific and common brain regions, and that the brain regions representing spatial reference frames are not absolutely separated.

Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses were performed on foci from studies of delay discounting (DD = 449), working memory (WM = 452), finger tapping (finger tapping = 450), and response inhibition (RI = 450). Activity maps from relatively less (finger tapping) and more (RI) demanding executive tasks were contrasted with maps of DD and WM. Overlap analysis identified unique functional coincidence between DD and WM. The anterior cingulate cortex was engaged by all tasks. Finger tapping largely engaged motor-related brain areas. In addition to motor-related areas, RI engaged frontal brain regions. The right lateral prefrontal cortex was engaged by RI, DD, and WM and was contrasted out of overlap maps. A functional cluster in the posterior portion of the left lateral prefrontal cortex emerged as the largest location of unique overlap between DD and WM. A portion of the left lateral prefrontal cortex is a unique location where delay discounting and working memory processes overlap in the brain. This area, therefore, represents a therapeutic target for improving behaviors that rely on the integration of the recent past with the foreseeable future.

A top-down modulation of the network was exerted by the MR tasks instructions with a bilateral (preferentially sensorimotor left) network for motor imagery- vs. non-motor imagery-based MR instructions and the latter activating a preferentially posterior right occipito-temporal-parietal network.

Neuroimaging based models generally agree that limbic regions work with medial prefrontal and temporal regions during moral processing to integrate emotional, social, and cognitive elements into decision-making. However, no quantitative work has been done examining neural response across types of moral cognition tasks. This paper uses Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) to conduct neuroimaging meta-analyses of the moral cognitive literature. MKDA replicated previous findings of the neural correlates of moral cognition: the left amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Random forest algorithms classified neural features as belonging to simple/utilitarian moral dilemmas, explicit/implicit moral tasks, and word/picture moral stimuli tasks; in combination with univariate contrast analyses, these results indicated a distinct pattern of processing for each of the members of these paradigm pairs. Overall, the results emphasize that the task selected for use in a moral cognition neuroimaging study is vital for the elicitation and interpretation of results. It also replicates and re-establishes the neural basis for moral processing, especially important in light of implementation errors in previous meta-analysis.

There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of behaviorally based cognitive training programs, although the neural basis of these benefits is unclear. To address this, we reviewed all published studies that have used neuroimaging to measure neural changes following cognitive training in schizophrenia to identify brain regions most consistently affected. We searched PubMed for all neuroimaging studies examining cognitive training in schizophrenia published until December 2018. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to examine whether any brain regions showed consistent effects across studies. In total, 31 original neuroimaging studies of cognitive training were retrieved. Of these studies, 16 were functional neuroimaging studies, and 15 of these studies reported increased neural activation following cognitive training, with increased left prefrontal activation being the most frequently observed finding. However, activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis did not reveal any specific brain regions showing consistent effects across studies but rather suggested a broader, more distributed pattern of effects resulting from the interventions tested. Although several studies reported increased left prefrontal cortical activation after cognitive training, the lack of statistically significant overlap of brain regions affected by training across studies suggests broad effects of training on brain activation, possibly due to the variety of training programs used.

Several fMRI studies have investigated the neural correlates of TR in one-shot and multiround versions of the investment game (IG). However, an overall characterization of the underlying neural networks remains elusive. Here, a coordinate-based meta-analysis was employed (activation likelihood estimation method, 30 articles) to investigate consistent brain activations in each of the IG stages (i.e., the trust, reciprocity and feedback stage). Results showed consistent activations in the anterior insula (AI) during trust decisions in the one-shot IG and decisions to reciprocate in the multiround IG, likely related to representations of aversive feelings. Moreover, decisions to reciprocate also consistently engaged the intraparietal sulcus, probably involved in evaluations of the reciprocity options. On the contrary, trust decisions in the multiround IG consistently activated the ventral striatum, likely associated with reward prediction error signals. Finally, the dorsal striatum was found consistently recruited during the feedback stage of the multiround IG, likely related to reinforcement learning. In conclusion, our results indicate different neural networks underlying trust, reciprocity, and feedback learning. These findings suggest that although decisions to trust and reciprocate may elicit aversive feelings likely evoked by the uncertainty about the decision outcomes and the pressing requirements of social standards, multiple interactions allow people to build interpersonal trust for cooperation via a learning mechanism by which they arguably learn to distinguish trustworthy from untrustworthy partners.

Compared with healthy controls, all participants with addictions showed hypoactivations in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and insula and hyperactivations in the default mode network during gain anticipation; hyperactivations in the prefrontal cortex and both hyper- and hypoactivations in the striatum during loss anticipation; and hyperactivations in the occipital lobe during gain outcome. In the substance dependence subgroup, activity in the occipital lobe was increased during gain anticipation but decreased during loss anticipation. We were unable to conduct meta-analyses in the gambling addiction subgroup because of a limited data set. We did not investigate the effects of clinical variables because of limited information. The current study identified altered brain activity associated with higher- and lower-level function during gain and loss processing for non-addiction (mainly monetary) stimuli in adults with substance dependence and gambling addiction. Adults with addiction were more sensitive to anticipatory gains than losses at higher- and lower-level brain areas. These results may help us to better understand the pathology of gain and loss processing in addiction.

Humans process and evaluate these two dimensions very quickly due to their great adaptive importance. Trustworthiness evaluation is crucial for modulating behavior toward strangers; attractiveness evaluation is a crucial factor for mate selection, possibly providing cues for reproductive success. As both dimensions rapidly guide social behavior, this study tests the hypothesis that both judgments may be subserved by overlapping brain networks. To this end, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies pertaining to facial judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness. Throughout combined, individual, and conjunction analyses on those two facial judgments, we observed consistent maxima in the amygdala which corroborates our initial hypothesis. This finding supports the contemporary paradigm shift extending the amygdala's role from dominantly processing negative emotional stimuli to processing socially relevant ones. We speculate that the amygdala filters sensory information with evolutionarily conserved relevance. Our data suggest that such a role includes not only \"fight-or-flight\" decisions but also social behaviors with longer term pay-off schedules, e.g., trustworthiness and attractiveness evaluation.

We performed a series of meta-analyses on imaging studies to delineate the regions associated with consummatory and anticipatory pleasure dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Nineteen functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography studies using whole brain analysis were identified through a literature search (PubMed and EBSCO; January 1990-February 2014). Activation likelihood estimation was performed using the GingerALE software. The clusters identified were obtained after controlling for the false discovery rate at p<0.05 and applying a minimum cluster size of 200 mm(3). It was found that schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased activation mainly in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), the right parahippocampus/amygala, and other limbic regions (e.g., the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, the putamen, and the medial globus pallidus) when consummating pleasure. Task instructions (feeling vs. stimuli) were differentially related to medial prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia. When patients anticipated pleasure, reduced activation in the left putamen was observed, despite the limited number of studies. Our findings suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and limbic regions may play an important role in neural dysfunction underlying deficits in consummatory pleasure in schizophrenia.

Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a \"mega-analysis\", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at sigma=15 mm, KDA at rho=25-30 mm and MKDA at rho=15 mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors.

However, results from functional neuroimaging studies using negative emotional stimuli have failed to confirm this assumption. One of the potential reasons for the lack of effect is that study participants with psychosis may display aberrant brain responses to neutral material rather than to threatening stimuli. The authors conducted a functional neuroimaging meta-analysis to test this hypothesis. A literature search was performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase to identify functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to neutral material in patients with psychosis. A total of 23 studies involving schizophrenia patients were retrieved. Using t-maps of peak coordinates to calculate effect sizes, a random-effects model meta-analysis was performed with the anisotropic effect-size version of Seed-based d Mapping software. In schizophrenia patients relative to healthy control subjects, increased activations were observed in the left and right amygdala and parahippocampus and the left putamen, hippocampus, and insula in response to neutral stimuli. Given that several limbic regions were found to be more activated in schizophrenia patients than in control subjects, the results of this meta-analysis strongly suggest that these patients confer aberrant emotional significance to nonthreatening stimuli. In theory, this abnormal brain reactivity may fuel delusional thoughts. Studies are needed in individuals at risk of psychosis to determine whether aberrant limbic reactivity to neutral stimuli is an early neurofunctional marker of psychosis vulnerability.

In an effort to interpret these findings from a network perspective, we carried out a meta-analysis of this literature, mapping anatomical locations of under- and over-activation to the topology of a normative human functional connectome. We included 314 task-based functional neuroimaging studies including more than 5000 patients with schizophrenia and over 5000 controls. Coordinates of significant under- or over-activations in patients relative to controls were mapped to nodes of a normative connectome defined by a prior meta-analysis of 1641 functional neuroimaging studies of task-related activation in healthy volunteers. Under-activations and over-activations were reported in a wide diversity of brain regions. Both under- and over-activations were significantly more likely to be located in hub nodes that constitute the \"rich club\" or core of the normative connectome. In a subset of 121 studies that reported both under- and over-activations in the same patients, we found that, in network terms, these abnormalities were located in close topological proximity to each other. Under-activation in a peripheral node was more frequently associated specifically with over-activation of core nodes than with over-activation of another peripheral node. Although schizophrenia is associated with altered brain functional activation in a wide variety of regions, abnormal responses are concentrated in hubs of the normative connectome. Task-specific under-activation in schizophrenia is accompanied by over-activation of topologically central, less functionally specialized network nodes, which may represent a compensatory response.

Based on over 200 fMRI studies, this analysis demonstrates that the mirror system - consisting of the anterior intraparietal sulcus and the premotor cortex - is engaged when one perceives articulated motions of body parts irrespective of their sensory (visual or auditory) or verbal format as well as when the perceiver executes them. This confirms the matching role of the mirror system in understanding biological action. Observation of whole-body motions and gaze engage the posterior superior temporal sulcus and most likely reflects an orientation response in line with the action or attention of the observed actor. In contrast, the mentalizing system - consisting of the temporo-parietal junction, the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus - is activated when behavior that enables inferences to be made about goals, beliefs or moral issues is presented in abstract terms (e.g., verbal stories or geometric shapes) and there is no perceivable biological motion of body parts. A striking overlap of brain activity at the temporo-parietal junction between social inferences and other, non-social observations (e.g., Posner's cuing task) suggests that this area computes the orientation or direction of the behavior in order to predict its likely end-state (or goal). No conclusions are drawn about the specific functionality of the precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex.

There seems, however, to be a transition from the mirror to the mentalizing system even when body-part motions are observed by perceivers who are consciously deliberating about the goals of others and their behavioral executions, such as when perceived body motions are contextually inconsistent, implausible or pretended.

Investigations of neural consequences of maltreatment have focused on the amygdala. However, developmental neuroscience indicates that other brain regions are also likely to be affected by child maltreatment, particularly in the social information processing network (SIPN). We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis to: confirm that maltreatment is related to greater bilateral amygdala activation in a large sample that was pooled across studies; investigate other SIPN structures that are likely candidates for altered function; and conduct a data-driven examination to identify additional regions that show altered activation in maltreated children, teens, and adults. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation analysis with 1,733 participants across 20 studies of emotion processing in maltreated individuals. Maltreatment is associated with increased bilateral amygdala activation to emotional faces. One SIPN structure is altered: superior temporal gyrus, of the detection node, is hyperactive in maltreated individuals. The results of the whole-brain corrected analysis also show hyperactivation of the parahippocampal gyrus and insula in maltreated individuals. The meta-analysis confirms that maltreatment is related to increased bilateral amygdala reactivity and also shows that maltreatment affects multiple additional structures in the brain that have received little attention in the literature. Thus, although the majority of studies examining maltreatment and brain function have focused on the amygdala, these findings indicate that the neural consequences of child maltreatment involve a broader network of structures.

To address this issue, this study provides a direct, meta-analytic comparison of functional neuroimaging studies involving EM and IM tasks. The meta-analysis comprised two separate meta-analytic comparisons. First, to compare EM and IM in terms of encoding activity, subsequent memory effects (remembered\u202f>\u202fforgotten) and repetition suppression effects (first\u202f>\u202frepeated) were directly compared. Second, to compare EM and IM in terms of retrieval activity, retrieval success effects (hit\u202f>\u202fcorrect rejection) and repetition suppression effects were directly compared. Based on the notion that reduced activity during repeated processing is a 'by-product' or direct consequence of the stimulus processing performed in the same regions at initial exposure, regions showing repetition suppression were thought to play an important role in both IM-encoding and IM-retrieval activities. The results indicated that subsequent memory and repetition suppression effects had extensive overlaps and no significant separations, suggesting that EM- and IM-encoding activities involve largely common regions. Retrieval success and repetition suppression effects had strong segregations and only modest overlaps, suggesting that EM- and IM-retrieval activities involve largely separate regions. Consistent with these results, Explicit/Implicit Memory Encoding and Retrieval (EIMER), a neurocognitive model of EM and IM that suggests a common-encoding, separate-retrieval hypothesis for EM and IM is proposed herein.

Paediatric OCD, with its high familiality, is often referred to as a distinct OCD subtype that coincides with a developmental period in which the prefrontal cortex exhibits extensive structural and functional maturation. In the present review, we included all studies examining cognitive brain activation in children and/or adolescents with OCD. We conducted extensive literature searches for relevant articles (Pubmed, ScienceDirect) and summarize, tabulate, and discuss their results. For the eight activation studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we also performed preliminary meta-analyses to assess the most consistent hypo- and hyperactivation in paediatric OCD patients during cognitive task performance. The review of literature as well as our preliminary meta-analyses of paediatric studies indicated altered functional activation in the same brain regions of affective and cognitive cortico-striatal-thalamic (CST) circuits as for adult OCD patients despite some variations in the direction of activation difference. The still small number of studies that examined brain activation in paediatric OCD patients thereby largely converged with previous findings in adult patients and with the established neurobiological models of CST circuit dysfunction in OCD.

Although extensive research has been conducted to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) underlying these unique impairments, previous models are heterogeneous and may be further clarified based on their structural connectivity, which has been far less described. The goal of this research is to propose an anatomically concise network model for the neurophysiologic basis of IMA, specific to the voluntary pantomime, imitation and tool execution, based on intrinsic white matter connectivity. We utilized meta-analytic software to identify relevant ROIs in ideomotor apraxia as reported in the literature based on functional neuroimaging data with healthy participants. After generating an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of relevant ROIs, cortical parcellations overlapping the ALE were used to construct an anatomically precise model of anatomic substrates using the parcellation scheme outlined by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Deterministic tractography was then performed on 25 randomly selected, healthy HCP subjects to determine the structural connectivity underlying the identified ROIs. 10 task-based fMRI studies met our inclusion criteria and the ALE analysis demonstrated 6 ROIs to constitute the IMA network: SCEF, FOP4, MIP, AIP, 7AL, and 7PC. These parcellations represent a fronto-parietal network consisting mainly of intra-parietal, U-shaped association fibers (40%) and long-range inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) fibers (50%). These findings support previous functional models based on dual-stream motor processing. We constructed a preliminary model demonstrating the underlying structural interconnectedness of anatomic substrates involved in higher-order motor functioning which is seen impaired in IMA. Our model provides support for previous dual-stream processing frameworks discussed in the literature, but further clarification is necessary with voxel-based lesion studies of IMA to further refine these findings.

Bilateral striatum and right occipital cortex responded to both anticipation and outcome of win, and right AI to both phases of loss. Win anticipation vs. outcome engaged higher activity in bilateral AI, striatum, SMA and precentral gyrus and right thalamus, and lower activity in bilateral mOFC and posterior cingulate cortex as well as right inferior frontal and angular gyri.

Although neuroimaging studies have extensively investigated this cognitive function in adults, the neural correlates of VA in neurotypical children and adolescents remain unclear. The current meta-analysis reviewed and examined functional neuroimaging studies in paediatric populations that used behavioural tasks involving VA. The selected studies (N\u00a0=\u00a025) were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. Findings showed convergence of activation in mainly right-lateralized brain areas, including dorsomedial frontal cortex and parieto-temporal areas, and are consistent with previous literature on the neural correlates of VA.

With a larger simulation study, we argue that their simulation results with combined data sets are an artifact of their choice of examples. We provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the merger of two or more probability distributions, each characterized by the Markov equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph, to be describable by a Markov equivalence class whose edges are a union of those for the individual distributions.

Self-reference is typically reduced in schizophrenia as a disorder of the self while extensive self-attribution of, eg, negative thoughts is characteristic for major depression. However, a quantitative meta-analysis targeting the resting-state brain activity in both disorders is lacking. Here, we predict primarily abnormal resting-state activity in brain regions related to self-referential processing. By means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) on functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies, we investigated concurrence of hyperactivation and hypoactivation in resting-state measurements of schizophrenic and depressed patients compared with healthy controls. We found hypoactivation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, lower precueus and the precuneus, and hyperactivation in bilateral lingual gyrus of schizophrenic patients. In major depression, we found hyperactivation in vmPFC, left ventral striatum, and left thalamus and hypoactivation in left postcentral gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and left insula. An overall ALE analysis confirmed the proximity of hypoactivation in schizophrenia and hyperactivation in major depression in the vmPFC.The opposing resting-state activity in vmPFC for the 2 disorders is in line with the different expression of dysfunctional self-reference as core characteristics of schizophrenia and major depression. The vmPFC has previously been identified as a crucial area for self-referential processing and may represent a target to increase the diagnostic validity of resting-state activity for disorders with dysfunctions of the self.

However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of reward processing have yielded mixed results. To examine whether individuals with ASD process rewarding stimuli differently than typically developing individuals (controls), whether differences are limited to social rewards, and whether contradictory findings in the literature might be due to sample characteristics. Articles were identified in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO from database inception until June 1, 2017. Functional MRI data from these articles were provided by most authors. Publications were included that provided brain activation contrasts between a sample with ASD and controls on a reward task, determined by multiple reviewer consensus. When fMRI data were not provided by authors, multiple reviewers extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes from articles to recreate statistical maps using seed-based d mapping software. Random-effects meta-analyses of responses to social, nonsocial, and restricted interest stimuli, as well as all of these domains together, were performed. Secondary analyses included meta-analyses of wanting and liking, meta-regression with age, and correlations with ASD severity. All procedures were conducted in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Brain activation differences between groups with ASD and typically developing controls while processing rewards. All analyses except the domain-general meta-analysis were planned before data collection. The meta-analysis included 13 studies (30 total fMRI contrasts) from 259 individuals with ASD and 246 controls. Autism spectrum disorder was associated with aberrant processing of both social and nonsocial rewards in striatal regions and increased activation in response to restricted interests (social reward, caudate cluster: d\u2009=\u2009-0.25 [95% CI, -0.41 to -0.08]; nonsocial reward, caudate and anterior cingulate cluster: d\u2009=\u2009-0.22 [95% CI, -0.42 to -0.02]; restricted interests, caudate and nucleus accumbens cluster: d\u2009=\u20090.42 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.78]). Individuals with ASD show atypical processing of social and nonsocial rewards. Findings support a broader interpretation of the social motivation hypothesis of ASD whereby general atypical reward processing encompasses social reward, nonsocial reward, and perhaps restricted interests. This meta-analysis also suggests that prior mixed results could be driven by sample age differences, warranting further study of the developmental trajectory for reward processing in ASD.

The final meta-analysis included 23 eligible trials with 27 data sets. Compared with the healthy control group, when neuroimaging studies were combined with ReHo, ICA, and DC measurements, the brain activity of the right Rolandic operculum, right supramarginal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus in T2DM patients decreased significantly. When neuroimaging studies were combined with ALFF and CBF measurements, there was no clear evidence of differences in the brain function between T2DM and HCs.

An alternative approach is to characterize sounds with respect to their amount of variation in the time and frequency domains (i.e., spectral and temporal complexity). Although the vast majority of published studies examine contrasts between discrete sound categories, an alternative complexity-based taxonomy can be evaluated through meta-analysis. In a quantitative meta-analysis of 58 auditory neuroimaging studies, we examined the evidence supporting current models of functional specialization for auditory processing using grouping criteria based on either categories or spectro-temporal complexity. Consistent with current models, analyses based on typical sound categories revealed hierarchical auditory organization and left-lateralized responses to speech sounds, with high speech sensitivity in the left anterior superior temporal cortex. Classification of contrasts based on spectro-temporal complexity, on the other hand, revealed a striking within-hemisphere dissociation in which caudo-lateral temporal regions in auditory cortex showed greater sensitivity to spectral changes, while anterior superior temporal cortical areas were more sensitive to temporal variation, consistent with recent findings in animal models. The meta-analysis thus suggests that spectro-temporal acoustic complexity represents a useful alternative taxonomy to investigate the functional organization of human auditory cortex.

To confirm the AES-SDM meta-analysis results, we conducted two meta-analyses: activation likelihood estimation (ALE) and multi-level kernel density analysis (MKDA). We found that migraine showed increased regional neural activities in the bilateral postcentral gyrus (PoCG), left hippocampus (HIP.L), right pons, left superior frontal gyrus (SFG.L), triangular part of right inferior frontal gyrus (IFGtriang.R), right middle frontal gyrus (MFG.R), and left precentral gyrus (PreCG.L) and decreased regional intrinsic brain activities were exhibited in the right angular gyrus (ANG.R), left superior occipital gyrus (SOG.L), right lingual gyrus (LING.R). Moreover, the meta-analysis of ALE further validated the abnormal neural activities in the PoCG, right pons, ANG.R, and HIP. Meta-regression demonstrated that headache intensity was positively associated with the abnormal activities in the HIP.L, ANG.R, and LING.R. These findings suggest that migraine is associated with abnormal spontaneous brain activities of some pain-related regions, which may contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanism of migraine.

The increase in the number of neuroimaging studies has greatly expanded our knowledge of the neural bases of facial emotion processing in both conditions. However, to date, SAD and WS have not been compared. We conducted a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comparing SAD and WS cases to healthy control participants (HC) using facial emotion processing paradigms. Two researchers conducted comprehensive PubMed/Medline searches to identify all fMRI studies of facial emotion processing in SAD and WS. The following search key-words were used: \"emotion processing\"; \"facial emotion\"; \"social anxiety\"; \"social phobia\"; \"Williams syndrome\"; \"neuroimaging\"; \"functional magnetic resonance\"; \"fMRI\" and their combinations, as well as terms specifying individual facial emotions. We extracted spatial coordinates from each study and conducted two separate voxel-wise activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses, one for SAD and one for WS. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 studies of SAD and five of WS. We found evidence for both common and distinct patterns of neural activation. Limbic engagement was common to SAD and WS during facial emotion processing, although we observed opposite patterns of activation for each disorder. Compared to HC, SAD cases showed hyperactivation of the amygdala, the parahippocampal gyrus and the globus pallidus. Compared to controls, participants with WS showed hypoactivation of these regions. Differential activation in a number of regions specific to either condition was also identified: SAD cases exhibited greater activation of the insula, putamen, the superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal regions and the cuneus, while WS subjects showed decreased activation in the inferior region of the parietal lobule. The identification of limbic structures as a shared correlate and the patterns of activation observed for each condition may reflect the aberrant patterns of facial emotion processing that the two conditions share, and may contribute to explaining part of the underlying neural substrate of exaggerated/diminished fear responses to social cues that characterize SAD and WS respectively. We believe that insights from WS and the inclusion of this syndrome as a control group in future experimental studies may improve our understanding of the neural correlates of social fear in general, and of SAD in particular.

Localization within the frontal cortex, however, varies across studies and appears dependent on the nature of the task. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis is a powerful quantitative method of establishing concurrence of activation across functional neuroimaging studies. For this study, ALE was used to investigate concurrent neural correlates of successfully inhibited No-go stimuli across studies of healthy adults performing a Go/No-go task, a paradigm frequently used to measure response inhibition. Due to the potential overlap of neural circuits for response selection and response inhibition, the analysis included only event-related studies contrasting No-go activation with baseline, which allowed for inclusion of all regions that may be critical to visually guided motor response inhibition, including those involved in response selection. These Go/No-go studies were then divided into two groups: \"simple\" Go/No-go tasks in which the No-go stimulus was always the same, and \"complex\" Go/No-go tasks, in which the No-go stimulus changed depending on context, requiring frequent updating of stimulus-response associations in working memory. The simple and complex tasks demonstrated distinct patterns of concurrence, with right dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal circuits recruited under conditions of increased working memory demand. Common to both simple and complex Go/No-go tasks was concurrence in the pre-SMA and the left fusiform gyrus. As the pre-SMA has also been shown to be involved in response selection, the results support the notion that the pre-SMA is critical for selection of appropriate behavior, whether selecting to execute an appropriate response or selecting to inhibit an inappropriate response.

This issue has been largely neglected in the literature on blindness, despite difficulties in social interactions may be particular salient in the life of blind individuals (especially children). Here we provide a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies reporting brain activations associated to the representation of self and others' in early blind individuals and in sighted controls. Our results indicate that early blindness does not critically impact on the development of the \"social brain,\" with social tasks performed on the basis of auditory or tactile information driving consistent activations in nodes of the action observation network, typically active during actual observation of others in sighted individuals. Interestingly though, activations along this network appeared more left-lateralized in the blind than in sighted participants. These results may have important implications for the development of specific training programs to improve social skills in blind children and young adults.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published up to 30 April 2012 investigating facial affect processing in patients with SZ or BD were identified through computerized and manual literature searches. Activation foci from 29 studies encompassing 483 healthy individuals, 268 patients with SZ and 267 patients with BD were subjected to voxel-based quantitative meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Compared to healthy individuals, when emotional facial stimuli were contrasted to neutral stimuli, patients with BD showed overactivation within the parahippocampus/amygdala and thalamus and reduced engagement within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas patients with SZ showed underactivation throughout the entire facial affect processing network and increased activation in visual processing regions within the cuneus. Patients with BD showed greater thalamic engagement compared to patients with SZ; in the reverse comparison, patients with SZ showed greater engagement in posterior associative visual cortices. During facial affect processing, patients with BD show overactivation in subcortical regions and underactivation in prefrontal regions of the facial affect processing network, consistent with the notion of reduced emotional regulation.

The putative involvement of oxytocin, in this regard, has been deeply investigated. Performing a voxel-based meta-analysis, we aimed at testing the hypothesis of overlapping brain activation in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the mother-infant interaction and the oxytocin modulation of emotional stimuli in humans. We performed two systematic literature searches: fMRI studies investigating the neurofunctional correlates of the 'maternal brain' by employing mother-infant paradigms; and fMRI studies employing oxytocin during emotional tasks. A unimodal voxel-based meta-analysis was performed on each database, whereas a multimodal voxel-based meta-analytical tool was adopted to assess the hypothesis that the neurofunctional effects of oxytocin are detected in brain areas implicated in the 'maternal brain.' We found greater activation in the bilateral insula extending to the inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia and thalamus during mother-infant interaction and greater left insular activation associated with oxytocin administration versus placebo. Left insula extending to basal ganglia and frontotemporal gyri as well as bilateral thalamus and amygdala showed consistent activation across the two paradigms.

To localize human brain structures associated with the experience of humor, we conducted quantitative activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta analyses of 57 fMRI studies (n\u00a0=\u00a01248) reporting enhanced regional brain activity evoked by humorous cues versus matched control cues. We performed separate ALE analyses of studies that employed picture-driven, text-based, and auditory laughter cues to evoke humor. A primary finding was that complex humor activates supramodal areas of the brain strongly associated with emotional processes, including bilateral amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus. Moreover, activation in brain regions associated with language, semantic knowledge, and theory of mind were differentially modulated by text and picture-driven humor cues, while hearing laughter enhances activation in auditory association cortex. The identification of humor-driven brain networks has the potential to expand brain-derived models of human emotion and could provide useful targets in translational research and therapy.

Advances in functional neuroimaging have made it possible to study brain responses to acupuncture; however, previous studies have mainly concentrated on acupoint specificity. We wanted to focus on the functional brain responses that occur because of needle insertion into the body. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was carried out to investigate common characteristics of brain responses to acupuncture needle stimulation compared to tactile stimulation. A total of 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, which consisted of 51 acupuncture and 10 tactile\u00a0stimulation experiments, were selected for the meta-analysis. Following acupuncture needle stimulation, activation in the sensorimotor cortical network, including the insula, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and deactivation in the limbic-paralimbic neocortical network, including the medial prefrontal cortex, caudate, amygdala, posterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampus, were detected and assessed. Following control tactile stimulation, weaker patterns of brain responses were detected in areas similar to those stated above. The activation and deactivation patterns following acupuncture stimulation suggest that the hemodynamic responses in the brain simultaneously reflect the sensory, cognitive, and affective dimensions of pain. This article facilitates a better understanding of acupuncture needle stimulation and its effects on specific activity changes in different brain regions as well as its relationship to the multiple dimensions of pain. Future studies can build on this meta-analysis and will help to elucidate the clinically relevant therapeutic effects of acupuncture.

The present activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis capitalized on previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to determine shared neurofunctional alterations among the three disorders. Task-based fMRI studies of individuals with SUD, OCD, or IGD were obtained. ALE was performed within each disorder. Next, contrast and conjunction meta-analyses were performed to determine differential and common alterations.

Conjunction meta-analyses revealed shared alterations in the anterior insular cortex between OCD and SUDs. SUD exhibited additionally pronounced dorsal-striatal alterations compared with both, OCD and IGD. IGD shared frontal, particularly cingulate alterations with all SUDs, while IGD demonstrated pronounced temporal alterations compared with both, SUD and OCD. No robust overlap between IGD and OCD was observed. Across the disorders, neurofunctional alterations were mainly contributed by cognitive systems and positive valence RDoC domains. The present findings indicate that neurofunctional dysregulations in prefrontal regions engaged in regulatory-control represent shared neurofunctional alterations across substance and behavioral addictions, while shared neurofunctional dysregulations in the anterior insula may mediate compulsivity in substance addiction and OCD.

However, there has been little consideration of whether these changes may overlap with regions/circuits targeted by depression treatments and what the implications of this overlap would be on measuring efficacy in placebo-controlled clinical trials. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar for functional MRI and PET neuroimaging studies of placebo effects. Studies recruiting both healthy subjects and patient populations were included. Neuroimaging coordinates were extracted and included for Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. We then searched for interventional studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for depression and extracted target coordinates for comparative spatial analysis with the placebo effects maps. Of 1169 articles identified, 34 neuroimaging studies of placebo effects were included.

Since these studies focused on the regulated region(s), little is known about the target-independent mechanisms associated with neurofeedback-guided control of brain activation, i.e. the regulating network. While the specificity of the activation during self-regulation is an important factor, no study has effectively determined the network involved in self-regulation in general. In an effort to detect regions that are responsible for the act of brain regulation, we performed a post-hoc analysis of data involving different target regions based on studies from different research groups. We included twelve suitable studies that examined nine different target regions amounting to a total of 175 subjects and 899 neurofeedback runs. Data analysis included a standard first- (single subject, extracting main paradigm) and second-level (single subject, all runs) general linear model (GLM) analysis of all participants taking into account the individual timing. Subsequently, at the third level, a random effects model GLM included all subjects of all studies, resulting in an overall mixed effects model. Since four of the twelve studies had a reduced field of view (FoV), we repeated the same analysis in a subsample of eight studies that had a well-overlapping FoV to obtain a more global picture of self-regulation. The GLM analysis revealed that the anterior insula as well as the basal ganglia, notably the striatum, were consistently active during the regulation of brain activation across the studies. The anterior insula has been implicated in interoceptive awareness of the body and cognitive control. Basal ganglia are involved in procedural learning, visuomotor integration and other higher cognitive processes including motivation. The larger FoV analysis yielded additional activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporo-parietal area and the visual association areas including the temporo-occipital junction. In conclusion, we demonstrate that several key regions, such as the anterior insula and the basal ganglia, are consistently activated during self-regulation in real-time fMRI neurofeedback independent of the targeted region-of-interest. Our results imply that if the real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies target regions of this regulation network, such as the anterior insula, care should be given whether activation changes are related to successful regulation, or related to the regulation process per se. Furthermore, future research is needed to determine how activation within this regulation network is related to neurofeedback success.

Although there are some reviews of previous neuroimaging studies on appetitive behaviors, the findings on neural activation in response to pictures of high- and low-calorie foods seem inconsistent. This study aims to systematically review, integrate, and meta-analyze neuroimaging evidence of viewing high- and low-calorie foods. There were 25 samples from 24 studies, totalizing 489 normal-weight participants (311 female, 160 male, and 18 of unknown sex). We conducted a systematic review and Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on viewing high-calorie foods (versus non-foods), low-calorie foods (versus non-foods), and high- versus low-calorie foods. In systematic review, several brain regions were shown to be activated when viewing high- or low-calorie foods (versus non-foods) and viewing high- versus low-calorie foods, including the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, hippocampus, superior parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus. However, the ALE meta-analysis showed that the left orbitofrontal cortex, left amygdala, insula, superior parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus were activated when viewing high-calorie foods (versus non-foods); the left fusiform gyrus was activated when viewing low-calorie foods (versus non-foods); and no cluster was activated when viewing high- versus low-calorie foods.

Analogical reasoning has been studied using various tasks that have generally required the consideration of the relationships between objects and their integration to infer an analogy schema. However, these tasks varied in terms of the level and the nature of the relationships to consider (e.g., semantic, visuospatial). The aim of this study was to identify the cerebral network involved in analogical reasoning and its specialization based on the domains of information and task specificity. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 27 experiments that used analogical reasoning tasks. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was one of the regions most consistently activated across the studies. A comparison between semantic and visuospatial analogy tasks showed both domain-oriented regions in the inferior and middle frontal gyri and a domain-general region, the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, which was specialized for analogy tasks. A comparison of visuospatial analogy to matrix problem tasks revealed that these two relational reasoning tasks engage, at least in part, distinct right and left cerebral networks, particularly separate areas within the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings highlight several cognitive and cerebral differences between relational reasoning tasks that can allow us to make predictions about the respective roles of distinct brain regions or networks.

In the current review we examined whether there are discrete and shared neural signatures for different uncertain contexts. From the literature we identified three broad categories of uncertainty currently empirically studied using functional MRI (fMRI): basic threat and reward uncertainty, decision-making under uncertainty, and associative learning under uncertainty. We examined the neural basis of each category by using a coordinate based meta-analysis, where brain activation foci from previously published fMRI experiments were drawn together (1998-2017; 87 studies). The analyses revealed shared and discrete patterns of neural activation for uncertainty, such as the insula and amygdala, depending on the category.

Compared to healthy controls, patients with aMCI showed decreased ALFFs in the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices, bilateral frontoinsular cortices, left occipitotemporal cortex, and right supramarginal gyrus and increased ALFFs in the right lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left hippocampus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. A meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the increased severity of cognitive impairment in aMCI patients was associated with greater decreases in ALFFs in the cuneus/precuneus cortices.

We applied activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of functional neuroimaging studies probing motor function in patients with PD. The meta-analysis encompassed data from 283 patients with PD reported in 24 functional neuroimaging studies and yielded consistent alterations in neural activity in patients with PD. Differences in cortical activation between PD patients and healthy controls converged in a left-lateralized fronto-parietal network comprising the presupplementary motor area, primary motor cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and superior parietal lobule. Both, increases as well as decreases in motor cortical activity, which were related to differences in movement timing and selection in the applied motor tasks, were reported in these cortical areas. In the basal ganglia, PD patients expressed a decrease of motor activation in the posterior motor putamen, which improved with dopaminergic medication. The likelihood of detecting a decrease in putaminal activity increased with motor impairment. This reduced motor activation of the posterior putamen across previous neuroimaging studies indicates that nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation affects neural processing in the denervated striatal motor territory. In contrast, fronto-parietal motor areas display both increases as well as decreases in movement related activation. This points to a more complex relationship between altered cortical physiology and nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in PD.

Functional neuroimaging studies indicate a rich network of brain activations for empathic processing. However, previous research focused on core activations in bilateral anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate/anterior midcingulate cortex (ACC/aMCC) which are also typically present during nociceptive (pain) processing. Theoretical understanding of empathy would benefit from empirical investigation of shared and contrasting brain activations for empathic and nociceptive processing. Thirty-nine empathy for observed pain studies (1112 participants; 527 foci) were selected by systematic review. Coordinate based meta-analysis (activation likelihood estimation) was performed and novel contrast analyses compared neurobiological processing of empathy with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 180 studies of nociceptive processing (Tanasescu et\u00a0al., 2016). Conjunction analysis indicated overlapping activations for empathy and nociception in AI, aMCC, somatosensory and inferior frontal regions. Contrast analysis revealed increased likelihood of activation for empathy, relative to nociception, in bilateral supramarginal, inferior frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Nociception preferentially activated bilateral posterior insula, somatosensory cortex and aMCC. Our findings support the likelihood of shared and distinct neural networks for empathic, relative to nociceptive, processing.

Successive quantitative analyses found that internet gaming addiction and heroin dependence modulated neural activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and heroin dependence further in the right orbitofrontal cortex. Our analyses also demonstrated the expected mean effect sizes in each region when conducting cue-reactivity experiments on addictions. It appears that distinct addiction types may manifest differently in the brain and may moderate cue reactivity to a greater extent than previously suggested factors. This study underscores the need for additional research comparing the neural mechanisms underlying different addiction types. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

To clarify how acquiring motor expertise induces cortical reorganization during motor task performance, the current study conducted a quantitative meta-analysis on 26 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate motor task performance in people with long-term motor training experience (e.g., athletes, musicians, and dancers) and control participants. Meta-analysis of the brain activation in motor experts and novices showed similar effects in the bilateral frontal and parietal regions. The meta-analysis on the contrast between motor experts and novices indicated that experts showed stronger effects in the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) than did novices in motor execution and prediction tasks. In motor observation tasks, experts showed stronger effects in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9) and left precentral gyrus (BA 6) than novices. On the contrary, novices had stronger effects in the right motor areas and basal ganglia as compared with motor experts. These results indicate that motor experts have effect increases in brain areas involved in action planning and action comprehension, and suggest that intensive motor training might elaborate the motor representation related to the task performance.

In the present discussion paper, we reviewed eight functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) papers to determine whether there are sex differences in brain activity during long-term memory retrieval. The objectives were: 1) to compare the experimental parameters in studies reporting significant versus null long-term memory sex differences, and 2) to identify whether specific brain regions were associated with sex differences during long-term memory. The following experimental parameters were extracted from each paper: the number of participants, the average age of participants, stimulus type(s), whether or not performance was matched, whether or not sex differences were reported, the type of between-subject statistical test used, and the contrast(s) employed. The particular experimental parameters employed in each study did not appear to determine whether sex differences were observed, as there were sex differences in all eight studies. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was conducted to identify brain regions activated to a greater degree by females than males or males than females. This ALE meta-analysis revealed sex differences (male > female) in the lateral prefrontal cortex, visual processing regions, parahippocampal cortex, and the cerebellum. This constitutes compelling evidence that there are substantial sex differences in brain activity during long-term memory retrieval. More broadly, the present findings question the widespread practice of collapsing across sex in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

Recently, fMRI has been used to examine abnormal activation of brain regions in patients with ITN. However, sample sizes have been small in these few studies, and the abnormally activated brain regions remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we retrieved and analyzed literature on the brain areas with abnormal or reduced activation in ITN patients, with the aim of providing insight into the neuropathological basis of the disease and to provide new targets for treatment. We retrieved resting state fMRI studies on trigeminal neuralgia patients from PubMed, the Web of Science and Scopus databases until November 2022, and we extracted the coordinates of the sites with increased or decreased activation. We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify regions of abnormal activation in ITN patients. ALE meta-analysis revealed that the left caudate nucleus and right anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus are abnormally hyperactivated in ITN patients. Moreover, ITN patients showed reduced activation in the left precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus. ALE meta-analysis identified several brain regions with abnormally high or decreased activation in ITN patients. Sites with altered activation may be potential targets for non-invasive brain stimulation as adjunct therapy for ITN.

Meta-analyses were conducted using Seed-based d Mapping software. Based on a meta-analysis of 17 studies comprising 381 suicidal individuals and 642 controls, we mainly found that increased activity in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus, along with decreased activity in the right putamen and left insula, were detected in suicidal individuals compared with nonsuicidal\u00a0subjects. To reduce methodological heterogeneity between the included studies, subanalyses of behavioral domains were conducted, and the right superior temporal gyrus was found to increase in all subanalyses of domains. In subanalyses of suicidal attempters and ideators, suicide attempters displayed hyperactivation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus and blunted responses in the left insula relative to controls. Suicidal ideators demonstrated elevated activation in the right middle occipital gyrus and reduced activity in the right putamen relative to controls. The bilateral superior temporal gyrus was the most robust finding, replicable in all data sets in the jackknife sensitive analysis. Moreover, increased activity in the right superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and right middle occipital gyrus was found to be involved with higher suicide ideation scores. This study revealed several brain regions associated with suicidality. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of suicide and have important implications for suicide prevention and interventions.

The meta-analysis of 75 independent studies included a comparison of auditory and visual oddball effects and task-relevant and task-irrelevant oddball effects. The results were interpreted with reference to the model in which a large-scale dorsal frontoparietal network embodies a mechanism for orienting attention to the environment, whereas a large-scale ventral frontoparietal network supports the detection of salient, environmental changes. The meta-analysis yielded three main sets of findings. First, ventral network regions were strongly associated with oddball effects and largely common to auditory and visual modalities, indicating a supramodal \"alerting\" system. Most ventral network components were more strongly associated with task-relevant than task-irrelevant oddball effects, indicating a dynamic interplay of stimulus saliency and internal goals in stimulus-driven engagement of the network. Second, the bilateral inferior frontal junction, an anterior core of the dorsal network, was strongly associated with oddball effects, suggesting a central role in top-down attentional control. However, other dorsal network regions showed no or only modest association with oddball effects, likely reflecting active engagement during both oddball and standard stimulus processing. Finally, prominent oddball effects outside the two networks included the sensory cortex regions, likely reflecting attentive and preattentive modulation of early sensory activity, and subcortical regions involving the putamen, thalamus, and other areas, likely reflecting subcortical involvement in alerting responses.

All fMRI experiments on BD published before March 2020, as identified in a literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Emcare, Academic Search Premier, and ScienceDirect. The literature search was conducted on February 21, 2017, and March 2, 2020, and data were analyzed from January 2021 to January 2022. fMRI experiments comparing adult individuals with BD and healthy control individuals were selected if they reported whole-brain results, including a task assessing at least 1 of the domains. In total, 2320 studies were screened, and 253 full-text articles were evaluated. A total of 49 studies were included after selection procedure. Coordinates reporting significant activation differences between individuals with BD and healthy control individuals were extracted. Differences in brain region activity were tested using the activation likelihood estimation method. A whole-brain meta-analysis evaluated whether reported differences in brain activation in response to stimuli in 3 cognitive domains between individuals with BD and healthy control individuals were different. The study population included 999 individuals with BD (551 [55.2%] female) and 1027 healthy control individuals (532 [51.8%] female). Compared with healthy control individuals, individuals with BD showed amygdala and hippocampal hyperactivity and hypoactivation in the inferior frontal gyrus during emotion processing (20 studies; 324 individuals with BD and 369 healthy control individuals), hyperactivation in the orbitofrontal cortex during reward processing (9 studies; 195 individuals with BD and 213 healthy control individuals), and hyperactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex during working memory (20 studies; 530 individuals with BD and 417 healthy control individuals). Limbic hyperactivation was only found during euthymia in the emotion and reward processing domains; abnormalities in frontal cortex activity were also found in individuals with BD with mania and depression. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed evidence for activity disturbances in key brain areas involved in cognitive and emotion processing in individuals with BD. Most of the regions are part of the fronto-limbic network.

Several functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been used to investigate the structural and functional alteration in BD. Here, we aim to investigate the current fMRI findings of brain activation during emotion-regulation tasks between BD patients and healthy controls (HC). A systematic search through PubMed database for fMRI studies on bipolar patients and HC yielded 685 studies. We performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) on 21 studies for emotion regulation in BD patients and HC. Furthermore, we performed subgroup analyses for task performances in response time and accuracy between bipolar patients and HC. The total sample included 21 fMRI studies, comprising 543 BD patients, compared to 565 HC. ALE maps for emotion-related tasks showed hyperactivation in BD patients in the caudate, amygdala, precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyri, and sub-gyrus. Whereas hypoactivation was seen in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. We could not apply a correction for p-value thresholds, as it needs large number of foci. Second, functional abnormalities were investigated for adult BD patients only, as BD patients have functional differences correlated with age. Our results showed that limbic and cortical regions can represent a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and management of BD, by showing clustered brain regions of abnormal patterns of increased activation between BD patients and HC.

However, the differences in brain activity between grip type (i.e. power or precision) and pattern (i.e. dynamic or static) are not fully understood. In order to address this, we performed Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis between grip type and grip pattern using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. ALE provides a probabilistic summary of the BOLD response in hundreds of subjects, which is often beyond the scope of a single fMRI experiment. We collected data from 28 functional magnetic resonance data sets, which included a total of 398 male and female subjects. Using ALE, we analyzed the BOLD response during power, precision, static and dynamic grip in a range of forces and age in right handed healthy individuals without physical impairment, cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction using a variety of grip tools, feedback and experimental training. Power grip generates unique activation in the postcentral gyrus (areas 1 and 3b) and precision grip generates unique activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA, area 6) and precentral gyrus (area 4a). Dynamic handgrip generates unique activation in the precentral gyrus (area 4p) and SMA (area 6) and of particular interest, both dynamic and static grip share activation in the area 2 of the postcentral gyrus, an area implicated in the evolution of handgrip. According to effect size analysis, precision and dynamic grip generates stronger activity than power and static, respectively. Our study demonstrates specific differences between grip type and pattern.

Functional neuroimaging has the potential to discern patterns of functional connectivity in humans in vivo. We analyzed the functional connectivity between the cortex and the striatum in a meta-analysis of 126 published functional neuroimaging studies. We mapped the peak activations listed in each publication into stereotaxic space and used standard functional imaging statistical methods to determine which cortical areas were most likely to coactivate with different parts of the striatum. The patterns of functional connectivity between the cortex and the different striatal nuclei are broadly consistent with the predictions of the parallel loop model. The rostrocaudal and dorsoventral patterns of corticostriatal functional connectivity are consistent with the tripartite division of the striatum into motor, associative, and limbic zones.

During the outcome stage, AUD patients exhibited reduced activation in the dorsal striatum, VS and insula, and increased activation in the orbital frontal cortex and medial temporal area.

However, the effectiveness of these techniques on depressive symptomatology is still controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Two different strings were considered for each of the two objectives of the study: A first group comprising studies patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and a second group including studies targeting depressive symptomatology reduction in other mental or medical conditions. In the first group of studies including patients with MDD, the within-group analyses yielded an effect size of Hedges' g = 0.717, while the between-group analysis an effect size of Hedges' g = 1.050. Moderator analyses indicate that treatment efficacy is only significant when accounting for experimental design, in favor of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison to non RCTs, whereas the type of neurofeedback, trial design, year of publication, number of sessions, age, sex and quality of study did not influence treatment efficacy. In the second group of studies, a small but significant effect between groups was found (Hedges' g = 0.303) in favor of bio- and neurofeedback against control groups. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by any of the sociodemographic and clinical variables. Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and neurofeedback are associated with a reduction in self-reported depression. Despite the fact that the field has still a large room for improvement in terms of research quality, the results presented in this study suggests that both modalities may become relevant complementary strategies for the treatment of MDD and depressive symptomatology in the coming years.

Heart-focused interoception has received particular attention, in part due to a readily available task for behavioural assessment, but also due to accumulating evidence for a significant role in emotional experience, decision-making and clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Improved understanding of the underlying neural correlates is important to promote development of anatomical-functional models and suitable intervention strategies. In the present meta-analysis, nine studies reporting neural activity associated with interoceptive attentiveness (i.e. focused attention to a particular interoceptive signal for a given time interval) to one's heartbeat were submitted to a multilevel kernel density analysis. The findings corroborated an extended network associated with heart-focused interoceptive attentiveness including the posterior right and left insula, right claustrum, precentral gyrus and medial frontal gyrus. Right-hemispheric dominance emphasizes non-verbal information processing with the posterior insula presumably serving as the major gateway for cardioception. Prefrontal neural activity may reflect both top-down attention deployment and processing of feed-forward cardioceptive information, possibly orchestrated via the claustrum.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'.

Numerous neuroimaging studies have found that conventionality, sentential context, and task demand can influence the involvement of the RH in metaphor processing. The current meta-analysis used foci from 17 original functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to identify what factors modulate the involvement of the RH in metaphor processing. Activation likelihood estimation was used for quantification. We focused on the contrast of metaphorical meaning processing versus literal meaning processing and calculated the meta-analysis effects when (1) metaphorical meaning is conventional, (2) metaphorical meaning is novel, (3) metaphorical and literal meaning are presented in words, (4) metaphorical and literal meaning are presented in sentential context, (5) task is valence judgment, and (6) task is semantic relatedness judgment. The results indicated that the RH only showed significant effects in metaphor processing when the metaphorical meaning is novel, when metaphorical meaning is presented in sentential context, and when the task is semantic relatedness judgment. The effects were located in right fronto-temporal regions, including inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. These results suggest that conventionality, contextual complexity, and task demand can modulate the effect of figurativeness and influence the involvement of RH in metaphor comprehension. The main role of the RH in metaphor processing is related with activating broad semantic fields and integrating concepts that may have distant semantic relations, and hence provide support for the view that the RH is responsible for processing coarse semantic information in language comprehension.

Traditional theories regarding the neurobiological substrates contributing to affective processing are shifting from regional- towards more network-based heuristic frameworks. To elucidate differential brain network involvement linked to distinct aspects of emotion processing, we applied an emergent meta-analytic clustering approach to the extensive body of affective neuroimaging results archived in the BrainMap database. Specifically, we performed hierarchical clustering on the modeled activation maps from 1,747 experiments in the affective processing domain, resulting in five meta-analytic groupings of experiments demonstrating whole-brain recruitment. Behavioral inference analyses conducted for each of these groupings suggested dissociable networks supporting: (1) visual perception within primary and associative visual cortices, (2) auditory perception within primary auditory cortices, (3) attention to emotionally salient information within insular, anterior cingulate, and subcortical regions, (4) appraisal and prediction of emotional events within medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and (5) induction of emotional responses within amygdala and fusiform gyri. These meta-analytic outcomes are consistent with a contemporary psychological model of affective processing in which emotionally salient information from perceived stimuli are integrated with previous experiences to engender a subjective affective response. This study highlights the utility of using emergent meta-analytic methods to inform and extend psychological theories and suggests that emotions are manifest as the eventual consequence of interactions between large-scale brain networks.

Contextual factors, such as longer time fasting, subjective hunger, and body mass index (BMI), may increase the likelihood of overeating. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying these moderating influences on energy intake are poorly understood. We conducted both categorical meta-analysis and meta-regression of factors modulating neural responses to sweet stimuli, using data from 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) articles incorporating 39 experiments (N\u2009=\u2009995) carried out between 2006 and 2019. Responses to sweet stimuli were associated with increased activity in regions associated with taste, sensory integration, and reward processing. These taste-evoked responses were modulated by context. Longer fasts were associated with higher posterior cerebellar, thalamic, and striatal activity. Greater self-reported hunger was associated with higher medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum, and amygdala activity and lower posterior cerebellar activity. Higher BMI was associated with higher posterior cerebellar and insular activity. Variations in fasting time, self-reported hunger, and BMI are contexts associated with differential sweet stimulus responses in regions associated with reward processing and homeostatic regulation. These results are broadly consistent with a hierarchical model of taste processing. Hunger, but not fasting or BMI, was associated with sweet stimulus-related OFC activity. Our findings extend existing models of taste processing to include posterior cerebellar regions that are associated with moderating effects of both state (fast length and self-reported hunger) and trait (BMI) variables.

Research investigating the role of OXT on functional brain changes in humans has often used task paradigms that probe socioemotional processes. Preliminary evidence suggests a central role of the amygdala in the social cognitive effects of intranasal OXT (IN-OXT), however, inconsistencies in task-design and analysis methods have led to inconclusive findings regarding a cohesive model of the neural mechanisms underlying OXT's actions. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically investigate these findings. A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases was conducted for fMRI studies which compared IN-OXT to placebo in humans. First, we systematically reviewed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of IN-OXT, including studies of healthy humans, those with clinical disorders, and studies examining resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI). Second, we employed a coordinate-based meta-analysis for task-based neuroimaging literature using activation likelihood estimation (ALE), whereby, coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences in IN-OXT versus placebo in healthy adults. Data were included for 39 fMRI studies that reported a total of 374 distinct foci. The meta-analysis identified task-related IN-OXT increases in activity within a cluster of the left superior temporal gyrus during tasks of emotion processing. These findings are important as they implicate regions beyond the amygdala in the neural effects of IN-OXT.

Aggregating neuroimaging results regarding nAChR agonists provides a means to identify common functional brain changes that may be related to procognitive drug effects. We conducted a meta-analysis of pharmacologic neuroimaging studies within the activation likelihood estimation framework. We identified published studies contrasting a nAChR drug condition versus a baseline and coded each contrast by activity change direction (decrease or increase), participant characteristics (smokers or nonsmokers), and drug manipulation employed (pharmacologic administration or cigarette smoking). When considering all studies, nAChR agonist administration was associated with activity decreases in multiple regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampus, insula, and the parietal and precentral cortices. Conversely, activity increases were observed in lateral frontoparietal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus. Exploratory analyses indicated that both smokers and nonsmokers showed activity decreases in the vmPFC and PCC, and increases in lateral frontoparietal regions. Among smokers, both pharmacologic administration and cigarette smoking were associated with activity decreases in the vmPFC, PCC, and insula and increases in the lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cuneus. These results provide support for the systems-level perspective that nAChR agonists suppress activity in default-mode network regions and enhance activity in executive control network regions in addition to reducing activation of some task-related regions. We speculate these are potential mechanisms by which nAChR agonists enhance cognition.

OCD patients showed higher activation in the right caudate body/putamen/insula and lower activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left caudate body/middle cingulate cortex (MCC), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and right lateral occipital gyrus (LOG). MACMs revealed significant co-activation between left IFG and left caudate body/MCC, left MOG and right LOG, right LOG and MTG. In the secondary meta-analyses, the washing subgroup showed higher activation in the right OFC, bilateral ACC, left MOG and right caudate body. OCD patients showed elevated dorsal striatal activation during symptom provocation. In contrast, the washing subgroup engaged higher activation in frontal, temporal and posterior cortical structures as well as right caudate body.

Cyberball, a game where a ball is virtually tossed between players, then leads to the exclusion of the research participant, is a common method used to examine the experience of social exclusion. The neural correlates of social exclusion remain a topic of debate, particularly with regards to the role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the concept of social pain. Here we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to identify brain activity reliably engaged by social exclusion during Cyberball task performance (Studies\u00a0=\u00a053; total N\u00a0=\u00a01,817 participants). Results revealed consistent recruitment in ventral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortex, inferior and superior frontal gyri, posterior insula, and occipital pole. No reliable activity was observed in dACC. Using a probabilistic atlas to define dACC, fewer than 15% of studies reported peak coordinates in dACC. Meta-analytic connectivity mapping suggests patterns of co-activation are consistent with the topography of the default network. Reverse inference for cognition associated with reliable Cyberball activity computed in Neurosynth revealed social exclusion to be associated with cognitive terms Social, Autobiographical, Mental States, and Theory of Mind. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of the default network in social exclusion and warns against interpretations of the dACC as a key region involved in the experience of social exclusion in humans.

Many task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have focused on changes in brain function in individuals with remitted MDD (rMDD).

Our meta-analysis included 13 studies, encompassing 18 experiments, 304 rMDD patients and 321 HCs. Patients with rMDD showed increased neural activation in the left inferior parietal gyrus and right fusiform gyrus and decreased neural activation in the left superior frontal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus and right Heschl gyrus. Meta-regression analysis revealed that patient age and the number of depressive episodes were negatively associated with brain activity in the left superior frontal gyrus. Our findings suggest abnormal brain function, especially in areas involved in cognitive function, emotion regulation and perception, in rMDD patients; alterations of these regions may be the primary or secondary neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MDD and provide potential neuroimaging targets for early screening.

An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of these studies was performed with GingerALE, including 16 studies. For swallowing, clusters with high activation likelihood were found in the bilateral insula, bilateral pre-central gyrus, bilateral post-central gyrus, left transverse temporal gyrus, right medial front gyrus, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral cingulate gyrus. For water swallowing, clusters with high activation likelihood were found in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and the left pre-central gyrus. For saliva swallowing, clusters with high activation likelihood were found in the bilateral cingulate gyrus, bilateral pre-central gyrus, left post-central gyrus and left transverse gyrus. This meta-analysis reflects that swallowing is regulated by both sensory and motor cortex, and saliva swallowing activates more brain areas than water swallowing, which would promote our knowledge of swallowing and provide some direction for clinical and other research.

Brain imaging studies published over the last decade, using either positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggest that multiple brain regions may play a pivotal role in this process. However, there continues to be much debate as to which areas consistently contribute to placebo analgesia-related networks. In the present study, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis, a state-of-the-art approach, to search for the cortical areas involved in PA in human experimental pain models. Nine fMRI studies and two PET studies investigating cerebral hemodynamic changes were included in the analysis. During expectation of analgesia, activated foci were found in the left anterior cingulate, right precentral, and lateral prefrontal cortex and in the left periaqueductal gray (PAG). During noxious stimulation, placebo-related activations were detected in the anterior cingulate and medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, in the left inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus, anterior insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, PAG, and pons; deactivations were found in the left mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal and precentral gyri, in the left anterior and right posterior insula, in the claustrum and putamen, and in the right thalamus and caudate body. Our results suggest on one hand that the modulatory cortical networks involved in PA largely overlap those involved in the regulation of emotional processes, on the other that brain nociceptive networks are downregulated in parallel with behavioral analgesia.

Visually similar networks are referred to by different labels, yet these same labels are used to distinguish networks within studies. We performed a literature review of fMRI studies and identified nine frequently-used labels that are used to describe topographically or functionally similar neural networks: central executive network (CEN), cognitive control network (CCN), dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (ECN), executive network (EN), frontoparietal network (FPN), working memory network (WMN), task positive network (TPN), and ventral attention network (VAN). Our aim was to meta-analytically determine consistency of network topography within and across these labels. We hypothesized finding considerable overlap in the spatial topography among the neural networks associated with these labels. An image-based meta-analysis was performed on 158 group-level statistical maps (SPMs) received from authors of 69 papers listed on PubMed. Our results indicated that there was very little consistency in the SPMs labeled with a given network name. We identified four clusters of SPMs representing four spatially distinct executive function networks. We provide recommendations regarding label nomenclature and propose that authors looking to assign labels to executive function networks adopt this template set for labeling networks.

Subgroup analyses were performed in three groups: Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE), mixed Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), and mixed Focal Epilepsy (FE) with different foci. The meta-analysis suggested commonly decreased FC in mesial prefrontal cortices across different epilepsies. Additionally decreased FC in posterior DMN was observed in IGE. The TLE showed decreased FC in temporal lobe regions and increased FC in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, an opposite finding in the ventral and dorsal middle frontal gyrus was observed in TLE. The FE demonstrated increased FC in the cuneus. The current findings revealed both common and specific alterations of FC in DMN across different epilepsies, highlighting the contribution of these dysfunctions to epileptic activities and cognitive behaviors in patients.

PVS can be hard to distinguish from a state of minimal preserved consciousness (\"minimally conscious state,\" MCS); the rate of misdiagnosis is high and has been estimated at 37-43%. In contrast, PVS is easily distinguished from brain death. We discuss the various diagnostic techniques that can be used to determine whether a patient is minimally conscious or in a persistent vegetative state. This article is based on a systematic review of pertinent literature and on a quantitative meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic methods for the minimally conscious state. We identified and evaluated 20 clinical studies involving a total of 906 patients with either PVS or MCS. The reported sensitivities and specificities of the various techniques used to diagnose MCS vary widely. The sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI-based techniques are 44% and 67%, respectively (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of 19%-72% and 55%-77%); those of quantitative EEG are 90% and 80%, respectively (95% CI, 69%-97% and 66%-90%). EEG, event-related potentials, and imaging studies can also aid in prognostication. Contrary to prior assumptions, 10% to 24% of patients in PVS can regain consciousness, sometimes years after the event, but only with marked functional impairment. The basic diagnostic evaluation for differentiating PVS from MCS consists of a standardized clinical examination. In the future, modern diagnostic techniques may help identify patients who are in a subclinical minimally conscious state.

We also examined the neural correlates underlying Cyberball, the most commonly used paradigm to study exclusion, as well as differences in exclusion-related activation between developing (7-18 years of age, from pre-adolescence up to late adolescence) and emerging adult (broadly defined as undergraduates, including late adolescence and young adulthood) samples. Results revealed involvement of the bilateral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, right precuneus and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex across the different paradigms used to examine social exclusion; similar activation patterns were identified when restricting the analysis to Cyberball studies. Investigations into age-related effects revealed that ventrolateral prefrontal activations identified in the full sample were driven by (i.e. present in) developmental samples, while medial prefrontal activations were driven by emerging adult samples. In addition, the right ventral striatum was implicated in exclusion, but only in developmental samples. Subtraction analysis revealed significantly greater activation likelihood in striatal and ventrolateral prefrontal clusters in the developmental samples as compared to emerging adults, though the opposite contrast failed to identify any significant regions. Findings integrate the knowledge accrued from functional neuroimaging studies on social exclusion to date, highlighting involvement of lateral prefrontal regions implicated in regulation and midline structures involved in social cognitive and self-evaluative processes across experimental paradigms and ages, as well as limbic structures in developing samples specifically.

Many prior fMRI studies have examined acute nociceptive pain-related brain activation in healthy participants. However, synthesizing these data to identify convergent patterns of activation can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of experimental designs and samples. To address this challenge, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of fMRI studies of stimulus-induced pain in healthy participants. Following pre-registration, two independent reviewers evaluated 4,927 abstracts returned from a search of 8 databases, with 222 fMRI experiments meeting inclusion criteria. We analyzed these experiments using Activation Likelihood Estimation with rigorous type I error control (voxel height p < 0.001, cluster p < 0.05 FWE-corrected) and found a convergent, largely bilateral pattern of pain-related activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, midcingulate cortex, and thalamus. Notably, these regions were consistently recruited regardless of stimulation technique, location of induction, and participant sex. These findings suggest a highly-conserved core set of pain-related brain areas, encouraging applications as a biomarker for novel therapeutics targeting acute nociceptive pain.

Individual studies, however, vary greatly in their findings. The authors searched for common and disorder-specific functional neurobiological deficits in several anxiety disorders. The authors also compared these deficits to the neural systems engaged during anticipatory anxiety in healthy subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and fear conditioning in healthy individuals were compared by quantitative meta-analysis. Included studies compared negative emotional processing to baseline, neutral, or positive emotion conditions. Patients with any of the three disorders consistently showed greater activity than matched comparison subjects in the amygdala and insula, structures linked to negative emotional responses. A similar pattern was observed during fear conditioning in healthy subjects. Hyperactivation in the amygdala and insula were, of interest, more frequently observed in social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than in PTSD. By contrast, only patients with PTSD showed hypoactivation in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-structures linked to the experience and regulation of emotion. This meta-analysis allowed us to synthesize often disparate findings from individual studies and thereby provide neuroimaging evidence for common brain mechanisms in anxiety disorders and normal fear. Effects unique to PTSD furthermore suggested a mechanism for the emotional dysregulation symptoms in PTSD that extend beyond an exaggerated fear response. Therefore, these findings help refine our understanding of anxiety disorders and their interrelationships.

We performed meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies examining patients with schizophrenia during the processing of auditory stimuli and in individuals experiencing hallucinations in the absence of auditory stimuli to examine whether the auditory cortex shows the paradoxical decrease/increase pattern across studies. Databases PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge were queried with the combination of the keywords \"auditory verbal hallucinations\", \"auditory hallucinations\", \"fMRI\", \"PET\", \"imaging\", yielding 11 studies involving comparison between schizophrenia and control group during external auditory stimulation, and 12 studies of hallucinating subjects experiencing AVHs and resting in the absence of auditory stimulation. The data were analyzed using Activation Likelihood Estimation method. The results showed overlapping increased activation in the absence of an external stimulus, and decreased activation in the presence of an external auditory stimulus in the left primary auditory cortex and in the right rostral prefrontal cortex, confirming the \"paradoxical\" brain activation in relation to AVHs. It is suggested that the \"paradox\" may be caused by an attentional bias towards internally generated information and failure of down- and up-regulation of the default mode and auditory processing networks, respectively, with the consequence that the spontaneous activation in the absence of an external stimulus shuts down the perceptual apparatus for further processing.

We here quantitatively summarize the published literature on cognitive emotion regulation using activation likelihood estimation in fMRI and PET (23 studies/479 subjects). In addition, we assessed the particular functional contribution of identified regions and their interactions using quantitative functional inference and meta-analytic connectivity modeling, respectively. In doing so, we developed a model for the core brain network involved in emotion regulation of emotional reactivity. According to this, the superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and (pre) supplementary motor area should be involved in execution of regulation initiated by frontal areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be related to regulation of cognitive processes such as attention, while the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may not necessarily reflect the regulatory process per se, but signals salience and therefore the need to regulate. We also identified a cluster in the anterior middle cingulate cortex as a region, which is anatomically and functionally in an ideal position to influence behavior and subcortical structures related to affect generation. Hence this area may play a central, integrative role in emotion regulation. By focusing on regions commonly active across multiple studies, this proposed model should provide important a priori information for the assessment of dysregulated emotion regulation in psychiatric disorders.

Our aim was to explore neural correlates related to theory of mind and empathy in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, in order to identify abnormal brain activation related to emotional content during mental state attribution in schizophrenia. We performed a neural-coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of existing neuroimaging data in the literature to distinguish between abnormal brain maps associated with emotional attribution and those associated with intention/belief inference. We found that brain activation in patients group was significantly decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during emotional attribution, while there was a significant decrease in the left posterior temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during intention/belief attribution. Using a meta-analytic connectivity modeling approach (MACM), we demonstrated that both regions are coactivated with other brain regions known to play a role in social cognition, including the bilateral anterior insula, right TPJ, left amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, abnormal activation in both the left TPJ and right VLPFC was previously reported in association with verbal-auditory hallucinations and a \"jumping to conclusions\" cognitive bias. Thus, these regions could be valuable targets for therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia.

Next, to evaluate the validity of the model, I formulate four multifactorial predictions aimed at three distinct types of source-memory contrast (source-hit > source-miss, source-hit > item-hit, and source-hit > correct-rejection), and test them using a meta-analytic method. The results of the meta-analyses are largely consistent with the predictions, supporting the RED. In conclusion, the RED provides an overarching framework that configures coherently with many representative findings in the literature, thereby offering a useful foundation capable of guiding further research efforts on related topics.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported effects of social environmental stress on a variety of brain regions, but interpretation of results is complicated by the variety of environmental risk factors examined and different methods employed. We examined brain regions consistently showing differences in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in individuals exposed to higher levels of environmental stress by performing a coordinate-based meta-analysis on 54 functional MRI studies using activation likelihood estimation (ALE), including an overall sample of 3044 participants. We performed separate ALE analyses on studies examining adults (mean age \u2a7e18 years) and children/adolescents (mean age <18 years) and a contrast analysis comparing the two types of study. Across both adult and children/adolescent studies, ALE meta-analysis revealed several clusters in which differences in BOLD response were associated with social environmental stress across multiple studies. These clusters incorporated several brain regions, among which the right amygdala was most frequently implicated. These findings suggest that a variety of social environmental stressors is associated with differences in the BOLD response of specific brain regions such as the right amygdala in both children/adolescents and adults.

Multilevel kernel density analysis of 24 studies (37 statistical maps; 264 coordinates; 457 participants) revealed consistent effects in the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, insula, midbrain, and brainstem, as well as prefrontal and temporal cortices. Effects in some regions were specific to particular study designs and tasks. Spatial pattern analysis revealed significant overlap of reported effects with limbic, default mode, ventral attention, and corticostriatal networks, and co-activation analyses revealed functional ensembles encompassing the prefrontal cortex, insula, and midbrain/brainstem.

However, the effect of publication bias in these fields has not been previously addressed or accounted for in the developed meta-analytic methods. In this article, we examine publication bias in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for tasks involving working memory in the frontal lobes (Brodmann Areas 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 37, 45, 46, and 47). Seventy-four studies were selected from the literature and the effect of publication bias was examined using a number of regression-based techniques. Pearson's r correlation coefficient and Cohen's d effect size estimates were computed for the activation in each study and compared to the study sample size using Egger's regression, Macaskill's regression, and the 'Trim and Fill' method.

To assess convergence of abnormal brain activation in patients with PD during the performance of tasks probing executive functions (EF). We screened the functional imaging literature on EF in PD using the PubMed database, extracted reported stereotactic data and tested for convergence of deviant neural activation in patients with PD when compared to healthy controls (HC) using a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation approach. We identified 22 eligible papers from which the main proportion was targeted at the investigation of working memory encompassing 354 patients and 306 HC. Surprisingly, no significant converging aberrant activation between HC and patients (ON, OFF or ON\u00a0+\u00a0OFF medication, respectively) could be observed when controlling for multiple comparisons using family-wise error correction on cluster-level. We conclude that there is currently not enough available evidence to pinpoint a specific neural correlate associated with executive dysfunction in PD. This might be due to the small number of studies performed and their methodical inconsistency. Therefore, it is important to conduct more research regarding functional brain changes associated with EF in these patients using more consistent frameworks and bigger samples.

We conducted a systematic, participant-level meta-analysis to test the effect of placebo treatments on pain-associated functional neuroimaging responses in the neurologic pain signature (NPS), a multivariate brain pattern tracking nociceptive pain. Medline (PubMed) was searched from inception to May 2015; the search was augmented with results from previous meta-analyses and expert recommendations. Eligible studies were original investigations that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals and that involved functional neuroimaging of the human brain with evoked pain delivered under stimulus intensity-matched placebo and control conditions. The authors of all eligible studies were contacted and asked to provide single-participant data. Data were collected between December 2015 and November 2017 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines. Results were summarized across participants and studies in a random-effects model. The main, a priori outcome was NPS response; pain reports were assessed as a secondary outcome. We obtained data from 20 of 28 identified eligible studies, resulting in a total sample size of 603 healthy individuals. The NPS responses to painful stimulation compared with baseline conditions were positive in 575 participants (95.4%), with a very large effect size (g\u2009=\u20092.30 [95% CI, 1.92 to 2.69]), confirming its sensitivity to nociceptive pain in this sample. Placebo treatments showed significant behavioral outcomes on pain ratings in 17 of 20 studies (85%) and in the combined sample (g\u2009=\u2009-0.66 [95% CI, -0.80 to -0.53]). However, placebo effects on the NPS response were significant in only 3 of 20 studies (15%) and were very small in the combined sample (g\u2009=\u2009-0.08 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.01]). Similarly, analyses restricted to studies with low risk of bias (g\u2009=\u2009-0.07 [95% CI, -0.15 to 0.00]) indicated very small effects, and analyses of just placebo responders (g\u2009=\u2009-0.22 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.11]) indicated small effects, as well. Placebo treatments have moderate analgesic effects on pain reports. The very small effects on NPS, a validated measure that tracks levels of nociceptive pain, indicate that placebo treatments affect pain via brain mechanisms largely independent of effects on bottom-up nociceptive processing.

Analyses collapsing across different types of shifting gave more consistent results overall than analysis within individual types, suggesting a commonality across types of shifting. These areas shared substantial, significant overlap with regions derived from kernel-based analyses of reported peaks for executive processes in working memory (WM). The results suggest that there is a common set of brain regions active in diverse executive control operations, including medial prefrontal, superior and inferior parietal, medial parietal, and premotor cortices. However, within several of these regions, different types of switching produced spatially discriminable activation foci.

Three main subtypes have been recognized: behavioural-variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), each of which has a distinct clinical and cognitive profile. Although the role of the cerebellum in cognition is increasingly accepted, knowledge of cerebellar changes across neuroimaging modalities and their contribution to behavioural and cognitive changes in FTD syndromes is currently scant. We conducted an anatomical/activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis in 53 neuroimaging studies (structural MRI: 42; positron emission tomography: 6; functional MRI: 4; single-photon emission computed tomography: 1) to identify the patterns of cerebellar changes and their relations to profiles of behavioural and cognitive deficits in FTD syndromes. Overall, widespread bilateral cerebellar changes were found in FTD and notably the patterns were subtype specific. In bvFTD, ALE peaks were identified in the bilateral Crus, left lobule VI, right lobules VIIb and VIIIb. In SD, focal cerebellar changes were located in the left Crus I and lobule VI. A separate ALE meta-analysis on PNFA studies was not performed due to the limited number of studies available. In addition, the ALE analysis indicated that bilateral Crus I and Crus II were associated with behavioural disruption and cognitive dysfunction. This ALE meta-analysis provides the quantification of the location and extent of cerebellar changes across the main FTD syndromes, which in turn provides evidence of cerebellar contributions to behavioural and cognitive changes in FTD. These results bring new insights into the mechanisms mediating FTD symptomatology.

Although, interference processing in the emotional domain has recently attracted great interest, the question of whether there are separable neural patterns for emotional and non-emotional interference processing remains open. Here, we performed an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 78 neuroimaging experiments, and examined common and distinct neural systems for emotional and non-emotional interference processing. We examined brain activation in three domains of interference processing: emotional verbal interference in the face-word conflict task, non-emotional verbal interference in the color-word Stroop task, and non-emotional spatial interference in the Simon, SRC and Flanker tasks. Our results show that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was recruited for both emotional and non-emotional interference. In addition, the right anterior insula, presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were activated by interference processing across both emotional and non-emotional domains. In light of these results, we propose that the anterior insular cortex may serve to integrate information from different dimensions and work together with the dorsal ACC to detect and monitor conflicts, whereas pre-SMA and right IFG may be recruited to inhibit inappropriate responses. In contrast, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) showed different degrees of activation and distinct lateralization patterns for different processing domains, which suggests that these regions may implement cognitive control based on the specific task requirements.

The aim of our study was to integrate studies of resting-state fMRI and explore the alterations of abnormal brain activity in first-episode, drug-na\u00efve patients with major depressive disorder. Relevant imaging reports in English were searched, retrieved, selected and subjected to analysis by activation likelihood estimation, a coordinate-based meta-analysis technique (final sample, 31 studies). Coordinates extracted from the original reports were assigned to two categories based on effect directionality. Compared with healthy controls, the first-episode, medication-na\u00efve major depressive disorder patients showed decreased brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, posterior precuneus, and posterior cingulate, as well as in visual areas within the occipital lobe, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus, and increased activity in the putamen and anterior precuneus. Not every study that has reported relevant data met the inclusion criteria.

This meta-analysis assessed abnormal brain activation in SCI patients to understand the pattern of reorganization in the brain after SCI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that compared SCI patients with controls and were published before August 30, 2018, were extracted from the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Voxel-wise whole-brain meta-analysis and region-of-interest meta-analysis of group differences were separately performed. Then, meta-regression analysis was conducted with several clinical characteristics as regressors. Sixteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified. Compared with control individuals, SCI patients showed increased activation in the sensorimotor cortex in both whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. In addition, whole-brain meta-analysis revealed increased activation in the cerebellum, and this increase was positively correlated with lesion level and injury severity. Our results demonstrated that reorganization occurred mainly in the sensorimotor system of the brain after SCI, implying that brain functions involved in sensorimotor demands can still be preserved in this condition. These findings provide opportunities for future studies in terms of therapeutic strategies and prognosis assessment.

Biofeedback has been employed in psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), mainly by using neural signals - neurofeedback. Recently, OCD has been integrated into the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCD&RD) category (body dysmorphic, hoarding, trichotillomania/hair-pulling, and excoriation/skin-picking disorders). The efficacy of biofeedback for OCD&RD is still unknown. Our work provides a complete overview of publications assessing the therapeutic efficacy of biofeedback in OCD&RD with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We found ten studies involving 102 OCD participants (three randomized controlled trials) mostly applying neurofeedback (one publication used thermal biofeedback). Five neurofeedback studies were selected for meta-analysis (89 patients; two randomized controlled trials). The overall effect size within the treatment group varied between medium to large, but high heterogeneity and inconsistency values were found. The methodological quality was low indicating a high risk of bias. In conclusion, a beneficial effect of neurofeedback for OCD patients was found but also critical limitations on methodology, high heterogeneity among studies, and a putative reporting bias. Future research following high-quality guidelines should be conducted to address the efficacy of biofeedback approaches for OCD&RD.

Humans can be motivated to give for many reasons. Some generosity incurs a definite cost, with no extrinsic reward to the act, but instead provides intrinsic satisfaction (labelled here as 'altruistic' giving). Other giving behaviours are done with the prospect of improving one's own situation via reciprocity, reputation, or public good (labelled here as 'strategic' giving). These contexts differ in the source, certainty, and timing of rewards as well as the inferences made about others' mental states. We executed a combined statistical map and coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis of decisions to give (36 studies, 1150 participants). Methods included a novel approach for accommodating variable signal dropout between studies in meta-analysis. Results reveal consistent, cross-paradigm neural correlates of each decision type, commonalities, and informative differences. Relative to being selfish, altruistic and strategic giving activate overlapping reward networks. However, strategic decisions showed greater activity in striatal regions than altruistic choices. Altruistic giving, more than strategic, activated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is consistently involved during generous decisions and processing across a posterior to anterior axis differentiates the altruistic/strategic context. Posterior vmPFC was preferentially recruited during altruistic decisions. Regions of the 'social brain' showed distinct patterns of activity between choice types, reflecting the different use of theory of mind in the two contexts. We provide the consistent neural correlates of decisions to give, and show that many will depend on the source of incentives.

To synthesize this literature and overcome inconsistencies, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 18 whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (541 patients, 572 healthy controls) comparing seed-based FC between OCD patients and healthy controls. In patients, the meta-analysis revealed (1) consistent hypoconnectivity within frontoparietal and salience network, and between salience, frontoparietal and default-mode network, and (2) consistent general dysconnectivity (no specific direction of connectivity change) within default-mode and frontoparietal network, as well as between frontoparietal, default-mode, and salience networks. Between-network hypoconnectivity provides evidence for the triple-network model in OCD, while aberrant within-network connectivity of frontoparietal and striatal regions supports reports of aberrant fronto-striatal circuitry. Therefore, results corroborate both models of OCD pathophysiology and link them by underlining the importance of intrinsic connectivity of frontoparietal regions which are common to both models.

Neuroimaging studies show that social-based and fairness-related decision-making activates an inconsistent set of areas, which sometimes includes the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and others lateral prefrontal cortices. Social-based decision-making is complex and variability in findings may be driven by socio-cognitive activities related to social norms. To distinguish among social-cognitive activities related to social norms, we identified 36 eligible articles in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, which we separate into two categories (a) social norm representation and (b) norm violations. The majority of original articles (>60%) used tasks associated with fairness norms and decision-making, such as ultimatum game, dictator game, or prisoner's dilemma; the rest used tasks associated to violation of moral norms, such as scenarios and sentences of moral depravity ratings. Using quantitative meta-analyses, we report common and distinct brain areas that show concordance as a function of category. Specifically, concordance in ventromedial prefrontal regions is distinct to social norm representation processing, whereas concordance in right insula, dorsolateral prefrontal, and dorsal cingulate cortices is distinct to norm violation processing.

A sufficiently powered meta-analysis of structural (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) alterations in RELs is still lacking. Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating RELs and healthy controls (HCs) published by July 2017 were included in the meta-analyses. Study procedures were conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Random-effects coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed across all the studies per imaging modality using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). For fMRI studies, meta-analyses were calculated for each task type. For sMRI studies, regional volumetric changes-analyses were estimated using R. Finally, multimodal meta-analyses of structural and functional abnormalities were performed. Sixty-nine imaging studies (2195 RELs and 3169 HCs) were included in the meta-analyses. RELs showed hyperactivation in the fronto-striatal regions as well as parietal hypoactivation during cognition. Also, activation was increased in the amygdala during emotional processing and in the orbitofrontal cortex during reward, respectively. Frontal and superior temporal cortex were hypertrophic in RELs. The right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) showed both increased activation during cognitive tasks and greater volume in RELs. Our findings demonstrate that increased brain volume and activation are present in RELs and may represent intermediate phenotypes for the disorder. Furthermore, some neural changes including increased rIFG volume may be associated with the resilience to BD.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to identify transdiagnostic and disorder-specific abnormalities during the processing of negative compared with neutral stimuli. We synthesized neuroimaging findings of affect processing in BPD, MDD, and PTSD and calculated combined coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses.

Twenty-four studies had a focus on BPD (431 individuals with BPD, 436 healthy control subjects [HCs]), 32 studies on MDD (789 individuals with current MDD, 870 HCs), and 14 studies on PTSD (247 individuals with PTSD, 245 HCs). Findings showed limbic hyperactivations in BPD and PTSD compared with limbic activation of HCs. In contrast, patients with MDD showed blunted amygdala activation in comparison with that of HCs. Additionally, the calculation of overlapping brain abnormalities in BPD, MDD, and PTSD highlighted transdiagnostic hyperactivation of the right median cingulate gyri and hypoactivation of the right middle frontal gyrus and the right middle occipital gyrus. Finally, disorder-specific comparisons also illustrate unique abnormalities for each mental disorder.

Our aim was to determine whether persistent peripheral nerve changes arising from Bell palsy result in persistent altered brain function in motor pathways in synkinesis. A literature search using terms related to facial paralysis, Bell palsy, synkinesis, and fMRI through May 2021 was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Additionally, an fMRI study examined lip and eyeblink movements in 2 groups: individuals who fully recovered following Bell palsy and individuals who developed synkinesis. Task-based data of the whole brain that required lip movements in healthy controls were extracted from 7 publications. Three studies contributed similar whole-brain analyses in acute Bell palsy. The meta-analysis of fMRI in healthy control and Bell palsy groups determined common clusters of activation within each group using activation likelihood estimates. A separate fMRI study used multivariate general linear modeling to identify changes associated with synkinesis in smiling and blinking tasks. A region of the precentral gyrus contralateral to the paretic side of the face was hypoactive in synkinesis during lip movements compared with controls. This region was centered in a cluster of activation identified in the meta-analysis of the healthy controls but absent from individuals with Bell palsy. The meta-analysis relied on a small set of studies. The small sample of subjects with synkinesis limited the power of the fMRI analysis.

We aimed at investigating the neural correlates of MCI in PD combining multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with large-scale data from the literature. We analyzed 31 PD patients and 30 matched controls. The standard neuropsychological assessment of PD-MCI covered memory, attention, executive functions, language and visuospatial abilities. Following validated criteria, 16 patients were classified as showing MCI. Whole-brain functional connectivity and structural volume changes were assessed, respectively, by means of eigenvector centrality (EC) and voxel-based morphometry. To address the involvement of specific functional brain networks, we validated our results by building a meta-analytic co-activation map (MACM) based on the previous literature and then testing its overlap with the parcellation of functional networks derived from 1000 healthy controls. The EC comparison between PD with normal cognition and controls showed a selective decline in interconnectedness in the bilateral lentiform nuclei. Differently, comparing PD with MCI and controls revealed additional changes in non-motor areas. Directly comparing PD with and without MCI, we found a reduced interconnectedness in the bilateral superior parietal lobules and precuneus. No differences in brain volume were detected comparing these patient groups. The MACM and overlap analyses showed that the observed connectivity changes were localized in the hubs of the dorsal attention network. Notably, this aligned with the predominant attention deficit observed in our sample. Overall, functional impairment in the dorsal attention network seems to be the hallmark of MCI due to PD, thus extending previous findings of brain connectivity disruption in non-motor networks.

A comprehensive literature search strategy was applied to select pertinent studies up to December 2022 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Voxel-wise meta-analysis was conducted via the latest meta-analytic algorithm, seed-based d mapping with permutation of subject images software. Meta-regression analyses were also conducted to explore the potential effect of clinical variables on resting-state neural activity. Eleven studies comprising 304 patients with ESRD and 296 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Compared with HCs, ESRD patients showed decreased brain activity in the default mode network (DMN) regions, including the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral midcingulate cortex/posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, and right angular gyrus. The neural activities in the bilateral midcingulate cortex, bilateral midcingulate cortex/posterior cingulate cortex, and right angular gyrus were significantly associated with serological indexes including hemoglobin, urea, and creatinine levels. The present study provides a quantitative overview of brain activity alterations in patients with ESRD, and the results confirm the essential role of the DMN in ESRD patients, which may be the potential neural basis of their cognitive deficits.

Disgust processing, in general, engaged a bilateral network encompassing the insula, amygdala, occipital and prefrontal regions. Core disgust evoked stronger reactivity in left-lateralized threat detection and defensive response network including amygdala, occipital and frontal regions, while social disgust engaged a right-lateralized superior temporal-frontal network involved in social cognition.

We searched the PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO databases to identify positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing brain activation in specific phobia patients and healthy controls. Two raters independently extracted study data from all the eligible studies, and pooled coordinates from these studies using activation likelihood estimation, a quantitative meta-analytic technique.

Thirteen studies were included, comprising 327 participants. Regions that were consistently activated in response to phobic stimuli included the left insula, amygdala, and globus pallidus. Compared to healthy controls, phobic subjects had increased activation in response to phobic stimuli in the left amygdala/globus pallidus, left insula, right thalamus (pulvinar), and cerebellum. Following exposure-based therapy widespread deactivation was observed in the right frontal cortex, limbic cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum, with increased activation detected in the thalamus.

We identified primary studies through a comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases. The GingerALE software (version 2.3.6) from the BrainMap Project was used to conduct activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses of the eligible studies for cognition, emotion and interface of both. Relative to the non-clinical (NC) group, the PTSD group showed greater activation during emotional tasks in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. In contrast, the NC group showed significantly greater activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than did the PTSD group in the emotional tasks. When both emotional and cognitive processing were evaluated, the PTSD group showed significantly greater activation in the striatum than did the NC group. No differences in activation between the PTSD and NC groups were noted when only the cognitive systems were examined. Individuals with PTSD exhibited overactivity in the subcortical regions, i.e., amygdala and striatum, when processing emotions. Underactivity in the emotional and cognitive processing intermediary cortex, i.e., the ACC, was especially prominent in individuals with PTSD relative to the NC population following exposure to emotional stimuli. These findings may explain the trauma-related fear, irritability, and negative effects as well as the concentration difficulties during cognitive distress associated with emotional arousal, that are commonly observed in individuals with PTSD.

However, no review has yet examined its role in depression by integrating conceptual and quantitative findings across functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG methodologies. The authors quantified these effects, with an emphasis on development. A total of 38 fMRI and 12 EEG studies were entered into fMRI and EEG meta-analyses. fMRI studies primarily examined reward anticipation and reward feedback. These were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. EEG studies involved mainly the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential, and these studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis of the association between FRN and depression. Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included, reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation, an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression, with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies, reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression in adolescents. Taken together, the findings show consistent neural aberrations during reward processing in depression, namely, reduced striatal signal during feedback and blunted FRN. These aberrations may underlie the pathogenesis of depression and have important implications for development of new treatments.

Based on the ALE results, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed that distributed brain regions were more active under divergent thinking tasks (DTTs) than those under control tasks, but a large portion of the brain regions were deactivated. The ALE results indicated that the brain networks of the creative idea generation in DTTs may be composed of the lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex [such as the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and precuneus (BA 7)], anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA 32), and several regions in the temporal cortex [such as the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 39), and left fusiform gyrus (BA 37)]. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) was related to selecting the loosely and remotely associated concepts and organizing them into creative ideas, whereas the ACC (BA 32) was related to observing and forming distant semantic associations in performing DTTs. The posterior parietal cortex may be involved in the semantic information related to the retrieval and buffering of the formed creative ideas, and several regions in the temporal cortex may be related to the stored long-term memory. In addition, the ALE results of the structural studies showed that divergent thinking was related to the dopaminergic system (e.g., left caudate and claustrum). Based on the ALE results, both fMRI and structural MRI studies could uncover the neural basis of divergent thinking from different aspects (e.g., specific cognitive processing and stable individual difference of cognitive capability).

Evidence suggests a prefrontal cortex 'abstraction hierarchy', from abstract planning in more anterior regions to concrete processing in posterior regions. Because abstraction has been linked with making LargerLater choices, we hypothesized an association between LargerLater choices and more anterior prefrontal cortex activity, and an association between SmallerSooner choices and more posterior activity. Across thirteen fMRI temporal discounting studies including 436 subjects, we observed LargerLater activity anterior of SmallerSooner activity, both in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, consistent with our pre-registered hypothesis.

Our aim was to quantitatively summarize overlap and divergence in regions of altered brain activation associated with depression under emotionally valenced compared to cognitively demanding task conditions, and with reference to intrinsic functional connectivity. We hypothesized differences reflective of task demands. A co-ordinate-based meta-analysis technique, activation likelihood estimation, was used to analyze relevant imaging literature. These studies compared brain activity in depressed adults relative to healthy controls during three conditions: (i) emotionally valenced (cognitively easy) tasks (n\u2009=\u200929); (ii) cognitively demanding tasks (n\u2009=\u200915); and (iii) resting conditions (n\u2009=\u200921). The meta-analyses identified five, eight, and seven significant clusters of altered brain activity under emotion, cognition, and resting conditions, respectively, in depressed individuals compared to healthy controls. Regions of overlap and divergence between pairs of the three separate meta-analyses were quantified. There were no significant regions of overlap between emotion and cognition meta-analyses, but several divergent clusters were found. Cognitively demanding conditions were associated with greater activation of right medial frontal and insula regions while bilateral amygdala was more significantly altered during emotion (cognitively undemanding) conditions; consistent with task demands. Overlap was present in left amygdala and right subcallosal cingulate between emotion and resting meta-analyses, with no significant divergence. Our meta-analyses highlight alteration of common brain regions, during cognitively undemanding emotional tasks and resting conditions but divergence of regions between emotional and cognitively demanding tasks. Regions altered reflect current biological and system-level models of depression and highlight the relationship with task condition and difficulty.

There is growing evidence, however, to support an alternative model, which proposes that neural areas associated with specific inhibitory control tasks co-exist as common network mechanisms, supporting diverse cognitive processes. This meta-analysis of 225 studies comprising 323 experiments examined the common and distinct neural correlates of cognitive processes for response inhibition, namely interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation. Activation coordinates for each subcategory were extracted using multilevel kernel density analysis\u00a0(MKDA). The extracted activity patterns were then mapped onto the brain functional network atlas to derive the common (i.e., process-general) and distinct (i.e., domain-oriented) neural network correlates of these processes. Independent of the task types, activation of the right hemispheric regions (inferior frontal gyrus, insula, median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri) and superior parietal gyrus was common across the cognitive processes studied. Mapping the activation patterns to a brain functional network atlas revealed that the fronto-parietal and ventral attention networks were the core neural systems that were commonly engaged in different processes of response inhibition. Subtraction analyses elucidated the distinct neural substrates of interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation, revealing stronger activation in the ventral attention network for interference resolution than action inhibition. On the other hand, action withholding/cancellation primarily engaged the fronto-striatal circuit. Overall, our results suggest that response inhibition is a multidimensional cognitive process involving multiple neural regions and networks for coordinating optimal performance. This finding has significant implications for the understanding and assessment of response inhibition.

A regulatory dopamine 2-receptor gene (DRD2) polymorphism (rs1076560; G>T) has been identified as a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. Studies report conflicting results on its involvement in schizophrenia intermediate phenotypes and no systematic review on this topic has been published. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether this polymorphism is implicated in schizophrenia intermediate phenotypes by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Alternative allele carrier status negatively affected all intermediate phenotypes except for brain morphology, for which inconsistent genotype effects were found. Specifically, alternative allele carriers showed inefficient brain recruitment in healthy subjects and decreased brain recruitment in schizophrenia patients. Finally, significant results of the meta-analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects pinpointed rs1076560-associated brain regions, in particular the fronto-striatal network. To increase homogeneity and thus improve comparability in future genetic studies investigating SCZ intermediate phenotypes, we highlight methodological caveats and provide suggestions to circumvent such pitfalls.

In the current study, we performed an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies assessing age-related differences in the neural correlates of episodic encoding. Only studies using the subsequent memory paradigm were included. We found age-related under-recruitment of occipital and fusiform cortex, but over-recruitment in a set of regions including bilateral middle/superior frontal gyri, anterior medial frontal gyrus, precuneus and left inferior parietal lobe. We demonstrate that all of the regions consistently over-recruited by older adults during successful encoding exhibit either direct overlap, or occur in close vicinity to regions consistently involved in unsuccessful encoding in young adults. We discuss the possibility that this overall pattern of age-related differences represents an age-related shift in focus: away from perceptual details, and toward evaluative and personal thoughts and feelings during memory tasks. We discuss whether these age-related differences in brain activation benefit performance in older adults, and additional considerations.

To establish shared and disorder-specific structural, functional, and overlapping multimodal abnormalities in these 2 disorders through a voxel-based meta-analytic comparison of whole-brain gray matter volume (GMV) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of inhibition in patients with ADHD and OCD. Literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus up to September 30, 2015. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or fMRI studies during inhibitory control comparing children and adults with ADHD or OCD with controls. Voxel-wise meta-analyses of GMV or fMRI differences were performed using Seed-based d-Mapping. Regional structure and function abnormalities were assessed within each patient group and then a quantitative comparison was performed of abnormalities (relative to controls) between ADHD and OCD. Meta-analytic disorder-specific and shared abnormalities in GMV, in inhibitory fMRI, and in multimodal functional and structural measures. The search revealed 27 ADHD VBM data sets (including 931 patients with ADHD\u2009and 822 controls), 30 OCD VBM data sets (928 patients with OCD\u2009and 942 controls), 33 ADHD fMRI data sets (489 patients with ADHD\u2009and 591 controls), and 18 OCD fMRI data sets (287 patients with OCD\u2009and 284 controls).

Changes in activity in the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex distinguished PTSD from both control groups.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have repeatedly found a large number of structures, usually including a right lateralized parieto-frontal network and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). However, it is unlikely that all these regions are directly related to the mechanism that actively suppresses the motor command. Since most go/no-go designs involve complex stimulus identification/detection processes, these activations may rather reflect the engagement of different cognitive processes that are intrinsically related and quite difficult to disentangle. The current critical review is based on repeated meta-analyses of 30 go/no-go fMRI experiments using the Activation Likelihood Estimate method to contrast studies using simple vs. complex stimuli. The results show that most of the activity typically elicited by no-go signals, including pre-SMA hemodynamic response, is actually driven by the engagement of high attentional or working memory resources, not by inhibitory processes per se.

A clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia is defined as the presence of brief, attenuated, or intermittent psychotic symptoms in non-schizophrenic individuals. The transition to schizophrenia appears significantly more frequent in this at-risk population than in the general population. Moreover, the ability to attribute mental states to others, known as mentalizing or theory of mind, and its neural correlates found in individuals with CHR are similar to those described in patients with schizophrenia. We have therefore explored neurofunctional correlates of mentalizing in individuals with CHR vs. healthy controls, in order to identify the differences in brain activation. A neural coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of existing neuroimaging data revealed that three regions displayed decreased activation in individuals with CHR, compared with healthy controls: the right temporoparietal junction, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left precuneus. These results, combined with those in the literature, further support the hypothesis that abnormal activation of posterior brain regions involved in mentalizing correlates with psychotic symptoms in help-seeking individuals.

Due to methodological issues, the data reported in these studies are often confusing. Here we summarize the fMRI data from previous studies and explore the possibility of a neural segregation between BR supporting actions (body-schema, BS) or not (non-oriented-to-action-body-representation, NA). We performed a general activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 59 fMRI experiments and two individual meta-analyses to identify the neural substrates of different BR. Body processing involves a wide network of areas in occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal lobes. NA selectively activates the somatosensory primary cortex and the supramarginal gyrus. BS involves the primary motor area and the right extrastriate body area. Our data suggest that motor information and recognition of body parts are fundamental to build BS.

Although activations have consistently been reported within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), it remains unclear which ACC subdivision is particularly involved. To provide a quantitative estimation of the specific involvement of ACC subdivisions in social pain, we conducted a voxel-based meta-analysis. The literature search identified 46 articles that included 940 subjects, the majority of which used the cyberball task. Significant likelihoods of activation were found in both the ventral and dorsal ACC for both social pain elicitation and self-reported distress during social pain. Self-reported distress involved more specifically the subgenual and pregenual ACC than social pain-related contrasts. The cyberball task involved the anterior midcingulate cortex to a lesser extent than other experimental tasks. During social pain, children exhibited subgenual activations to a greater extent than adults. Finally, the ventro-dorsal gradient of ACC activations in cyberball studies was related to the length of exclusion phases. The present meta-analysis contributes to a better understanding of the role of ACC subdivisions in social pain, and it could be of particular importance for guiding future studies of social pain and its neural underpinnings.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the frequency with which occipital cortex activity is observed during drug cue exposure and to determine its spatial distribution. A comprehensive literature search was performed of human functional neuroimaging studies of drug cue-reactivity. Fifty-five studies were used to determine the frequency with which clusters of significant visual cortex activity during visual drug cues versus non-drug cues were reported. The spatial distribution of visual cortex activations was determined via activation likelihood estimation (ALE; FDR corrected, p<0.01) in a subset of these studies (n=24). Eighty-six percent of studies that reported fMRI results for drug versus neutral visual cues within a substance-dependent group showed significant drug-elicited activity in the visual cortex. ALE revealed clusters in the left secondary visual cortex (BA 19) and clusters in the primary visual cortex (BA 17) that were consistently activated by drug cues. These data demonstrate that the visual cortex, often overlooked in our discussions of the neural circuitry of addiction, consistently discriminates drug cues from neutral cues in substance dependent populations. While it remains unclear whether drug cue-elicited activation in occipital cortex is related to the rewarding properties of the drug and/or attentional mechanisms, these data support further exploration.

Current source reconstruction is defined as an ill-posed inverse problem, since the number of sensors is less than the number of current sources. One powerful approach to solving this problem is to use functional MRI (fMRI) data as a spatial constraint, although it boosts the cost of measurement and the burden on subjects. Here, we show how to use the meta-analysis fMRI data synthesized from thousands of papers instead of the individually recorded fMRI data. To mitigate the differences between the meta-analysis and individual data, the former are imported as prior information of the hierarchical Bayesian estimation. Using realistic simulations, we found out the performance of current source reconstruction using meta-analysis fMRI data to be better than that using low-quality individual fMRI data and conventional methods. By applying experimental data of a face recognition task, we qualitatively confirmed that group analysis results using the meta-analysis fMRI data showed a tendency similar to the results using the individual fMRI data. Our results indicate that the use of meta-analysis fMRI data improves current source reconstruction without additional measurement costs. We assume the proposed method would have greater effect for modalities with lower measurement costs, such as optically pumped magnetometers.

To date, several meta-analyses of studies using cognitive reappraisal tasks in healthy volunteers have been carried out, but no meta-analyses have yet been performed on the fMRI data of clinical populations with identified alterations in emotion regulation capacity. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies in populations of patients with mood or anxiety disorders, yielding a pooled sample of 247 patients and 262 controls from thirteen independent studies. As a distinguishing feature of this meta-analysis, original statistical brain maps were obtained from six of these studies. Our primary results demonstrated that patients with mood and anxiety disorders recruited the regulatory fronto-parietal network involved in cognitive reappraisal to a lesser extent in comparison to healthy controls. Conversely, they presented increased activation in regions that may be associated with the emotional experience (i.e., insula, cerebellum, precentral and inferior occipital gyri) and in regions whose activation may be the consequence of compensatory mechanisms (i.e., supramarginal gyri and superior parietal lobule). Moreover, activations in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left superior temporal gyrus were associated with reinterpretation emotion regulation strategies, whereas medial frontal and parietal activations were associated with the deployment of distancing strategies. The regions revealed by this meta-analysis conform to a pattern of dysfunctional brain activation during cognitive reappraisal common to mood and anxiety disorders. As such, this neural pattern may reflect a transdiagnostic feature of these disorders.
