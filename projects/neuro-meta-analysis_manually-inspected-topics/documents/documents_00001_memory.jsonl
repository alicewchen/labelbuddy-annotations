Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: young (23.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.63 years) and older (66.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.70 years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula, claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement. Our results provide important new knowledge for improving methodology and theories of cognition across the lifespan.

These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, replicating results in animals, or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena. It has remained difficult, however, to synthesize these findings into a systems neuroscience account of how networks across the whole-brain support the enhancing effects of emotion on memory encoding. To this end, the present study employed a meta-analytic approach using activation likelihood estimates to assess the anatomical specificity and reliability of event-related fMRI activations related to successful memory encoding for emotional versus neutral information. The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala, anterior hippocampus, anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the ventral visual stream, left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex. The results within the amygdala and MTL support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects. The consistency of findings in cortical targets, including the visual, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, underscores the importance of generating hypotheses regarding their participation in emotional memory formation. In particular, we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing, semantic elaboration, and attention, which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material. These findings may motivate future research on emotional modulation of widespread neural systems and the implications of this modulation for cognition.

We performed a systematic, quantitative, coordinate-based whole-brain activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comprising 292 MCI and 102 AD patients contrasted to 409 age-matched control subjects. We included episodic encoding and/or retrieval phases, investigated the effects of group, verbal or image stimuli and correlated mean Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores with the modelled activation estimates. MCI patients presented increased right hippocampal activation during memory encoding, decreased activation in the left hippocampus and fusiform gyrus during retrieval tasks, as well as attenuated activation in the right anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus during verbal retrieval. In AD patients, however, stronger activation within the precuneus during encoding tasks was accompanied by attenuated right hippocampal activation during retrieval tasks. Low cognitive performance (MMSE scores) was associated with stronger activation of the precuneus and reduced activation of the right (para)hippocampus and anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. This meta-analysis provides evidence for a specific and probably disease stage-dependent brain activation pattern related to the pathognomonic AD characteristic of episodic memory loss.

Our results found that activation common to all three EF subcomponents converged in the multiple-demand network across adolescence and adulthood. The function of EF with the multiple-demand network involved, especially for the prefrontal cortex and the parietal regions, could not be mature until adulthood. In adolescents, only working memory could be separable from common EF, whereas in adults, the three EF subcomponents could be separable from common EF. However, findings of switching in adolescents should be treated with substantial caution and may be exploratory due to limited data available on switching tasks. For task materials, inhibition and working memory showed both domain generality and domain specificity, undergirded by the multiple-demand network, as well as different brain regions in response to verbal and nonverbal task materials, respectively. In contrast, switching showed only domain generality with no activation specialized for either verbal or nonverbal task materials. These findings, taken together, support and contribute to the unitary-diverse nature of EF such that EF should be interpreted in an integrative model that relies on the integration of the EF construct, development, and task materials.

In addition, high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates and electrophysiological studies of humans also suggest regions of the ventral ATL are sensitive to novel faces. The current study extends previous findings by investigating whether similar subregions in the dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL are sensitive to personally familiar, famous, and novel faces. We present the results of two studies of person memory: a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies and an empirical fMRI study using optimized imaging parameters. Both studies showed left-lateralized ATL activations to familiar individuals while novel faces activated the right ATL. Activations to famous faces were quite ventral, similar to what has been reported in previous high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates. These findings suggest that face memory-sensitive patches in the human ATL are in the ventral/polar ATL.

The meta-analysis considered both subsequent memory (SM; remembered>forgotten) and subsequent forgetting (SF; forgotten>remembered) effects, restricting the data used to that concerning visual information encoding in healthy young adults. The meta-analysis of SM effects indicated that they most consistently associated with five neural regions: left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), bilateral fusiform cortex, bilateral hippocampal formation, bilateral premotor cortex (PMC), and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Direct comparisons of the SM effects between the studies using verbal versus pictorial material and item-memory versus associative-memory tasks yielded three main sets of findings. First, the left IFC exhibited greater SM effects during verbal material than pictorial material encoding, whereas the fusiform cortex exhibited greater SM effects during pictorial material rather than verbal material encoding. Second, bilateral hippocampal regions showed greater SM effects during pictorial material encoding compared to verbal material encoding. Furthermore, the left hippocampal region showed greater SM effects during pictorial-associative versus pictorial-item encoding. Third, bilateral PMC and PPC regions, which may support attention during encoding, exhibited greater SM effects during item encoding than during associative encoding. The meta-analysis of SF effects indicated they associated mostly with default-mode network regions, including the anterior and posterior midline cortex, the bilateral temporoparietal junction, and the bilateral superior frontal cortex. Recurrent activity oscillations between the task-positive and task-negative/default-mode networks may account for trial-to-trial variability in participants' encoding performances, which is a fundamental source of both SM and SF effects. Taken together, these findings clarify the neural activity that supports successful encoding, as well as the neural activity that leads to encoding failure.

Recent debate on the underlying neural substrates of visual working memory has focused on the delay period of relevant tasks. Persistent neural activity throughout the delay period has been recognized as a correlate of working memory, yet regions demonstrating sustained hemodynamic responses show inconsistency across individual studies. To develop a more precise understanding of delay-period activations during visual working memory, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis on 30 fMRI experiments involving 515 healthy adults with a mean age of 25.65 years. The main analysis revealed a widespread frontoparietal network associated with delay-period activity, as well as activation in the right inferior temporal cortex. These findings were replicated using different meta-analytical algorithms and were shown to be robust against between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. Further meta-analyses on different subgroups of experiments with specific task demands and stimulus types revealed similar delay-period networks, with activations distributed across the frontal and parietal cortices. The roles of prefrontal regions, posterior parietal regions, and inferior temporal areas are reviewed and discussed in the context of content-specific storage. We conclude that cognitive operations that occur during the unfilled delay period in visual working memory tasks can be flexibly expressed across a frontoparietal-temporal network depending on experimental parameters.

Since its inception, it has become one of the leading explanations for how humans are able to operate on a cognitive level. The current study probed the neural networks underlying one of the most commonly used tasks, delayed match-to-sample (DMTS), to study WM. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis of 42 functional neuroimaging studies (626 participants) was conducted to demonstrate neural network engagement during DMTS. Results demonstrated strong convergence in brain regions commonly associated with the working memory construct (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex). However, neural activation in two regions frequently attributed to WM were absent from this meta-analysis: the anterior cingulate and the rostral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that these regions may be more sensitive to task or stimuli characteristics. In a post-hoc analysis, we deconstructed the DMTS meta-analysis to examine nonverbal versus verbal stimuli, and found notable neurofunctional differences such that DMTS using nonverbal stimuli consistently engaged the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 6/46) and precuneus (BA 7) more so than verbal stimuli based DMTS. These results provide a foundation for future models of functional connectivity that may elucidate subtle differences in working memory attributable to pathological processes.

Diffuse activation was exhibited in the HOA sample, while activation was more limited in the clinical populations. Additionally, the HOA sample showed more activation in the right hippocampus compared to the AD sample. The MCI studies showed greater activation in the cerebellum compared to the HOA sample, potentially indicating a compensatory mechanism for verbal encoding.

However, a theoretical debate still exists about where EAMs are stored in our brain and about hippocampal unique contribution to their recollection. Here we disentangled this issue performing an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on 79 neuroimaging experiments, classified according to the remoteness of EAMs, and meta-analytic connectivity modeling. A wide brain network, spanning from occipital to frontal lobe, was involved in recalling EAMs. However, remote and recent EAMs were processed by different nodes of this network: recent EAMs activated angular gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, that we found to be connected with its contralateral homologous, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior parietal lobule.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the convergence of findings from published randomized control trials studies that examined brain activation changes in postmenopausal women. A systematic search for fMRI studies of neural responses during working memory tasks in postmenopausal women was performed. Studies were excluded if they were not treatment studies and did not contain placebo or blank controls. For the purpose of the meta-analysis, 8 studies were identified, with 103 postmenopausal women taking HT and 109 controls. Compared with controls, postmenopausal women who took HT increased activation in the left frontal lobe, including superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), anterior lobe, paracentral lobule (BA 7), limbic lobe, and anterior cingulate (BA 32). Additionally, decreased activation is noted in the right limbic lobe, including parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28), left parietal lobe, and superior parietal lobule (BA 7). All regions were significant at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 with correction for multiple comparisons. Hormone treatment is associated with BOLD signal activation in key anatomical areas during fMRI working memory tasks in healthy hormone-treated postmenopausal women. A positive correlation between activation and task performance suggests that hormone use may benefit working memory.

Moreover, impairments of working memory functions may be found in nearly all neurological and psychiatric diseases. To examine what brain regions are commonly and differently active during various working memory tasks, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis over 189 fMRI experiments on healthy subjects. The main effect yielded a widespread bilateral fronto-parietal network. Further meta-analyses revealed that several regions were sensitive to specific task components, e.g. Broca's region was selectively active during verbal tasks or ventral and dorsal premotor cortex were preferentially involved in memory for object identity and location, respectively. Moreover, the lateral prefrontal cortex showed a division in a rostral and a caudal part based on differential involvement in task set and load effects. Nevertheless, a consistent but more restricted \"core\" network emerged from conjunctions across analyses of specific task designs and contrasts. This \"core\" network appears to comprise the quintessence of regions, which are necessary during working memory tasks. It may be argued that the core regions form a distributed executive network with potentially generalized functions for focussing on competing representations in the brain. The present study demonstrates that meta-analyses are a powerful tool to integrate the data of functional imaging studies on a (broader) psychological construct, probing the consistency across various paradigms as well as the differential effects of different experimental implementations.

To address this issue, I constructed a model of intrinsic network contributions to different WM phases and then evaluated the validity of the model by performing a quantitative meta-analysis of relevant functional neuroimaging data. The model suggests that the transition from the encoding to maintenance and to retrieval stages involves progressively decreasing involvement of the dorsal attention network (DAN), but progressively increasing involvement of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN). Separate meta-analysis of each phase effect and direct comparisons between them yielded results that were largely consistent with the model. This evidence included between-phase double dissociations that were consistent with the model, such as encoding > maintenance contrast showing some DAN, but no FPCN, regions, and maintenance > encoding contrast showing the reverse, that is, some FPCN, but no DAN, regions. Two closely juxtaposed regions that are members of the DAN and FPCN, such as inferior frontal junction versus caudal prefrontal cortex and superior versus inferior intraparietal sulcus, showed a high degree of functional differentiation. Although all regions identified in the present study were already identified in previous WM studies, this study uniquely enhances our understating of their roles by clarifying their network membership and specific associations with different WM phases.

In the present discussion paper, we reviewed eight functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) papers to determine whether there are sex differences in brain activity during long-term memory retrieval. The objectives were: 1) to compare the experimental parameters in studies reporting significant versus null long-term memory sex differences, and 2) to identify whether specific brain regions were associated with sex differences during long-term memory. The following experimental parameters were extracted from each paper: the number of participants, the average age of participants, stimulus type(s), whether or not performance was matched, whether or not sex differences were reported, the type of between-subject statistical test used, and the contrast(s) employed. The particular experimental parameters employed in each study did not appear to determine whether sex differences were observed, as there were sex differences in all eight studies. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was conducted to identify brain regions activated to a greater degree by females than males or males than females. This ALE meta-analysis revealed sex differences (male > female) in the lateral prefrontal cortex, visual processing regions, parahippocampal cortex, and the cerebellum. This constitutes compelling evidence that there are substantial sex differences in brain activity during long-term memory retrieval. More broadly, the present findings question the widespread practice of collapsing across sex in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

Deficits in working memory are linked to the risk of onset of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, and there is a significant temporal overlap between the peak of first episode psychosis risk and working memory maturation. In order to characterize the normal working memory functional maturation process through this critical phase of cognitive development we conducted a systematic review and coordinate based meta-analyses of all the available primary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0382) that mapped WM function in healthy adolescents (10-17 years) and young adults (18-30 years). Activation Likelihood Estimation analyses across all WM tasks revealed increased activation with increasing subject age in the middle frontal gyrus (BA6) bilaterally, the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the left precuneus and left inferior parietal gyri (BA7; 40). Decreased activation with increasing age was found in the right superior frontal (BA8), left junction of postcentral and inferior parietal (BA3/40), and left limbic cingulate gyrus (BA31). These results suggest that brain activation during adolescence increased with age principally in higher order cortices, part of the core working memory network, while reductions were detected in more diffuse and potentially more immature neural networks. Understanding the process by which the brain and its cognitive functions mature through healthy adulthood may provide us with new clues to understanding the vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have probed the neural basis of this emotional enhancement effect on encoding processes, while relatively fewer studies have examined retrieval. Neuroimaging meta-analysis methods can summarize the brain regions associated with emotional episodic memory that are consistently activated across multiple studies. A previous ALE (Activation Likelihood Estimation) meta-analysis identified consistent activations associated with successful encoding of episodic emotional memory in the amygdala, hippocampus, and in multiple neocortical regions (Murty et al., 2010). However, since that study, meta-analysis methods have improved, and many new relevant neuroimaging studies have been published. Moreover, although qualitative reviews have summarized brain activations related to the successful retrieval of emotional episodic memory, no corresponding quantitative meta-analyses have yet been reported. Here we conducted neuroimaging meta-analyses of successful emotional memory encoding and rretrieval using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Relevant neuroimaging studies reporting whole-brain fMRI correlates of successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory were selected for analysis. For successful emotional memory encoding, SDM activations were found bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), bilaterally in visual processing regions (middle temporal, gyrus, fusiform gyrus and occipital cortex) and bilaterally in the temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, putamen, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri. In contrast to the prior meta-analysis, SDM activations were not observed in the inferior frontal gyrus or in parietal regions. For successful emotional episodic memory retrieval, SDM activations were observed in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, and left entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex and right middle temporal gyrus), prefrontal cortex (bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right frontal pole) and other regions in the left hemisphere including the temporal pole, insula, putamen, angular gyrus, and parietal opercular cortex. Considerable overlap was observed between the encoding and retrieval meta-analysis maps in the medial temporal lobe (bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex), visual processing regions (bilateral occipital cortex, right middle temporal gyrus), and other regions including the left orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, left putamen, left pallidum, and left temporal pole. The current findings add to current understanding of the role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions in the successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory, clarify and provide an important summary of the current literature in this area, and have implications for current theories of emotional episodic memory encoding and retrieval.

Despite accumulating neuroimaging studies with the n-back task and children, its neural representation is still unclear. fMRI studies that used the n-back were compiled, and data from children up to 15 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0260) were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. Results show concordance in frontoparietal regions recognized for their role in working memory as well as regions not typically highlighted as part of the working memory network, such as the insula. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental methodology and potential contribution to developmental theories of cognition.
