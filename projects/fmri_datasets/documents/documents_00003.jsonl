We show that most human pathogenic RNA viruses form multiple, cocirculating lineages with low turnover rates. These lineages appear to be largely noncompeting and occupy distinct epidemiological niches that are not regionally or seasonally defined, and their persistence appears to stem from limited outbreaks in small communities so that only a small fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any time. However, due to globalization, interaction and competition between lineages might increase, potentially leading to increased diversification and pathogenicity. Thus, endemic viruses appear to merit global attention with respect to the prevention of future pandemics. \n  \nMany pathogenic viruses are endemic among human populations and can cause a broad variety of diseases, some potentially leading to devastating pandemics. How virus populations maintain diversity and what selective pressures drive population turnover is not thoroughly understood. We conducted a large-scale phylodynamic analysis of 27 human pathogenic RNA viruses spanning diverse life history traits, in search of unifying trends that shape virus evolution. For most virus species, we identify multiple, cocirculating lineages with low turnover rates. These lineages appear to be largely noncompeting and likely occupy semiindependent epidemiological niches that are not regionally or seasonally defined. Typically, intralineage mutational signatures are similar to interlineage signatures. The principal exception are members of the family   Picornaviridae,   for which mutations in capsid protein genes are primarily lineage defining. Interlineage turnover is slower than expected under a neutral model, whereas intralineage turnover is faster than the neutral expectation, further supporting the existence of independent niches. The persistence of virus lineages appears to stem from limited outbreaks within small communities, so that only a small fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any time. As disparate communities become increasingly connected through globalization, interaction and competition between lineages might increase as well, which could result in changing selective pressures and increased diversification and/or pathogenicity. Thus, in addition to zoonotic events, ongoing surveillance of familiar, endemic viruses appears to merit global attention with respect to the prevention or mitigation of future pandemics. \n \n\n# Body\n \nViruses, ubiquitous across the tree of life, occupy an astounding diversity of ecological niches ( \u2013 ). Viral niches are primarily defined by the behavior and immunity of the respective hosts and are often the subject of deep but narrow investigation ( ,  ). In this work, we sought to uncover common trends at relatively short evolutionary distances by studying the microevolution of human pathogenic RNA viruses. The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that understanding these microevolutionary features is of vital importance not only to forward our understanding of virology, in general, but to inform appropriate public health measures during a pandemic ( ,  ). \n\nViral populations explore their viable sequence space defined by both intrinsic constraints and those imposed by host behavior ( ) through the accumulation of mutations, potentially leading to diversification ( ). A single host species can offer multiple independent niches that are explored by distinct virus subpopulations. Niches can be formed and maintained through regional or seasonal separation. Regional separation of subpopulations has been demonstrated, for example, for yellow fever virus (YFV) ( ,  ). At sufficiently long evolutionary distances, niches can be defined by immunological differences, which enable a viral subpopulation to overcome immune cross-protection, allowing the same host to be infected by multiple subpopulations largely independent of prior infections. This phenomenon has been demonstrated for enteroviruses with many cocirculating serotypes ( ). These immunological niches do not need to be spatially or temporally segregated. \n\nGenerally, niches are not necessarily static entities and can overlap or merge depending on dissemination rates, transmission modes, and other life history traits ( ). When outbreaks are limited to small communities so that only a small fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any time, niches can form that are not regionally or seasonally defined but are still maintained through a combination of spatial and temporal separation at a local scale. Thus, the maintenance of these viral niches is highly sensitive to changes in host behavior. The number and sequence diversity of such lineages depends on constraints intrinsic to viral biology as well as host behavior ( ,  ). For example, there is a sharp contrast between the emergence of immunological niches among measles morbilli virus (MMV) and influenza A virus (IAV) strain H3N2 (named H3N2 here). Through rapid antigenic drift and shift that involve a nonhuman host reservoir, IAV is able to overcome adaptive-immune protection, despite infecting a substantial fraction of the susceptible host population each year ( ). As a consequence, H3N2 goes through phases of stasis, in which neutral evolution and purifying selection are dominant, parallel lineages are established, and population diversity grows. Once the pool of na\u00efve hosts shrinks, the competition between lineages intensifies, resulting in a short phase of strong positive selection that favors one lineage to replace all others ( \u2013 ). In contrast, no such antigenic drift has been observed for MMV, and parallel MMV lineages do not replace each other but, rather, stably coexist ( ,  ). \n\nThe persistence of multiple, coexisting viral lineages implies minimal interlineage competition. When such lineages are maintained through spatial or temporal separation, increased host\u2013host or host\u2013vector contact can result in the merger between and competition among multiple lineages. Climate change can support the spread and mixing of previously separated vectors, which could carry distinct viral lineages. With more vectors, the dissemination rate can rise, decreasing the number of susceptible hosts, and increasing competition globally ( ). This can result in accelerated lineage turnover of human and agricultural pathogens, with the potential for substantial epidemiological and economic impact ( ). \n\nWe sought to identify unifying trends of lineage emergence, persistence, and turnover among human pathogenic RNA viruses and to characterize the niches occupied by these lineages through phylodynamic analysis ( ). Taking advantage of the substantial recent progress in virus genome sequencing ( ), we constructed phylogenetic trees for the genomes of all monopartite human pathogenic RNA viruses for which extensive genome sequence information was available. These phylogenies were employed to assess the selection pressures affecting the evolution of these viruses through an analysis of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (  dN/dS  ), and to estimate the effective population size (  Ne  ) and the census population size (  N  ) for each. The viruses studied here are of clear epidemiological relevance, span a broad variety of life history traits ( ,  ), and thus seem suitable to reveal unifying trends in the microevolution of RNA viruses. Our analysis of these viruses indicates that most form multiple, coexisting, noncompeting lineages which appear to occupy independent niches. \n\n## Results \n  \n### Data Aggregation. \n  \nDespite the substantial progress of the past several years ( ), the available numbers of (nearly) complete genome sequences of human pathogenic RNA viruses differ widely among viral species, with few sequences available for several viruses. In the dataset for the present analysis, we included only those species for which 200 or more (nearly) complete genome sequences, with at least 50 isolated from a human host, were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) virus database ( ) or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( ) ( ). These criteria excluded viruses which are widespread, for example, lyssa rhabdovirus and rubella virus, but for which few (nearly) complete genomes were available, as well as comparatively rare, even if highly pathogenic, viruses including some Ebola virus species (Zaire, but not Reston or Sudan, was included) and Marburg virus. \n  \nPhylogenies of human pathogenic RNA viruses. Schematic depicting the origins and phylogenetic tree topologies of 27 human pathogenic RNA viruses. (  A  ) Placement of each virus in the global phylogeny of RNA viruses (realm Riboviria). The tree topology is from ref.  . Viral groups containing human pathogenic viruses are named in black if containing viruses analyzed in this work, and gray otherwise. The numbers of viral species, for which at least 200 nearly complete genome sequences were available, at least 50 of these isolated from humans, are shown in colored circles (green: monopartite viruses; blue: segmented viruses). (  B  ) Speciation of viral families or orders. (  C  ) Diversification within species. Trees for species are scaled to the same distance from the root to the most distal leaf and are grafted on the tree scaffold with arbitrary branch lengths for speciation but respecting topology. \n  \nOnly monopartite RNA viruses were considered, in order to exclude potential effects of segment reassortment and enable the construction of a single, unambiguous phylogeny. This restriction excluded six species with many genomes available: three influenza viruses (A, B, and C), Reovirus, Lassa mammarenavirus, and Dabie bandavirus. We further omitted HIV, given its retrotranscribing replication strategy. Altogether, our dataset included 26 monopartite virus species. We added IAV H3N2 to this group (with a phylogeny constructed from hemagglutinin) as a thoroughly studied reference virus ( ,  ,  ). The 27 viruses analyzed here cover a broad variety of viral lifestyles and ecological constraints and have been subject to varied countermeasures, including vaccination ( ). This diversity enables the exploration of potential unifying trends of viral lineage turnover and niche formation. \n\nSequences were aligned using MAFFT ( ), and, with the exception of SARS-CoV-2 and H3N2, for which the large number of sequences necessitated an iterative strategy, phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE ( ) (see   and   for details). For most of viruses, the resulting trees included several large, clearly distinguishable clades ( ) that, in some cases, corresponded to known serotypes or genotypes (for example, Dengue virus, DENV, serotypes 1 to 4). \n\n\n### Low Rates of Lineage Turnover among Human RNA Viruses. \n  \nThe major virus clades and the smaller lineages contained within them are subject to turnover whereby an older lineage goes extinct, being gradually replaced by individuals from a newer lineage. Trees with high turnover rates are often described as \u201ccactus\u201d- or \u201cladder\u201d-like, and, in the limit of extreme turnover, as \u201ccaterpillar\u201d trees, whereas those with low turnover are often described as \u201cbush\u201d-like, with ultrametric trees representing the limit of no turnover ( ,  ). In an effort to explicitly measure lineage turnover [without relying solely on global measures such as coalescence rate ( ), which is also estimated], we first sought to establish how many isolates, and distributed on the tree in what way, constitute a lineage. This information is important, in large part, because varying substitution rates across the tree complicate the estimation of global lineage turnover ( ,  ). We defined lineages as monophyletic groups of sequences separated by periods (branches of the tree) with apparently different substitution rates and within which the sequencing date and the distance to the tree root are significantly correlated (see   and   for details). Lineages cannot be defined in this way to encompass all sequences, and   shows the fraction of sequences included in correlated lineages for each virus. Arguably, significantly different substitution rates mark different selective environments and may reflect movement into distinct epidemiological niches. Because there are no apparent periods of different substitution rates within each lineage and, consequently, high-confidence date-constrained genealogical trees with a single substitution rate could be fit for each (see below), we denote these \u201cgenealogical lineages\u201d (GLs). \n\nMultiple GLs were identified in this manner for most viruses ( ), as illustrated in   for the three lineages of enterovirus D (EVD). For human betacoronavirus 1 (BCoV1), Ebola Zaire (Ebola), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), H3N2, SARS-CoV-2, and Zika virus (ZIKV), the majority of the phylogeny comprised a single GL. Thus, the entire population of each of these viruses might occupy a single epidemiological niche at any point in time (which may be subject to rapid lineage turnover as is the case for H3N2). For Mumps rubulavirus (MRV) and YFV, the GLs identified were not large enough for subsequent analysis. When interpreting our observation of a single GL for Ebola, it should be noted that more than half of the Ebola isolates stem from the 2014\u20132016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea ( ), the common assumption being that each individual Ebola outbreak stems from an individual zoonotic spillover event ( ). \n  \nStable coexistence of lineages among human pathogenic RNA viruses. (  A  ) EVD tree colored to represent the location of the three GLs. (  B  ) Distance to the tree root vs. date of isolation for EVD. Distance is scaled by the maximum for any sequence within a correlated clade, and the   x   axis is bounded by the minimum/maximum date of isolation for any such sequence. (  C  ) The fraction of isolates within each correlated clade (and excluding isolates that did not belong to any correlated clade) computed over a sliding window containing the nearest 5% of all isolates indexed by sequencing date (  Top  ) and root distance (  Bottom  , where date* represents the date of isolation corresponding to each sequence in an alternative phylogeny where the date of isolation for each sequence exactly corresponds to the distance to the root for that sequence). (  D  ) The mean Shannon entropy for the correlated-clade distribution respecting the sequencing date (  y   axis,  ) and root distance (  x   axis,  ). Dashed line displays  . \n  \nHaving identified the virus GLs, we quantified the extent of lineage turnover using the Shannon entropy of the GL distribution over time,   S  , as well as traveling up the tree from root to leaf,   S  . These measures are independent of the timescale over which individual GLs persist and allow us to compare whether the phylogenetic structure of GLs (  S  ) reflects their distribution over time (  S  ). For this analysis, only sequences included within a GL were considered. First, sliding windows (indexed over   j  ) containing the closest 5% of all isolates to the specified date,  , (from the date of the earliest isolated sequence to the latest) or distance to the tree root,  , were established, and the GL distribution within each window was obtained ( ). Next, the probability that a sequence,   x  , within each window belongs to the   i  th GL was computed:  . The Shannon entropy of the GL distribution was then calculated using log base   N   equal to the number of GLs identified within the tree (and yielding a maximum value of one), \n\nFinally, the mean over all windows was computed for each tree:   ( ). A mean entropy near zero corresponds to a phylogeny composed of clades that rapidly displace one another (although effects of sampling bias cannot be excluded). A mean entropy near one corresponds to a phylogeny in which all clades are uniformly distributed at every time point. We observed   in all but one case (hepatitis D virus [HDV]), indicating that entropy is greater than that expected from analysis of the tree structure with no known dates of isolation. This observation, coupled with the generally high mean entropy, suggests that most of the analyzed viruses evolve with low rates of lineage turnover. \n\nTo further quantify lineage turnover, we constructed date-constrained genealogical trees. As suggested above, GLs are separated by periods (branches of the tree) with apparently different substitution rates. These branches are often deep within the tree and are sparsely populated with leaves (if at all), making the assignment of a global model for substitution rates statistically dubious and highlighting the importance of rates inferred for individual GLs. Date-constrained trees were produced using a least-square distance approach based on the date of isolation for each sequence ( ). A mutation rate and the date of the last common ancestor (LCA) were estimated for all global trees and each GL individually ( ). Samples without a known date of isolation introduce additional uncertainty into the calculation and can result in future-dated portions of the genealogical tree (see   and   for details). GLs tend to accumulate over time, with few if any extinction events ( ). Note that the apparent decline of parallel GLs for many viruses in recent years (\u223c2016 to present) is most likely a sampling artifact, although, in principle, such decline could also point to a change in GL dynamics. These trends are further indicative of low lineage turnover and suggestive of minimal competition among GLs. Thus, each GL is likely to occupy a distinct niche, and we sought to identify the factors that shape and maintain these niches.   lists the number of GLs per virus species and other key parameters obtained during the analysis described below. \n  \nGLs of human pathogenic RNA viruses throughout time. (  A  ) Mutation rates (substitutions per site per year) for all main and GL phylogenetic trees used to construct genealogical trees (  Top  ). Time to LCA in years from 2021 for all main and GL populations used to construct genealogical trees (  Bottom  ). (  B  ) Number of GLs per virus species circulating at the same time, based on the genealogical trees for each GL. For unannotated samples within a GL, the sampling date was estimated based on the date of the MRCA and root distance. \n  \n\n### Most Virus Lineages Are Not Regionally or Seasonally Defined. \n  \nPerhaps the simplest explanation for the existence of distinct niches would be regional separation. To assess the role played by regionality, we examined whether isolates within a single GL clustered by region. The great circle map distance between pairs of isolates within each GL and between pairs of GLs was computed to retrieve the mean intra- and inter-GL distance, respectively (see   and   for details). Given that GLs do not span the entire phylogeny for all viruses, were defined algorithmically without the incorporation of metadata beyond the date of isolation, and typically include a small number of isolates, we additionally examined the regionality of larger clades, usually defined by serotype or genotype (\u201cmanual lineages\u201d [MLs]; see   and   for details). \n\nThe ratio of the interlineage to intralineage map distances is expected to be greater than unity for regionally defined GLs or MLs, and near or below unity for those lineages that are not regionally defined ( ). For most viruses analyzed, niches do not appear to be regionally defined, with a few notable exceptions ( ). In particular, YFV is known to split into three regional lineages (East/Central Africa, West Africa, and South America), although the underlying mechanisms for this separation, especially between the African lineages, are not well understood ( ,  ). Similarly, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) displays regionality, although, in this case, the separation seems to be incomplete ( ). West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 1 can be found globally, whereas all other lineages are regional ( ). However, evidence of the local coexistence of multiple WNV subtypes ( ) indicates that additional WNV niches not linked to regionality might exist. HDV displays weak regionality that might be determined by its helper virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), on which HDV depends for reproduction. The interplay between HDV and HBV genotypes is not yet well understood ( ). Ebola outbreaks show a clear regional structure, which is due to de novo spillover events for each outbreak as well as successful containment measures ( ). Some, but not all, GLs for Dengue virus (DENV), enterovirus A (EVA), and enterovirus B (EVB) may be regionally defined ( ). Thus, while common, regionality does not appear to explain the existence of most apparent niches, although this does not imply an absence of spatial separation of localized outbreaks. \n\nSimilar to regionality, seasonality could potentially support niche formation. Although the temporal resolution of our analysis was limited by the amount of metadata available and the precision with which dates of isolation are specified, we found no evidence that seasonality plays a role in lineage maintenance within viral species. We observed no biannual or longer global periodicity of any GLs, but rather a continuous distribution of lineages through time ( ), although shorter temporal patterns are likely for respiratory viruses ( ). \n\nGLs could represent localized outbreaks (phases of enhanced virus spread) whereby a virus infects only a minute fraction of the global susceptible population at any given time. Under these conditions, even lineages which do not form distinct immunological niches and do not admit near-simultaneous infection can coexist within short distances of one another. Infection or vaccination leading to lifelong immunity, as observed, for example, in the case of MMV or MRV ( ), can support the emergence of localized outbreaks. In these cases, na\u00efve hosts are born and are not vaccinated, so that a local community of susceptible hosts emerges. Given sufficient evolutionary distance, lineages can become so diverse antigenically that they form different serotypes, which induce weak to no cross-immunity against each other and thus admit near-simultaneous infection. This pattern has been reported for some picornaviruses ( ). In the case of zoonotic viruses, distinct lineages can originate when the same virus species is introduced from different animal reservoirs, which could support ongoing diversification and lineage turnover not observed in the human population. This is how some orthohepevirus A (OHVA) GLs ( ) and possibly some TBEV (Tick Borne Encephalitis Virus) and WNV GLs ( ,  ) could originate. However, even in this case, the maintenance of multiple niches with low turnover within human populations requires spatiotemporal or immunological separation. Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the apparent coexistence of noncompeting GLs, we sought to explore lineage-defining mutational signatures and to establish whether significant differences existed between the distributions of mutations within and between lineages. \n\n\n### Selective Pressures Acting on Human RNA Viruses. \n  \nSelective processes are often categorized as diversifying, positive, or purifying, in contrast to neutral evolution via genetic drift ( \u2013 ). We sought to probe the selective pressures involved in human pathogenic virus evolution by estimating the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (  dN/dS  ), a gauge of protein-level selection ( ,  ). Given that different genes are subject to distinct selective constraints and pressures, the   dN/dS   value was estimated separately for each viral protein-coding gene ( ). Seeking to identify defining features of lineage emergence and maintenance, we would ideally estimate   dN/dS   across deep and shallow portions of each phylogeny separately. However, because most GLs antedated modern sequencing technologies, and, therefore, few samples located near the root were available, this approach was not feasible. To partially compensate for this lack of data, we compared   dN/dS   ratios for whole trees, which include deep branches connecting GLs, with those computed over each GL and ML (which are typically larger) individually (see   and   for details). The   dN/dS   estimates for whole trees ranged between 0.02 and 0.5 for most virus protein-coding genes, which is indicative of strong to moderate purifying selection, in line with previous results ( ) ( ). The few virus genes with elevated   dN/dS   ratios encode proteins that are either presented on the virion surface, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) glycoprotein (G) and M-2 (\u223c3.5\u00d7 above the species mean   dN/dS  ), or human metapneumovirus (HMPV) SH and G (\u223c3\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 above the species mean, respectively) ( ), or are involved in interactions with the host immune system, for example, MMV V protein ( ) (\u223c4\u00d7 above the species mean) ( ). These proteins are likely to experience positive selection, as described, for example, for HMPV G, where sites under positive selection were identified in the putative ectodomain ( ). Elevated   dN/dS   values were also observed for some very short proteins, for example, the 6k peptide of DENV ( ). However, such observations are sensitive to statistical artifacts and should be interpreted with caution. For OHVA ORF3, the   dN/dS   estimate was \u223c4\u00d7 above the species mean (0.3;  ), suggesting that this gene, which encodes an ion channel, plays a role in host adaptation following zoonosis ( ). \n\nNext, we computed   dN/dS   for each GL and ML individually ( , respectively). Despite considerable differences in size, generally, the results for GLs and MLs were comparable. For 12 of the 27 viruses studied (members of the order   Mononegavirales  , HMPV, HRSV, human respirovirus 3, MMV, and MRV; some flaviviruses ZIKV, YFV, TBEV, and YFV; HDV; MERS; and CHIKV), the   dN/dS   estimates for individual proteins as well as the mean for the whole tree differed little relative to the respective estimates for individual lineages ( ), with no indication of how selective pressures might have varied over time for any genes. In contrast, the GLs of enteroviruses (EVA-D) show elevated   dN/dS  , mainly among capsid proteins ( ). Although frequent recombination among enteroviruses necessitates interpreting these results with caution ( ), this finding, coupled with the observation that mutations in enterovirus capsid protein genes appear to be the primary lineage-defining features (see below), suggests a substantial change in the selective pressure acting on the capsid proteins between the periods of lineage emergence and subsequent maintenance. Notably, OHVA lineages show similarly elevated   dN/dS   for domain of unknown function 3729 (DUF3729) (up to 0.4) and ORF3   dN/dS   (up to 0.3, which is also elevated relative to the species mean as discussed above) ( ). Both these genes are likely to be involved in host adaptation following zoonosis ( ,  ). Further, a twofold to fivefold increase in mean   dN/dS   was detected for DENV, WNV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) GLs across most genes relative to the complete phylogeny ( ). The interpretation of genome-wide elevation of   dN/dS   in GLs is more challenging and depends on whether the GL is newly emergent, possibly reflecting a period of rapid host adaptation and intense positive selection ( ,  ). Given the distant dates predicted for the LCAs for these GLs and lack of lineage turnover, reduced selective pressure moving from stronger purifying selection toward neutral drift appears more likely. Overall,   dN/dS   analysis revealed little about potentially differing selective pressures acting within and between GLs, despite the apparent differences in substitution rates critical to the definition of the GLs themselves (as discussed above). \n\n\n### Intralineage and Interlineage Mutational Signatures. \n  \nGene-scale   dN/dS   analysis is often unable to uncover positive selection acting on specific sites or neighborhoods, which can occur in widely different backgrounds, from neutral drift to strong purifying selection ( ). Identification of individual positively selected mutations can provide additional insight into differences between the evolutionary contexts of GL emergence and subsequent maintenance. Multiple, parallel nonsynonymous mutations comprise the most obvious indication of site-wise positive selection. With the prominent exception of SARS-CoV-2, for which we have previously identified up to 100 sites with recurrent amino acid replacements that are likely subject to positive selection ( ), too few recurrent amino acid substitutions were detected for comparable analysis in the remaining viruses analyzed here, despite being the species with the largest number of genome sequences available. \n\nGiven the infeasibility of the direct, site-specific approach, we performed a genomic neighborhood analysis to compare interlineage and intralineage mutational signatures. First, amino acid sites were labeled according to three categories of amino acid substitutions ( ; see   and   for details): 1) multiple, deep (MD) substitutions which are \u201clineage defining,\u201d being conserved in at least 90% of the samples within at least two GLs, but represented by different amino acid residues in each of these GLs\u2014for example, consider the third amino acid of the CHIKV ORF gp1, 97% of the sequences in GL 1 contain a serine in that site, whereas 96% of the sequences in GL2 contain a proline in that site; 2) multiple, shallow (MS) substitutions occurring on multiple, independent occasions across GLs; and 3) all shallow (AS) substitutions occurring at least once within a GL, representing all \u201crecent\u201d events. We then computed site densities for each of these three categories over a sliding window of 101 amino acid sites, respecting protein boundaries. \n  \nMutational signatures in human pathogenic RNA viruses vary little with tree depth. (  A  ) Illustration of three amino acid site classes considered: 1) MD (red), 2) MS (yellow), and 3) AS (blue). Dashed circle represents deep, singular mutations which are excluded from this analysis. (  B  ) Pearson correlation coefficient between site densities for all pairs of site classes across the genome computed over a moving average of 101 amino acids respecting mature peptide boundaries. Rows are sorted by the first column subtracted from the third column. (  C  ) Log ratio of the mean site density across the specified peptide relative to the whole genome for select peptides. Bars are bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles of simulated data drawn from the binomial distribution with   n,   total number of sites across the genome, trials of probability   P,   length of peptide/length of genome. RVA|P* represents the union of peptides P2-C, P-3A, and protease-3C. \n  \nWe then examined the correlation between the site densities in these categories of amino acid substitutions across the genome (  and  ). In most cases, there was a strong, positive correlation between all three categories of amino acid substitutions, indicating that most genomic regions are subject to similar selection pressures during interlineage and intralineage evolution, with several notable exceptions ( ). For enteroviruses, we observed an elevated MD site density within capsid proteins (VP1-4;  ), suggesting that capsid mutations are primarily lineage defining, but become less frequent once an epidemiological niche is established and occupied. This trend is consistent with the historical classification of enterovirus lineages by serotype, which is determined by the antigenic properties of the capsid proteins ( ). As mentioned above, frequent intraspecies and interspecies recombination among all four types of enteroviruses requires caution when interpreting these results ( ). This trend was similarly observed for the capsid proteins of the picornavirus Parechovirus A (PeVA) (VP0, VP1C, and VP1D;  ). \n\nElevated MD and MS substitution densities were observed for HRSV G, potentially suggesting multiple residues evolving under positive selection throughout the entire course of evolution (including both lineage emergence and maintenance) of this immunologically exposed protein ( ). Both MD and MS substitution densities are also increased in DENV NS2A and CHIKV nsp3. DENV NS2A is involved in virus replication and assembly and shows viroporin-like properties ( ,  ). A detailed functional understanding of CHIKV nsp3 is lacking, although this protein is known to be part of the replication complex and is also involved in modulating the host cell\u2019s antiviral response ( ). In line with the observation of elevated   dN/dS   in for OHVA DUF3729 in GLs compared to the whole population, MS substitution densities are elevated in this gene ( ), suggesting that this poorly characterized protein contains multiple positively selected residues. These residues might have played a role in relatively recent host adaptation, but were not necessarily involved in the emergence of multiple lineages. The high MD substitution density observed for large human delta antigen (LHDAg) might result from statistical fluctuations given the short length (20 aa) of this peptide and should be interpreted with caution. As observed for the   dN/dS   analysis, we found few mutational signatures, which would shed light on different selection pressures acting within and between GLs. These observations seem to suggest that, although the tempo is variable, the mode of molecular evolution is broadly conserved from the deep to the shallow portions of each phylogeny, thus spanning considerable evolutionary distances. \n\n\n### Effective Population Size of Human Pathogenic RNA Viruses. \n  \nAnother tool to indirectly assess the selective pressures shaping a phylogeny is to estimate the effective population size (  Ne  ), which defines the timescale of population turnover across generations and thus can reveal major evolutionary events, including population bottlenecks ( ). Assuming an evolutionary model, such as Wright\u2013Fisher ( ) or Moran ( ), one can estimate the number of individuals per generation (that is,   Ne  ) required for the observed rate of turnover in an idealized population. In what follows, we refer to \u201cselection\u201d as the sum of evolutionary pressures that promote lineage turnover. Although the background could vary from strong purifying selection to neutral drift, the occurrence of lineage turnover implicitly assumes some degree of positive selection in most scenarios. In the context of lineage turnover, under strong selection,   Ne   is small, whereas lack of competition leads to larger   Ne   values over time ( ).   Ne   can be inferred from the coalescence rate (  Cr  ) estimated for any genealogical tree ( ,  ,  ):   where   t   is the viral generation time (the time in days a virus needs to complete a transmission cycle from human to human). This expression enables a measurement of diversity and strength of selection among phylogenies represented by a single GL (e.g., H3N2, SARS-CoV-2), as well. Further, the census population size   N   (individuals present at each generation) can be estimated as  , where   D   is the number of yearly cases estimated. The   N/Ne   ratio may be used to quantify lineage turnover, where   N/Ne   \u226b 1 indicates population bottlenecks, and   N/Ne   \u2248 1 suggests stable population diversity ( ). As tree topology, and hence   Ne   estimates, depend on selection strength and sampling effort ( ,  ), we directly assessed the effect of sampling by randomly drawing up to either 10 or 100 samples per year, with three replicates each, for H3N2 and EVA as representative viruses with fast and slow turnover, respectively. We then used these reduced ensembles of isolates for genealogical tree construction (see   and   for details; mutation rates and time of LCA are shown in  ). We constructed two additional ensembles for each virus, composed of the same number of isolates selected above, this time maximizing the sequence diversity (as measured by the hamming distance between alignment rows; see   and   for details). As a result, we obtained six trees evenly sampled over time (3\u00d7, e10, and e100) as well as two maximally diverse subtrees of the same size (d10 and d100) for both H3N2 and EVA. \n\nWe calculated the coalescence rates for all complete trees and for the H3N2 and EVA subtrees using the PACT package ( ) ( ) and estimated   Ne   ( ). The   Ne   estimation was not performed for some zoonotic viruses, including TBEV and WNV, for which the generation time could not be reliably estimated.   N/Ne   ratios were calculated based on the best estimates of   Ne   for complete trees and those obtained after even and diverse sampling (H3N2 and EVA) ( ). The estimated   Ne   values span more than two orders of magnitude, with H3n2 \u201ceven\u201d 10 (H3N2e10) and EVD representing the extremes ( ;   Ne   of around 400 and 270,000, respectively). Sampling was found to have a major effect on the estimates. The   Ne   estimates for EVA d100, d10, e100, and the whole tree were similar, whereas EVA e10 was about an order of magnitude lower. It should be noted that EVA e100 contained most sequences present in the whole tree. This trend was even more pronounced for H3N2, where the   Ne   estimates for d100, d10, and the whole tree were similar, whereas those for e10 and e100 were several orders of magnitude lower. It is first important to note that the estimates were not sensitive to the number of sequences present in the phylogeny, as illustrated by the equivalency of d10 and the whole phylogeny for both viruses, indicating that the differences observed between e10 and e100 and the whole phylogeny are not merely methodological artifacts. However, the estimate is sensitive to sampling, and, as could be expected, this sensitivity is more pronounced for viruses with fast lineage turnover. While perhaps unsurprising, this finding implies that   Ne   has been, and likely continues to be in this work, underestimated due to data limitations for most viruses and H3N2 in particular. \n  \nEstimation of effective population sizes for human pathogenic RNA viruses. (  A  )   Ne   estimated for genealogical trees. Bars represent varying generation time   t   for each virus ranging between 0.5 and 5 times the value corresponding to the filled circle. For H3N2 and EVA,   Ne   estimates for evenly sampled trees (up to 10 or 100 samples per year, e10 and e100, respectively) and diverse sampled trees (d10 and d100) are also displayed. (  B  )   N/Ne   ratios, where   N   is the census population. Bars represent varying   N   between 0.5 and 5 times the value corresponding to the filled circle.   N   and   t   estimates are shown in  . As in   C  ,   N/Ne   estimates are shown for evenly and diverse sampled trees for EVA and H3N2. Color code is as in   C  . (  C  )   Ne   (with generation time   t   fixed to one for   Ne   calculation for all trees) for simulated trees with varied selection strength and sampling density (  Ne   is represented by the circle area). Sampling density (as multifurcation multiplicity) varied from two to six. Selection strength was simulated by positioning new leaves each iteration at the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, or 95th percentile of the root distance distribution for the entire tree (see   for details). (  D  ) Examples of simulated trees with varied selection strength and sampling density. \n  \nTo illustrate the potential equivalency of reduced sampling and increased selection on   Ne   estimation, we simulated an ensemble of genealogical trees under a simple phenomenological model. Trees were iteratively constructed through the addition of clades representing local sequencing efforts. Increased sequencing efforts were modeled by changing the number of sequences in each clade from two to six. Increased selection strength was modeled by changing the placement of these clades on the tree, relative to the root, from the prior iteration. A root distance threshold was set to be the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, or 95th percentile of the root distance distribution for all leaves at the prior iteration, with higher thresholds corresponding to new isolates being placed farther from the tree root and representing increased selection (  and  ). Although selection and undersampling result in qualitatively different tree topologies ( ), their effects cannot be disentangled from   Ne   analysis alone. Furthermore, sensitivity to undersampling is more pronounced under high selection than under low selection (  and  ). These effects must be considered when evaluating the expectation that genetic diversity (and hence   Ne  ) plateaus earlier in a growing census population   N   when selection is strong ( ). This challenge is reflected in the damped increase of   Ne   from H3N2 e10 to e100 when compared to the increase from EVA e10 to e100 (approximately fourfold and eightfold, respectively;  ). \n\nKeeping these sensitivities in mind, we proceeded to examine the   N/Ne   ratios. High   N/Ne   ratios can be an indicator of population bottlenecks. The highest   N/Ne   ratio was observed for H3N2e10 (e100 was similar); in contrast, the estimate for the whole phylogeny was about 200-fold lower ( ), within the range of the majority of the other viruses. Thus, sampling efforts can substantially affect the interpretation of the   N/Ne   estimation, moving H3N2 from an outlier associated with extreme bottlenecks to typical behavior. As discussed above, it has been well established that H3N2 is subject to pronounced population bottlenecks as a result of alternating periods of stasis and rapid host adaptation ( \u2013 ). However, the results presented here emphasize that, on shorter timescales, the transmission dynamics of local outbreaks play a larger role in determining the extent of the diversity of the H3N2 population ( ), as was the case for the majority of viruses studied in this work. BCoV1 also demonstrated a high   N/Ne   ratio, within the range of H3N2 e10 and e100 ( ). Although this observation could simply result from insufficient sampling, given the high incidence of this virus ( ), it might point to pronounced population bottlenecks during the evolution of the BCoV1 population (although not of comparable magnitude to those for H3N2; see below). In contrast, other viruses seem to experience less severe bottlenecks and maintain greater genetic diversity (e.g., MRV and enteroviruses A, C, D). The low   N/Ne   values for MERS, ZIKV, and CHIKV likely result from an underestimation of   N   due to large animal reservoirs that might impact estimates of   N   for H3N2 as well. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation, albeit not statistically significant, between   N/Ne   estimates and the extent of lineage turnover as quantified by the Shannon entropy ( ). This trend is likely perturbed by uncertainty in estimating   N  , and removing CHIKV slightly improves the correlation ( ). \n\nWhereas insufficient sampling can lead to an underestimation of both   N   and   Ne  , the complete unavailability of genomes from premodern periods can, perhaps counterintuitively, lead to an overestimation of   Ne  . As discussed above, GLs are separated by periods (branches of the tree) with apparently different substitution rates. These branches are often deep within the tree topology and sparsely populated with leaves (if at all), making the assignment of a global model for substitution rates statistically dubious. This can result in inaccurate deep branch lengths for genealogical trees and substantially change the predicted date for the LCA. This date, as well as the predicted dates of other deep nodes, is used to estimate the effective population size. Given these limitations, we sought to establish a lower bound for the effective population size, which still preserves all GLs, through the construction of truncated global genealogical trees or \u201cgrafted trees.\u201d The LCA of each grafted tree is set to the LCA of the oldest GL, and the remaining GLs are connected to this (multifurcated) root through branches preserving the LCA of each respective GL (see   and   or   for details). We proceeded to estimate Ne for each grafted tree as well as for each GL separately ( ). By construction,   Ne   estimates for grafted trees are generally significantly smaller than those for complete trees and larger than those for individual GLs. Notably, the   Ne   estimate for H3N2 (which is represented by a single GL) is the second-highest value observed (after rhinovirus A) among the viruses studied when this lower bound is considered. This counterintuitive finding emphasizes another facet of the sensitivity of   Ne   estimation to data availability. \n\nThese sensitivities are evidently greater within individual GLs, which represent only a subset of the viral diversity for each species. These limitations notwithstanding, in an effort to characterize lineage turnover within individual GLs, we analyzed skyline plots representing the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of all clades present at a given time point and diversity within the population over time (as measured by the average time for any two isolates to coalesce, that is, to find their most recent common ancestor) for individual GLs and the complete population ( ). The average population diversity can be displayed as the mean diversity per year ( ). Populations with high turnover, such as H3N2, show a low average diversity per year, whereas those with low turnover are characterized by high diversity. In general, the skyline plots and mean diversity values for complete phylogenies correspond well to   Ne   and   N/Ne   estimations, supporting slow lineage turnover for most of the viruses analyzed. For example, H3N2 displays \u223c4\u00d7 and \u223c8\u00d7 lower mean diversity per year compared to BCoV1 and ZIKV, respectively. This observation suggests BCoV1, despite having high   Ne   and   N/Ne   values, has a slower population turnover compared to H3N2. Of note is that evidence of high intra-GL turnover was obtained for a few GLs (as demonstrated by a mean diversity in the range of H3N2 or BCoV1). The two principal examples are HRSV GL2 and Norwalk GL3 ( ). The majority of GLs show mean diversity within the range of viral populations with low turnover, and individual GLs generally display lower diversity than each respective whole population ( ). Although it is expected that any subpopulation has a lower diversity than the larger population from which it is selected, a higher intra-GL turnover rate relative to the inter-GL turnover might additionally lower diversity within individual GLs. In the next section, we demonstrate that inter-GL turnover is substantially nonneutral, further supporting our conclusion on the existence of independent environmental and epidemiological niches among pathogenic RNA viruses. \n\n\n### Significant Deviations from Neutrality Confirm Noncompeting Niches. \n  \nIn principle, neutral evolution can yield multiple, coexisting lineages. Although, per the definition proposed above, GLs cannot emerge within a phylogeny resulting from an evolutionary process with a constant substitution rate, neutral processes could result in trees qualitatively similar to those of the genealogical trees inferred for the viruses analyzed here. To explicitly demonstrate the deviation from neutrality of these viral evolutionary histories, we simulated trees under a neutral branching process [Yule\u2013Harding ( ,  )] and shallowly subsampled these, to reflect the fact that efficient sequencing technologies were unavailable (for most viruses) for the majority of the period between the present and the predicted date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) (see   for details). For each virus, and each real and simulated tree (which has the same number of leaves as the respective real tree), the number of parallel branches from the root to the tree tips was tabulated, and the date corresponding to the deepest leaves was estimated ( ). In order to probe the coalescence rate among, rather than within, extant lineages, the period from the root to the deepest leaves was further examined. The number of branches from the deepest leaves back toward the root was then fit to a power law model ( ; see   for details). \n  \nProbing pathogenic RNA virus evolution for neutrality. (  A  ) The number of parallel branches in the genealogical tree for the (subsampled) Norwalk virus from the root (188 BCE) to the tree tips. The red line indicates the position of the deepest leaves. (  Inset  ) Rescaled so the periods from the root to the deepest leaves and that from the deepest leaves to the tips are evenly displayed; branch count is displayed at each node. (  B  ) The number of parallel branches of Norwalk virus moving from the deepest leaves back to the root overlaid with fitted power-law. (  C  ) The number of parallel branches from deepest leaves to root normalized by the number of leaves in each tree for all simulated and real trees fit to power-laws. Shading identifies median 50% of data and curves identify median. (  D  ) Log-fold change (simulated/real) of the time derivatives for the number of parallel branches evaluated at the root for those viruses with at least two GLs vs. all others. Shading identifies minima, maxima, and the median 50% of data. Curves identify median. Viruses with at least two GLs, but for which the threshold correlation was reduced (from the default 0.8), appear in \u201cOther*.\u201d (  E  ) Log-fold change of the time derivative at the deepest leaves vs. that at the root. Viruses containing two or more GLs with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 or above are displayed in black, and others are shown in gray. \n  \nThe number of parallel branches was generally greater among simulated trees than among the respective viral genealogical trees for the duration of this period ( ). The log-fold difference (simulated/real) in the derivative evaluated at each tree root, which measures the coalescence rate among (rather than within) extant lineages, was positive, indicating that lineage turnover was slower than that under a neutral evolution model. This deviation from neutrality was greater among viruses containing two or more GLs with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 (and disregarding those with a poorer correlation; see   for details) than among other viruses ( ). For most viruses, this log-fold difference was negative when evaluated at the deepest leaves but became positive moving toward the root (  and  ). Of the five viruses (EVB, enterovirus C [EVC], HCV, PeVA, and SARS-CoV-2) for which the log-fold difference evaluated at the root was negative, only one (EVC) contained multiple GLs. Both the EVC and HCV phylogenies are additionally complicated by the need to remove laboratory-related, vaccine-related, or clinical sequences, which do not circulate globally. Recombination among PeVA genotypes ( ) (each with few sequences, leading to poorly correlated GLs) complicates the inference of a complete genealogical tree for this virus as well. As mentioned above, EVB lacks a global genealogical tree and is represented here by a single GL. SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged and constitutes a single GL in its entirety. The log-fold difference for these and other viruses represented by a single GL should be interpreted with caution. For these trees, the deepest leaf is relatively nearer the root, and the portion of the tree studied is much smaller than in other viruses. Furthermore, interlineage turnover (between the single extant lineage and prior, extinct lineages) may not be measurable with these methods. \n\nThus, among the viruses studied here, interlineage turnover is typically slower than the neutral expectation, and intralineage turnover is faster than the neutral expectation (as described for select GLs above;  ). These results are consistent with our interpretation that human pathogenic RNA virus populations are largely organized into stable, coexisting lineages (GLs). Each GL occupies a distinct epidemiological niche, within which competition leads to increased lineage turnover compared to neutrality. In contrast, among the GLs, there is little competition, which leads to decreased lineage turnover relative to neutrality. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere we present a comprehensive phylodynamic analysis of monopartite human pathogenic RNA viruses (and H3N2 hemagglutinin) in an effort to establish global trends in viral evolution in human populations. Despite data limitations, the viruses studied in this work span a wide variety of viral life history characteristics. This lends considerable generality to the study, while making it outside the scope of this work to investigate many features specific to individual lifestyles [for example, intrahost diversity, symptom characteristics, or acute vs. chronic infection ( )]. Given this diversity, the commonalities we observe among the virus phylogenies constructed are notable. Consistent with the conclusions of previous efforts ( ,  ), we observed moderate to strong purifying selection among all viruses. \n\nNearly all virus populations are characterized by low rates of lineage turnover, and most consist of multiple, coexisting GLs, monophyletic groups of sequences separated by periods with apparently different substitution rates. Despite these differing substitution rates,   dN/dS   and genomic neighborhood analysis revealed little about how selective pressures might have differed between the early period of GL formation and the subsequent period defined by persistent coexistence. This lack of resolution seems to suggest that, although the tempo is variable, the mode of molecular evolution is broadly conserved from the deep to the shallow portions of each phylogeny, spanning considerable evolutionary distances. The distribution of lineage-defining mutations across the virus genome is similar to that of shallow, repeated mutations for almost all viruses, indicating that positive selection affects sites in the same neighborhoods during both periods ( ). The lineage-defining role of enterovirus capsid proteins was the principle exception observed, in line with the traditional serotype classification ( ). Other virus proteins with different intralineage and interlineage mutational signatures, which might provide insight into ongoing host and/or vector adaptive evolution, are OHVA DUF3729, DENV NS2A, and CHIKV NSP3. In the case of CHIKV E1-A226V, NSP3 has been demonstrated to play an important role in the adaptation to the vector   Aedes albopictus   ( ). \n\nThe low inter-GL turnover, below the neutral expectation, and broadly stable mutational signatures appear to be indicative of weak, if any, competition among GLs, suggesting that each GL occupies an independent epidemiological niche (  and  ). Such niches could be maintained in a variety of ways, the most obvious possibility being regionality and/or seasonality. Although these factors can explain the persistence of some GLs identified in this work, the majority do not show regional localization, and none display biannual (or more coarse-grained) temporal trends (the limit of time resolution we can reliably detect). At sufficiently large evolutionary distances, niches can be defined by immunological differences, which can overcome immune cross-protection, allowing the same host to be infected by multiple subpopulations largely independent of prior infections, as seems to be the case for picornaviruses and HRSV ( ). These effects are also insufficient to account for the stability of most GLs. We suggest that, in many if not most cases, niches are maintained through a series of localized outbreaks such that only a small fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any given time. Under this scenario, even lineages that do not overcome immune cross-protection can coexist within short distances of one another. Furthermore, extensive environmental transfer or fragmented animal reservoir populations could play a role. Virions that can persist for extended periods of time outside of the (identified) host or vector might maintain the genetic diversity of a lineage during time periods when no active infections from that lineage occur. \n\nAs a result of globalization, disparate communities are becoming increasingly connected, which might lead to increased interaction between previously separated lineages, enhancing between-lineage competition within the viral population. This effect has been demonstrated already for DENV in Thailand, where multiple lineages typically coexist throughout the country, with a well-defined pattern of dissemination. However, within densely populated areas of Bangkok, genomic analysis pointed to increased competition and lineage turnover ( ). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nPhylodynamic analysis revealed multiple cocirculating lineages (GLs) for the majority of human pathogenic RNA viruses, separated by periods of apparently different substitution rates within the phylogeny. The   dN/dS   and genomic neighborhood analysis yielded surprisingly little evidence of different selection pressures acting within and between GLs, suggesting that, whereas the tempo of molecular evolution is variable, its mode is broadly conserved. This slow lineage turnover, below the neutral expectation, suggests each GL occupies an independent epidemiological niche, with little inter-GL competition. No pronounced patterns of regional or temporal separation of the GLs were detected, suggesting that the stability of the GLs primarily stems from limited outbreaks within small communities, so that only a small fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any time. These results raise the, perhaps pressing, question, How will increased host\u2013host contact resulting from globalization affect viral evolution? Could new or renewed competition emerge among lineages of endemic viruses to drive diversification, evolution of increased pathogenicity, or even virus speciation? With these questions in mind, we emphasize that, in addition to zoonotic events, the ongoing surveillance of familiar, endemic viruses deserves global attention in effort to mitigate or prevent future pandemics. \n\n\n## Brief Methods \n  \nGenomes were retrieved for all viruses except IAV H3N2 and SARS-CoV-2 from NCBI virus ( ). Members of related viral families were used to construct an outgroup when possible. IAV H3N2 (flu H3N2) segment HA was retrieved from the NCBI flu database ( ). The SARS-CoV-2 tree and alignment analyzed in this work was subsampled from a larger alignment consisting of all high-quality genomes that were available as of January 8, 2021 in the GISAID database ( ), as previously described ( ). Subsampling was conducted to maximize the sequence diversity. Acknowledgments for the GISAID deposited sequences used in this study are displayed in  . Subalignments were considered for H3N2 and EVA, principally for the purpose of effective population size analysis. In all cases, sequences were harmonized to DNA (e.g., U was transformed to T to amend software compatibility) and aligned with MAFFT ( ), using default settings. Sequences were clustered according to 100% identity with no coverage threshold using Cd-hit ( ), and, otherwise, default settings for MERS and H3N2. \n\nThe longest sequence from each cluster was selected as a representative. Exterior ambiguous characters were removed, and sequences with more than 10 remaining ambiguous characters (\u201cN\u201d) were discarded. Outliers based on hamming distance to the nearest neighbor and consensus were identified and removed from the set. Sites corresponding to protein-coding ORFs (open reading frames) were then mapped to the alignments, and noncoding regions were discarded. Common gaps corresponding to multiples of three nucleotides were maintained as \u201ctrue\u201d insertions or deletions and mapped into the frame if necessary. Unique alignment rows were identified. Samples related to laboratory experiments, vaccine-related sequences, and patents were pruned based on an automated keyword search \n\nDates and locations of isolation are available for many isolates reported as calendar dates and city or country/administrative region of origin. These dates are referenced as calendar dates in the main text and as date indices (number of days before/after January 1, 1950) in  . For the regional analysis, the latitude and longitude of each city of origin or a representative city for each country/administrative region of origin was identified from simplemaps ( ) ( ). Ambiguity in metadata assignments was not problematic ( ). \n\nWith the exception of SARS-CoV-2 and H3N2, tree topology was optimized using IQ-TREE ( ) with the evolutionary model fixed to GTR+F+G4 and the minimum branch length decreased from the default 10e-6 to 10e-7 (options: -m GTR+F+G4 -st DNA -blmin 0.0000001). For SARS-CoV-2, the tree was drawn from the global topology previously described ( ). The global H3N2 tree was approximated using FastTree ( ) specifying GTR; a four-category gamma distribution; no support values; and using a previously constructed maximum diversity subtree as a constraint (compiled at double precision, options: -nt -gtr -gamma -cat 4 -nosupport -constraints). Trees were rooted according to the position of an outgroup when possible, and by date or midpoint otherwise. \n\nViral lineages were both manually selected, based on available metadata, and algorithmically selected, into correlated clades we call GLs. GLs are defined as monophyletic clades with a strong correlation between the sequencing date and the distance to the tree root. Trees were used to construct date-constrained, genealogical trees using least-square dating (with software LSD2) ( ). We considered the Shannon entropy of the clade distribution calculated over sliding windows based on the known or estimated date of isolation or based on distance to the tree root as an explicit measure of lineage turnover. \n\nFitch Traceback ( ) was used to estimate ancestral states. Three classes of amino acid sites were identified on the basis of the nonsynonymous mutations within each site: 1) MD substitutions are \u201clineage defining\u201d; 2) MS sites. 3) AS sites. We computed the site density of each class over a sliding window to assess signatures of positive selection. Selection pressures were also assessed through   dN/dS   analysis using PAML ( ). \n\nThe effective population size   Ne   and the ratio of the census population size   N   over   Ne   was estimated as previously described ( ) ( ). Viral diversity (average time of any pair of leaves at a given time point to find their LCA) and average TMRCA over time were calculated with the PACT package as well. In order to demonstrate the potential equivalency between the impacts of selection strength and sampling density on effective population size, we additionally simulated an ensemble of trees. \n\nViral phylogenies were compared to trees simulated under a neutral model, shallowly sampled to reflect the fact that the MRCAs are predicted to have circulated much earlier than the invention of sequencing technologies. When necessary, maximally diverse subtrees of the respective viral phylogeny with the same number of leaves as in each simulated tree were generated. For all trees, real and simulated, the number of parallel branches from the root to the tree tips was computed. In order to probe the coalescence rate among, rather than within, extant lineages, the date associated with the deepest leaves was determined, and the period from the root to that point was further examined. The number of branches from the deepest leaves back toward the root was then fit to a single-parameter power-law expression [based on expectations of a power-law distribution of node descendants ( )] ( ). The derivative of each curve ( ) as well as the log-fold difference between the derivatives of the simulation and the real genealogical tree for each virus were computed ( ). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9191635, "text_md5": "5c024111b5a3bbd44b4ebc0f4b96e440", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 108], "journal": [109, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 242], "keywords": [256, 333], "abstract": [346, 2965], "body": [2974, 64809]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35639694, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2121335119", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9191635", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9191635"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9191635\">9191635</a>", "list_title": "PMC9191635  Human pathogenic RNA viruses establish noncompeting lineages by occupying independent niches"}

Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1) is involved in eumelanin synthesis, catalyzing the oxidation of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid oxidase (DHICA) to 5,6-indolequinone-2-carboxylic acid (IQCA). Here, for the first time, four OCA3-causing mutations of Tyrp1, C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H, were investigated computationally to understand Tyrp1 protein stability and catalytic activity. Using the Tyrp1 crystal structure (PDB:5M8L), global mutagenesis was conducted to evaluate mutant protein stability. Consistent with the foldability parameter, C30R and H215Y should exhibit greater instability, and two other mutants, D308N and R326H, are expected to keep a native conformation. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the purified recombinant proteins confirmed that the foldability parameter correctly predicted the effect of mutations critical for protein stability. Further, the mutant variant structures were built and simulated for 100 ns to generate free energy landscapes and perform docking experiments. Free energy landscapes formed by Y362, N378, and T391 indicate that the binding clefts of C30R and H215Y mutants are larger than the wild-type Tyrp1. In docking simulations, the hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions that stabilize DHICA in the active site remain similar among Tyrp1, D308N, and R326H. However, the strengths of these interactions and stability of the docked ligand may decrease proportionally to mutation severity due to the larger and less well-defined natures of the binding clefts in mutants. Mutational perturbations in mutants that are not unfolded may result in allosteric alterations to the active site, reducing the stability of protein-ligand interactions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nHuman tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1) is a transmembrane, metal-containing glycoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) to 5,6-quinone-2-carboxylic acid (IQCA). It is one of three tyrosinase-like enzymes in human melanocytes that are involved in the biosynthesis of melanin, a pigment found in hair, skin, and the iris of the eye. Mutations in the Tyrp1 gene (  TYRP1  ) can lead to oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3), an autosomal recessive disease. Those with OCA3 typically present with one of two phenotypes: rufous OCA (ROCA) or brown OCA (BOCA). ROCA is characterized by red-bronze skin color, blue or brown irises, and ginger-red hair, while BOCA is characterized by light to brown hair and light to brown or tan skin color. \n\nFour conserved regions exist among all three tyrosinase-like enzymes: an N-terminal signal peptide, an intra-melanosomal domain, one transmembrane \u03b1-helix, and a small C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Within the intra-melanosomal domain, there exist both a Cys-rich subdomain and a tyrosinase-like subdomain containing a binuclear metal-ion binding motif. The crystal structure of the intra-melanosomal fragment of Tyrp1, which includes both subdomains (residues 25\u2013470) was determined at 2.35 \u00c5 [ ]. In total, Tyrp1 contains 537 residues comprising the signal peptide (1\u201324), the intra-melanosomal domain (Cys-rich subdomain 25\u2013126, tyrosinase-like subdomain 127\u2013477), the transmembrane \u03b1-helix (478\u2013501), and the cytoplasmic domain (502\u2013537). \n\nThe core of the Cys-rich subdomain of Tyrp1 resembles the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain due to its patterned disulfide bridges and short antiparallel \u00df-strands [ , ]. It contains five total disulfide bridges, three of them located within the EGF-like fold. Most albinism-related mutations of Tyrp1 affect its stability or activity, and expansion of the interface between the EGF-like domain and the tyrosinase-like domain was linked to OCA Type 1B mutations in tyrosinase [ , ]. One such mutation, C30R, breaks the C30-C41 disulfide bridge and results in OCA3 [ ]. Tyrp1 was found to have a binuclear zinc active site rather than the typical binuclear copper active site found in tyrosinases ( ). A four-helix bundle within the tyrosinase-like subdomain contains six total histidine residues that coordinate the Zn metal ions, which are bridged by a single water molecule. ZnA is coordinated by H192, H215, and H224, while ZnB is coordinated by H377, H381, and H404. In tyrosinase, histidine is essential for catalytic activity, and in both tyrosinase and Tyrp1, mutations to metal-coordinating histidine residues can result in reduced activity and consequently different forms of albinism [ , ]. Mutations to H215, H224, and H381 were specifically identified to have OCA3 [ , ]. Tyrp1 is an N-linked glycoprotein that contains sugars at six N sites (96, 104, 181, 304, 350, 385). Glycosylation has been shown to help ensure proper folding and stabilize tyrosinase-like structures during the process of translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytoplasm of the melanocyte [ , , ]. \n\nThe unfolding mutation screen (UMS) was developed to understand and evaluate the effect of missense mutations on protein folding and thermodynamic stability [ , ]. This program uses protein unfolding curves and thermodynamic changes in Gibbs free energy (\u0394\u0394G), determined by FoldX to calculate propensities of mutations in global mutagenesis [ ]. Initially, UMS [ ] was tested with 16 crystal structures to evaluate the unfolding of 1391 mutations from the ProTherm database. UMS showed that the computational accuracy of the unfolding calculations was similar to the accuracy of previously published free energy changes, but provided a better scale. The results are then projected onto a protein model to highlight the critical residues and regions of structural importance to the protein [ ].  \n\nWhile mutations leading to OCA3 have been discovered, the molecular mechanisms leading to these results have yet to be elucidated. Here, for the first time, we used computational methods to identify mechanisms behind mutation instability and differences behind protein-ligand interactions in Tyrp1 and OCA3-causing mutations. Understanding the differences in protein-ligand interactions among Tyrp1 and its associated mutations can establish mechanisms by which they change Tyrp1 catalytic activity. Coupled with   in vitro   and   in vivo   studies, in silico studies of similar nature can help lead to novel therapies for OCA3 patients. \n\n\n## 2. Results \n  \n### 2.1. Crystal Structure of Tyrp1 and OCA3-Related Mutants \n  \nTyrp1 is a metalloenzyme involved in melanin synthesis. Mutations to the   TYRP1   gene can result in OCA3. The location of four OCA3 mutations was analyzed using the crystal structure of Tyrp1 ( ). C30 is located within the Cys-rich subdomain of human Tyrp1 and forms the first of five disulfide bridges with C41. A mutation from cysteine to arginine (C30R) breaks the disulfide bridge. Between C30 and C41 in Tyrp1 exists a loop with a small \u03b1-helix. The Cys-rich subdomain is a very stable region of Tyrp1 so removing a disulfide bridge could result in a loss of stability and greater flexibility within the region. H215 is one of the six zinc-coordinating histidine residues, coordinating ZnA. Mutating histidine to tyrosine (H215Y) removes a coordination bond for ZnA, leaving it with only two coordination sites. This mutation could change how the active site is folded while the protein is synthesized in the ER, affecting its ability to catalyze the reaction from DHICA to IQCA. D308 is located on the periphery of Tyrp1. The mutation from aspartic acid to asparagine (D308N) could introduce the formation of two transient hydrogen bonds with the nearby D291 ( ). R326H is also located on the periphery of Tyrp1. The mutation from arginine to histidine (R326H) removes the two transient hydrogen bonds between R326 and E329, resulting in a loss of stability ( ).  \n\nOCA3-related mutant variants were analyzed computationally to understand their protein stability. Protein residue-residue distance maps were created in search of structural changes, which were caused by molecular dynamic simulations. In addition, we looked for the most stable conformations of the mutant binding sites and docking Tyrp1 ligands to understand a possible mechanism of Tyrp1 catalytic activity. \n\n\n### 2.2. Mutant Variant Stability \n  \nTo determine the severity of the thermodynamic changes in each OCA3 mutation in comparison to Tyrp1, the Tyrp1 structure was run through the Unfolding Mutation Screen (UMS) [ , ]. UMS ascribed each mutation a \u2206\u2206G value and unfolding parameter to describe the thermodynamic change in free energy and the fraction of unfolded protein, respectively ( ).  \n\nEach Tyrp1 residue also received a foldability parameter or an aggregated sum of the propensities of the unfolding parameters of that residue\u2019s mutation. The foldability parameter is meant to highlight the most critical residues involved in the structural and thermodynamic stability of the protein [ , ]. C30 and H215 are expected to contribute the most to protein stability with foldability values of 18.99 and 19.85, respectively. These values are consistent with the unfolding parameters of the C30R and H215Y mutations, which are both 1.00, indicating a complete unfolding or misfolding of the mutant. D308 and R326 are deemed to be less integral to Tyrp1 stability per UMS with foldability parameters of 0.98 and 6.74, respectively. The D308N and R326H mutants reflect the foldability parameters with unfolding parameters of 0.56 and 0.98. The mutants are expected to be stable molecules with the native protein fold preserved. The predicted effect of the mutation was matching the available ClinVar data (ClinVar (nih.gov)) for H215Y and R326H. The effect of mutation C30R was expected to be pathogenic [ ].  \n\nThe results of in silico analysis of protein stability were verified experimentally and will be presented in the accompanying experimental manuscript (Dolinska et al., in preparation). Briefly, to investigates the effect of genetic mutations on the human Tyrp1 structure, function, and stability, we expressed and purified the intra-melanosomal domain of Tyrp1 located in residues 25\u2013537 of the native protein and its OCA3-related mutants, C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H. The proteins were produced in the whole insect   Trichoplusia ni   larvae, purified by immobilized metal affinity (IMAC) and gel filtration (GF) chromatography, and analyzed using the SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot. Tyrp1, D308N, and R326H migrated through the SDS-PAGE gel as broad, heterogeneous bands between 55 and 70 kDa ( , upper panel). These bands reacted strongly with the anti-Tyrp1 antibody (TA99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) ( , low panel). The heterogeneity of the protein\u2019s molecular weight can be attributed to the N-linked glycosylation of the enzymes. In contrast, C30R and H215Y mutants indicate no (or very weak) bands at the proper position on SDS-PAGE gel and the Western blot. Both mutants are not properly folded and are therefore unstable and aggregate during the purification process. Our experimental data confirmed that the foldability analysis could correctly evaluate the effect of mutations critical for protein stability. \n\nFinally, we demonstrated by using both UMS and experimental SDS-PAGE that the C30R and H215Y mutants are not stable due to severe damage from genetic perturbation. We expect that two other mutant proteins, D308N and R326H, are stable and will show some catalytic activity. \n\n\n### 2.3. Cys-rich Subdomain Instability \n  \nMutant variants were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) as described in   and were further investigated using residue-residue distance maps, which were generated for all five structures in UCSF Chimera [ ] ( ). Each structure\u2019s map compared distances across five timestamps at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ns to provide a comprehensive characterization of the MD simulation. \n\nThe most interesting case was the C30R mutant, which broke the C30-C41 disulfide bridge. UMS expects C30 mutants to have severe effects on Tyrp1 structural and thermodynamic stability, and the C30R mutant specifically is expected to have a complete loss of protein stability ( ). The expression and purification of C30R are consistent with the values generated by UMS. Consequently, the mutant contained notable fluctuations in the R30-C41 region. To highlight the effect of these fluctuations, a small portion of the map is shown in  . C30-C41 is one of five disulfide bridges within the Cys-rich subdomain, and in between the two cysteine residues is a short \u03b1-helix (V33-S38) ( A). The C30-C41 region (R30-C41 in the C30R mutant) was mapped against the E168-T176 region, a neighboring loop ( B). C30R demonstrated a much higher level of flexibility within this region with a standard deviation of distances up to 4.87 \u00c5, compared to 1.19 \u00c5 in Tyrp1. No other mutant had a standard deviation above 1.27\u00c5 in the region ( ). The C30-C41 region is located within the Cys-rich subdomain, indicating an introduction of flexibility due to the loss of the C30-C41 disulfide bridge in the C30R mutant.  \n\n\n### 2.4. Free Energy Landscapes \n  \nFree energy landscapes are usually obtained to investigate the relative stabilities of different conformational states in a biomolecule concerning a conformation coordinate of interest [ ]. In our work, free energy landscapes were created for Tyrp1 and two mutant variants, D308N and R326H, which are expected to form stable protein structures. A macro was created in YASARA to measure the distance between T391 and both Y362 and N378 for every simulation snapshot ( ). T391, Y362, and N378 are the residues expected to form the bottleneck for the passage of the DHICA molecule (Radius = 3.45 \u00c5). Tyrp1 had a mean of 7.37 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 1.05 \u00c5 for the Y362-T391 distance and a mean of 8.47 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 1.28 \u00c5 for the N378-T391 distance. D308N had a mean of 8.45 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 0.65 \u00c5 for the Y362-T391 distance and a mean of 10.62 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 1.65 \u00c5 for the N378-T391 distance. R326H had a mean of 9.90 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 1.50 \u00c5 for the Y362-T391 distance and a mean of 9.93 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 1.65 \u00c5 for the N378-T391 distance. Distances were inputted into the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) to generate free energy landscapes for all three structures [ , , ]. The free energy of each bin of data was related to probability using the Boltzmann distribution to identify the most probable conformations of the bottleneck residues. Tyrp1 and D308N appeared to be well-defined peaks centered around the (7.10, 8.05) \u00c5 with a probability of 0.067 and (8.52, 10.90) \u00c5 with a probability of 0.068, respectively ( A,B). The D308N landscape indicates that the most probable distances between the bottleneck suggest a larger opening to the active site ( B). R326H is a much less well-defined contour, with no central peak ( C). The most probable data bin is centered around (8.52, 8.52) with a probability of 0.032. Overall, Tyrp1 has a more compact bottleneck than the bottlenecks of both D308N and R326H, potentially allowing for tighter binding and stronger interactions with DHICA. As a result, both mutant variants are expected to have reduced catalytic activity. \n\n\n### 2.5. Ligand\u2013Receptor Interactions \n  \nThe prediction of the reduced catalytic activity of mutant variants was further confirmed from the analysis of ligand-receptor interactions. DHICA was docked to the most probable bottleneck conformations of Tyrp1, D308N, and R326H per WHAM. \n\nThe effect of mutations D308N and R326H is shown in  A,B, respectively. Ligand\u2013receptor interactions are detailed in  A\u2013C. Docking results were considered only if the hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring of DHICA were oriented towards the active site and were within two water molecules of zinc. Interaction-related distances are listed in  . The results indicate that the partial positive of the NH  functional group of DHICA orients itself between the partial negative COO  side chains of D212 and E216. Both Tyrp1 and D308N have six total interactions with DHICA: four hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges. In Tyrp1, E216 accepts two hydrogen bonds and forms one salt bridge, D212 forms one salt bridge, and both T391 and the zinc-bridging water molecule donate one hydrogen bond to DHICA. One such hydrogen bond is donated from the zinc-bridging water molecule, indicating that the water may serve multiple functions within the active site. The distance from DHICA to a Tyrp1 zinc atom is 4.15 \u00c5. The salt bridge lengths are 2.79 \u00c5 and 3.91 \u00c5 for D212 and E216, respectively. In D308N, D212 accepts two hydrogen bonds and forms one salt bridge, D212 accepts one hydrogen bond and forms one salt bridge, and T391 donates one hydrogen bond. The distance from DHICA to a D308N zinc atom is 4.51 \u00c5. The salt bridge lengths are 4.31 \u00c5 and 4.49 \u00c5 for D212 and E216, respectively. R326H has four total interactions with DHICA: three hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge. The distance from DHICA to an R326H zinc atom is 3.63\u00c5. E212 accepts one hydrogen bond and forms one salt bridge, D216 accepts one hydrogen bond, and the zinc-bridging water molecule donates one hydrogen bond. Structural images indicate that a more open bottleneck affects the ligand-receptor interactions in the D308N and R326H mutants ( ). Gaps begin to appear between the surfaces of the ligand and the active site in D308N and are exacerbated in R326H, demonstrating a weaker active site-bound ligand. R326H-DHICA interactions appear to only have one salt bridge due to the larger opening in the active site. As the oxidation of DHICA occurs, the two salt bridges seem to be integral to ligand stabilization within the active site. In comparison with Tyrp1, the weakened and fewer interactions with DHICA in D308N and R326H may result in a less stable protein-ligand complex, affecting the oxidation from DHICA to IQCA. The weakening of protein-ligand binding might indicate the reduced catalytic activity of both mutant variants. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \nTyrp1 is one of three key enzymes involved in the melanogenesis pathway, which results in the production of melanin pigment. It is a glycoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of DHICA to IQCA. Mutations to the   TYRP1   gene can result in the autosomal recessive disorder OCA3. Four OCA3 mutants of interest were chosen from Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional | QIAGEN to better understand Tyrp1 protein stability and catalytic activity: C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H. Global mutagenesis and Western Blot suggested that C30R and H215Y were severely unstable, while D308N and R326H conserved some level of catalytic activity. Free energy landscapes of the Tyrp1 bottleneck demonstrated that a slight loss of catalytic activity in D308N and R326H may be due to a larger active site, affecting interactions that stabilize DHICA during catalysis. These non-covalent interactions include salt bridges from D212 and E216 as well as various hydrogen bonds. Structural perturbations resulting from the D308N and R326H mutants may result in allosteric alterations to the active site that affect the stability of the ligand during the redox reaction. \n\nUMS predicted mutants C30R and H215Y would be completely misfolded or unfolded, and mutants D308N and R326H to retain some stability. The results of global mutagenesis were confirmed by experimental SDS-PAGE and Western Blot, providing further validity to UMS and its ability to predict mutant stability using the foldability parameter. \n\nC30R is in the Cys-rich subdomain, and it breaks the C30-C41 disulfide bridge. The Cys-rich subdomain of Tyrp1 is an extremely stable portion of the protein and a loss of a disulfide bridge may introduce thermodynamic instability and structural flexibility to this region. While the simulation did not suggest mutant unfolding, the mutation could alter the folding process while C30R is synthesized in the ER, resulting in a completely misfolded or unfolded protein. \n\nH215Y is located within the active site, and it removes one of three coordination sites for ZnA. UMS also expects mutations of H215 to have a severe effect on the structural and thermodynamic stability of Tyrp1, and the \u2206\u2206G value of H215Y indicates the greatest effect out of all four mutants of interest. The expression and purification of H215Y are consistent with the results generated by UMS. The loss of a coordination bond is expected to affect active site stability, particularly the zinc atom\u2019s ability to remain situated within the binding pocket, resulting in a lack of catalytic activity. A comparison of H215Y structures at various points in the simulation did not suggest any active site structural alterations. All four transmembrane helices and the zinc-water-zinc complex remained in place. Residue-residue distance maps did not suggest structural fluctuations not seen in Tyrp1. However, since the mutant is expected to be unfolded or misfolded, the lack of trends towards structural alterations indicates that the protein may be unable to properly complete the folding process as it is synthesized in the ER. Similar results were seen in copper-coordinating histidine OCA1A mutations in human tyrosinase (Tyr) [ ]. It was suggested that the folding of Tyr occurs in four distinct stages. Folding of the Cys-rich region and folding of each half of the transmembrane helix bundle comprise the first three stages, with the latter two stages forming the active site. Similar to Tyr, the Tyrp1 helix bundle is comprised of two helix-loop-helix motifs. Each motif contains three zinc-coordinating histidine residues and is small enough to form within a ribosome exit tunnel. Once the entire protein is processed by the ribosome, both helix-loop-helix motifs come together with the zinc-water-zinc complex to form the active site. However, without all six zinc-coordinating histidine residues, the zinc atoms are unable to correctly position themselves within the active site, and the transmembrane helix bundle does not form, leading to a full loss of catalytic activity in Tyrp1 due to denaturation. \n\nD308N is located on the periphery of the protein, and it introduces the formation of two transient hydrogen bonds. D308 is not expected to be critical to Tyrp1 stability, and UMS does not expect D308N to be unfolded or misfolded, having the lowest \u2206\u2206G of any of the four mutants. The expression and purification of D308N are consistent with UMS results. The addition of hydrogen bonds suggests that the stability of the mutant region might be increased. Effects of the mutation may result in allosteric alterations to active site structure as described by the most probable conformations of the bottleneck residues. The size of the bottleneck increases compared to Tyrp1, and computational docking experiments indicate that this difference may affect ligand-receptor interactions. While the number and type of noncovalent interactions between DHICA and D308N remain similar to those of Tyrp1, the strength of the stabilizing salt bridges decreases due to distance. The increased distances of these interactions are reflected in the surface images, where DHICA is not as tightly bound to the active site, leading to a loss of catalytic activity in D308N. \n\nR326H is also located on the periphery of the protein, and it has two transient hydrogen bonds with E329. Mutations to R326 are expected to have varying levels of influence on Tyrp1 stability, and UMS does not expect R326H to be completely unfolded or misfolded. The expression and purification of R326H are consistent with UMS results. The removal of two hydrogen bonds suggests some loss of stability, and like D308N, this change in protein stability may result in allosteric alterations to the bottleneck structure. Again, the bottleneck increases compared to Tyrp1\u2032s bottlenecks, but unlike D308N, the free energy landscapes do not indicate any centralized peak, and the altered bottleneck affects ligand-receptor interactions. The total number of noncovalent interactions decreases, subsequently decreasing the stability of the ligand in the active site. Fewer interactions are reflected in the surface images, where large gaps appear between DHICA and R326H. These gaps indicate the DHICA is not as tightly bound to the protein, leading to a loss of catalytic activity in R326H. \n\nWhile both the D308N and R326H mutations do not directly affect the stability of the active site, their allosteric impacts may result in free energy changes. Enzymes have been shown to have residues that are part of allosteric regulatory sites critical to long-range communication [ ]. A conservative replacement of D308 and R326 could result in free energy alterations that affect protein-ligand interactions. Both mutations are within 15 \u00c5 of transmembrane helices containing zinc-coordinating histidine residues, and mutational perturbations could affect the packing and dynamics of these helices that comprise the active site. Previous studies have shown that this long-range modulation of protein features can alter protein stability, thereby contributing to allosteric modulation of function [ ]. Both D308 and R326 may be part of an intra-protein interaction network that allosterically affects the structure of the active site, particularly the bottleneck residues. This allosteric effect could be interpreted at the level of interatomic interactions. The addition and removal of hydrogen bonds in D308N and R326H, respectively, could perturb the transmembrane helices, increasing the size of the bottleneck and weakening the interactions between DHICA and the protein. These weakened interactions, in turn, affect the stabilization of DHICA within the active site and could result in reduced catalytic activity. In both the Tyrp1 and R326H docking experiments, DHICA was shown to accept a hydrogen bond from the active site water molecule. While previous studies indicated that the water molecule\u2019s purpose was to bridge the zinc atoms, it may serve multiple functions within the active site, including stabilization of the DHICA ligand. \n\nAlthough UMS foldability has shown to be an accurate predictor of protein expression and stability, it remains to be seen if this translates to phenotypic variations in OCA3. Since D308N and R326H are expected to have some level of protein activity, patients with these mutations should have reduced the severity of OCA3. If UMS can accurately predict the extent of these mutations, it could be a useful resource in helping guide personal patient therapies to those affected by OCA3. \n\n\n## 4. Methods \n  \n### 4.1. Molecular Modeling and Simulation \n  \nFour OCA3 mutations (C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H) were selected from HGMD [ , , ]. They were generated using the Edit > Swap > Residue function on the 5M8L PDB file in YASARA ( , accessed on 15 July 2021). All four mutants and the original 5M8L structure were subjected to 100 ns of MD using YASARA\u2019s \u2018run.mcr\u2019 macro. Ion concentration was added as a mass fraction with 0.9% NaCl. The simulation temperature was set to 298 K with a water density of 0.997 g/mL. Tyrosinases are synthesized in the ER and function in melanosomes at pH 5.5. To replicate the melanosome environment, the simulation pH was set to 5.5. The cell size extended to 10 \u00c5 beyond each side of the protein in the shape of a cube with dimensions 92.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 92.9 \u00c5 \u00d7 92.9 \u00c5. Each simulation was run in YASARA using an AMBER14 forcefield, with a timestep of 2.5 fs. Simulation snapshots were outputted for every 0.1 ns, resulting in 1000 simfiles for each simulation. \n\n\n### 4.2. Unfolding Mutation Screen \n  \nGlobal mutagenesis was conducted on Tyrp1, and each mutant was characterized by a thermodynamic change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394\u0394G) [ , ]. These values were calculated using the semi-empirical method (FoldX) and standardized on a 0\u20131 scale as the unfolding parameter, or the fraction of protein in the unfolded state [ , ]. UMS also outputted a foldability parameter to show critical residues in protein folding. This parameter is a sum of severity-weighted unfolding propensities for the 19 mutations generated at a specific residue. Residues with the highest foldability were considered critical for protein folding [ ]. The full-atomic TYRP1 homology model and the results of the unfolding mutation screen are freely available from the ocular proteome website at the NEI Commons ( , accessed on 19 July 2021). \n\n\n### 4.3. Free Energy Landscape \n  \nFree energy landscapes were created for the Tyrp1, D308N, and R326H to determine the highest probability conformation of the binding site. The active site bottleneck residues were determined to be Y362, N378, and T391 ( ). A weighted histogram analysis method was used to determine the free energy [ , , ]. The 2D version was used so that two reaction coordinates comprising the three residues would be considered in the free energy landscape. Two distances Y362(OH)-T391(OG1) and N378(OD1)-T391(OG1) were chosen as non-periodic reaction coordinates. A macro was created and run in YASARA to calculate the distances at every simulation snapshot, resulting in a dataset of 1000 points. The data points were sorted into 21 bins with a minimum bin of 4 and a maximum bin of 14. WHAM parameters included 10  for the tolerance, 298 K for the temperature, 0 for the number of padding values (due to the aperiodic reaction coordinate), and 0 for the spring constant. \n\n\n### 4.4. Docking Experiments \n  \nPDB files were created for Tyrp1, D308N, and R326H at timestamps where the Y362-T391 and N378-T391 distances corresponded to the highest probability bin per WHAM. The protein structure was imported, processed, and refined at pH 5.5 using the Protein Preparation Wizard tool in Maestro [ ]. A preprocessing job was submitted with assigned bond orders, use of CCD database, add hydrogens, create zero bond orders, create disulfide bonds, and delete waters beyond 5.00 \u00c5 from heteroatom groups turned on in pH 5.5. Hydrogen bonds were optimized with water sampling on, and crystal symmetry and minimize hydrogens of altered species off in pH 5.5. Restrained minimization was conducted using an RMSD of 0.3 in forcefield OPLS3e. A 2D structure of DHICA was created in Open Babel [ ]. Then, 32 DHICA states were generated using the LigPrep function. The states were generated in Epik in pH 5.5 using an OPLS3e forcefield and retaining specified chiralities, with desalting and generating tautomers on [ , ]. A receptor grid was created using the Receptor Grid Generation function. The receptor box was centered around the two zinc atoms and the water molecule, and the box was set to 10 \u00c5 within the centroid. The Van der Waals (VDW) radius scaling factor was set to 1.0, and the partial charge cutoff was 0.25. No constraints were added. All 32 DHICA states were docked to the generated receptor grid using the Ligand Docking function. The VDW scaling factor was 0.8 with a partial charge cutoff of 0.15. Standard precision and flexible ligand sampling were used with sample nitrogen inversions, sample ring conformations, bias sampling of torsions for all predefined functional groups, and add Epik state penalties to docking score turned on. No constraints were added. Docking results were only considered if the hydroxyl groups of DHICA docked within two water molecules of the binuclear zinc active site (~5.5 \u00c5). \n\n\n### 4.5. Structure Comparison \n  \nTyrp1 and OCA3 mutant structures were compared in UCSF Chimera [ ]. Residue-residue distance maps were created to highlight where the movement occurred over time. PDB files were created at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ns of the simulation for all five structures. The structures were aligned using the MatchMaker tool, with the structure as 0 ns used as a reference. The \u2018best aligning pair of chains between reference and match structures\u2019 option was selected for chain pairing, Needleman\u2013Wunsch was selected as the alignment algorithm, BLOSUM-62 was selected as the matrix, with a gap extension of 1 and include secondary structure score of 30% and compute secondary structure assignment turned on. Matching was conducted by iterating by pruning along atom pairs until no pair exceeds 2.0 \u00c5. Residue-residue distance maps were created for all five structures using the RR Distance Maps function by importing the five timestamped files for each structure. Both the average distance and standard deviation were calculated for each map. \n\n\n### 4.6. In Vitro Analysis of Tyrp1 and OCA3-Related Mutants \n  \nRecombinant human wild-type intra-melanosomal domain of the tyrosinase-related protein (residues 25\u2013537 of the native protein), Tyrp1, and OCA3-related mutants, C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H, were expressed in baculovirus and produced in whole insect   T. ni   larvae. Proteins were purified using methods previously described [ , ], and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4\u201315% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) stained with Thermo Scientific GelCode Blue reagent (Thermo Scientific, Schaumburg, IL, USA). Protein identity was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Tyrp1 antibody (TA99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA, 1:500 dilution). \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nFor the first time, the mutant variants of Tyrp1, C30R, H215Y, D308N, and R326H were analyzed computationally. We have demonstrated that the protein stability changes caused by the disease-causing mutation could be predicted using the unfolding mutation screen. For three mutant variants, the predicted changes are associated with OCA3 clinical data on genetic disease severity. We demonstrated that both the C30R and H215Y mutants result in a complete loss of protein stability as they affect structurally integral regions of Tyrp1, which is consistent with   in vitro   experiments. Both D308N and R326H conserve the structure of these regions but may allosterically affect the conformation of the active site, increasing the size of the bottleneck. This effect is highlighted in protein-ligand interactions. While the noncovalent interactions largely remain similar between Tyrp1 and D308N, their strength decreases due to distance. R326H, however, is shown to have an even greater effect on the bottleneck, resulting in both fewer and weaker interactions with DHICA. Identifying the bottleneck residues of active sites can help identify their most stable conformations and elucidate protein-ligand interactions integral to catalytic activity. These studies, coupled with   in vitro   and   in vivo   experiments, can advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind mutations of Tyrp1 and lead to novel therapies for patients with OCA3. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8508144, "text_md5": "dd2bb5c03831a88646459903710c92da", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 60], "journal": [61, 74], "publication_year": [76, 80], "title": [91, 205], "keywords": [219, 295], "abstract": [308, 2136], "body": [2145, 35098]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34638544, "doi": "10.3390/ijms221910203", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508144", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8508144"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508144\">8508144</a>", "list_title": "PMC8508144  Tyrp1 Mutant Variants Associated with OCA3: Computational Characterization of Protein Stability and Ligand Binding"}

Genomic medicine will only reach its full potential when genomic studies become more broadly representative of global populations. We are working to support the establishment of genomic medicine in developing countries in Latin America   via   studies of ethnically and ancestrally diverse Colombian populations. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of ethnicity and genetic ancestry on observed disease prevalence and predicted disease risk in Colombia. Population distributions of Colombia\u2019s three major ethnic groups \u2013 Mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous \u2013 were compared to disease prevalence and socioeconomic indicators. Indigenous and Mestizo ethnicity show the highest correlations with disease prevalence, whereas the effect of Afro-Colombian ethnicity is substantially lower. Mestizo ethnicity is mostly negatively correlated with six high-impact health conditions and positively correlated with seven of eight common cancers; Indigenous ethnicity shows the opposite effect. Malaria prevalence in particular is strongly correlated with ethnicity. Disease prevalence co-varies across geographic regions, consistent with the regional distribution of ethnic groups. Ethnicity is also correlated with regional variation in human development, partially explaining the observed differences in disease prevalence. Patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture for a cohort of 624 individuals from Medell\u00edn were compared to disease risk inferred   via   polygenic risk scores (PRS). African genetic ancestry is most strongly correlated with predicted disease risk, whereas European and Native American ancestry show weaker effects. African ancestry is mostly positively correlated with disease risk, and European ancestry is mostly negatively correlated. The relationships between ethnicity and disease prevalence do not show an overall correspondence with the relationships between ancestry and disease risk. We discuss possible reasons for the divergent health effects of ethnicity and ancestry as well as the implication of our results for the development of precision medicine in Colombia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGenomic medicine is an emerging medical discipline that entails the use of genomic information about an individual as part of their clinical care \u2013 in support of better diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-making ( ;  ). Genomic medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, but the vast majority of genomics research cohorts are currently made up of individuals with European ancestry ( ;  ). Clinical insights based on the study of European ancestry genomes will not necessarily replicate across diverse populations ( ). This genomics research gap limits the reach of genomic medicine and threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities ( ;  ). The promise of genomic medicine will not be fully realized until genomic studies become more broadly representative of global populations. \n\nColombia has a diverse, multi-ethnic population with major ancestry contributions from Europe, Africa, and the Americas ( ;  ;  ). Colombian genomic diversity represents a rich and largely untapped resource that can be used to support the development of genomic medicine locally in Colombia and around the world. We have been working to build local capacity in precision medicine   via   population and clinical genomic studies of diverse Colombian populations over the last decade ( , ;  ;  ;  ,  , ;  ;  ,  ;  ). These studies share the broad aims of (1) characterizing patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture within and between Colombian and other Latin American populations, and (2) exploring the relationship between ancestry and genetic determinants of health and disease in the region. \n\nThe goal of the current study was to analyze the effect of ethnicity and genetic ancestry on observed disease prevalence and predicted disease risk in Colombia. We focused on Colombia\u2019s three largest ethnic groups \u2013 Mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous \u2013 along with corresponding genetic ancestry contributions from Europe, Africa, and the Americas. We studied health conditions and diseases that have been prioritized by the Colombian government as having an outsized impact on public health and the economy \u2013 six high impact non-cancer conditions along with eight of the most common cancers. Ethnicity and disease prevalence were analyzed at the level of administrative departments (states) and geographic regions, and genetic ancestry and disease risk were inferred using whole genome genotype (WGG) data for a diverse cohort of 624 individuals. We found that disease prevalence and risk are associated with ethnicity, geography, socioeconomics, and genetic ancestry in Colombia, and we discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the development of precision medicine in the country. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study Cohorts \n  \nA cohort of 624 individuals from Medell\u00edn, Colombia was recruited and genotyped by GenomaCES Biotechnologies of the Universidad CES (UniCES),  and a cohort of 99 individuals from Choc\u00f3, Colombia was recruited and genotyped as part of the ChocoGen research project.  All sample donors signed informed consent, and all participant recruiting, sampling, and genetic characterization was done following the Helsinki ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. Human subject research in Colombia was conducted in accordance with article 11, resolution 8,430, 1993 of the Colombian Ministry of Health, which states that for every investigation in which a human being is the study subject, respect for their dignity and the protection for their rights should always be observed. The UniCES Medell\u00edn cohort was recruited and characterized with the approval of the Ethics and Research Committee of the Universidad CES. The ChocoGen project was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica del Choc\u00f3. Population genomic analysis was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Georgia Institute of Technology. \n\n\n### Ethnicity, Disease Prevalence, and Socioeconomic Data \n  \nData on Colombian ethnic groups was taken from the 2005 census as reported by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE;  ). Ethnic identity is self-reported in the Colombian census, and individuals choose from one of six ethnic groups: (1)   Ind\u00edgena  , (2)   Rom  , (3)   Raizal del Archipi\u00e9lago de San Andr\u00e9s y Providencia  , (4)   Palanquero de San Basilio  , (5)   Negro(a)  ,   mulato(a)  ,   afrocolombiano(a) o afrodescendiente  , and (6)   Ninguna de las anteriores   ( ). We focused on the three largest ethnic groups in Colombia: Mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous. The ethnic group labels, we use for this study are English translations of the officially used Spanish group names in Colombia, except for the Spanish word Mestizo, which we adopt here as it is widely used in both English and Spanish. Following the convention of DANE, Indigenous ethnic identity corresponds to question #1   Ind\u00edgena  , Afro-Colombian ethnic identity corresponds to questions #3, #4, and #5, all of which correspond to specific Afro-Colombian communities or identities, and Mestizo ethnic identity corresponds to question #6   Ninguna de las anteriores   (none of the above). The Mestizo group, which may include individuals who identify as white or Mestizo, is also referred to as   sin pertenencia \u00e9tnia   (no ethnicity), reflecting the fact that majority population individuals are not considered to belong to any of Colombia\u2019s officially recognized minority ethnic groups. The   Rom   census question refers the Roma community, which makes up less than 0.01% of the Colombian population and was therefore not considered here. Population numbers and percentages for each of the three major ethnic groups are reported for the entire country and for each of 32 administrative departments plus the capital district of Bogot\u00e1. Regional population numbers and percentages for the three groups were calculated based on the administrative departments that make up each of the five geographic regions ( ). \n\nThe Colombian   Instituto Nacional de Salud   and the non-governmental organization   Cuenta de Alto Costo   were used to identify health conditions and diseases that have a maximum impact on public health and the economy. We chose six non-cancer conditions and eight of the most common cancers for analysis. Prevalence data for these conditions and diseases were taken from two databases: (1)   Cuenta de Alto Costo  ,  and (2)   Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia en Salud P\u00fablica \u2013 SIVIGILA  .  Disease prevalence values are calculated and expressed as age- and sex-adjusted prevalence per 100,000 population. Disease prevalence data are reported for the entire country and for each of 32 administrative departments plus the capital district of Bogot\u00e1. \n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index combining three dimensions of human development: long and healthy life, knowledge, and standard of living.  Each dimension is measured by specific indicators: life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling, and gross national income   per capita  . Indicators are normalized, using fixed maximum and minimum values for each indicator, to yield I , I , and I  dimension index values that range from 0 to 1: dimension index (I)=(actual indicator value \u2013 minimum indicator value)/(maximum indicator value \u2013 minimum indicator value). The arithmetic mean of the two normalized education dimension index values is calculated for I . The HDI is calculated as the geometric mean of the three dimension index values: HDI=(I \u00d7I \u00d7I ) . HDI data for Colombian administrative departments was taken from the Global Data Lab,  and values range from 0.69 to 0.90. \n\nCorrelations between ethnic group percentages, HDI, and disease prevalence values for administrative departments were done using Pearson\u2019s correlation (  R  ) using the cor.test function in base R v3.5.1 ( ). Ethnic group percentages are the percentage of the population that each ethnic group makes up for each administrative department, values range from 0 to 98.27%. Disease prevalence values are taken for each administrative department, as described above, values range from 0 to 7,847 cases per 100,000 population. \n\n\n### Genetic Ancestry and Disease Risk Prediction \n  \nUniversidad CES Medell\u00edn cohort participants\u2019 WGG were characterized using the Illumina Global Screening Array,  and ChocoGen cohort participants\u2019 WGG were characterized using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 Array.  Full details on the sampling, DNA extraction, genotyping, and quality control procedures for these data, all of which were characterized for previous studies, have been reported elsewhere ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe UniCES Medell\u00edn cohort WGG data were merged and harmonized with whole genome sequence (WGS) data from global reference populations representing three continental population group ancestries \u2013 European, African, and Native American ( ) \u2013 characterized as part of the 1,000 Genomes Project (1KGP), using the program PLINK v1.9 and bespoke scripts ( ;  ). Variant data from UniCES WGG and 1KGP WGS were merged to include variants that were present in both datasets with a missingness and minor allele frequency filters of 5 and 1%, respectively. Variant strand flips and identifier inconsistencies were corrected as needed. The merged and harmonized dataset contained 425,732 genome-wide variants. This combined dataset was then merged with WGG from Choc\u00f3, Colombia characterized as part of the ChocoGen project (see footnote 2), with a missingness threshold of 5%. The three-way merged UniCES-1KGP-ChocoGen dataset contained 77,575 variants. The three-way merged dataset was pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD) using the \u201c--indep\u201d command in PLINK 1.9 with a window size of 50kb, a step size of five variants, and a variant inflation factor (VIF) threshold of two to yield a final merged, harmonized, and LD pruned dataset of 63,852 variants, which was used for genetic ancestry characterization. \n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) of the final variant dataset was performed using PLINK using the \u201c--pca\u201d option and the first two PCs for all samples were plotted using the ggplot2 package in R v3.5.1 ( ;  ). The program ADMIXTURE v1.30 was used to characterize participants\u2019 genome-wide ancestry fractions for the three continental ancestry groups \u2013 European, African, and Native American ( ). ADMIXTURE was run in unsupervised mode with default settings and   K  =3. \n\nThe NHGRI-EBI genome-wide association study (GWAS) Catalog was mined for trait-variant associations that correspond to the health conditions and diseases studied here.  Trait-associated variant sets corresponding to four of six non-cancer health conditions and seven of the eight common cancers were used to infer genetic disease risk   via   polygenic risk scores (PRS;  ). GWAS were filtered by trait of interest, type of study, number of individuals and distinct ancestries in the discovery and replication cohorts, and finally by number of associations reported. We aimed to identify at least one large, multi-ethnic study for each trait, under the assumption that PRS derived from multi-ethnic cohorts are less likely to be biased. Only traits with at least 20 variant associations were retained for PRS calculation. Variant identifiers (rsid), effect alleles, effect sizes, and   p  -values were collected from for each selected trait-study combination. Curated variant lists for each trait were subjected to LD clumping (\u201c--clump-r2 0.2\u201d) and used to calculate PRS for imputed genomic variant data for the UniCES Medell\u00edn cohort using PLINK (v1.90b6.16), as previously reported ( ,  ). PRS for each condition or disease   i   were calculated as the sum of the effect alleles across all trait-associated SNPs as \u2013   \u2013 where   corresponds to homozygous absent, heterozygous present, or homozygous present effect alleles at each variant, and   corresponds to the total number of alleles with base calls at each variant. WGG data were imputed using the 1KGP haplotype reference panel with the program IMPUTE2 version 2.3.2 ( ,  ). Imputed sites were retained for subsequent analysis if they had a 95% imputation rate across samples and an INFO score >0.4. \n\nCorrelations between individuals\u2019 genetic ancestry fractions and PRS were done using Pearson\u2019s correlation (  R  ) using the cor.test function in base R v3.5.1 ( ). Genetic ancestry fractions range from 0 to 0.925, and PRS values range from 0 to 1. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Ethnicity and Genetic Ancestry \n  \nThe Colombian census reports the ethnic composition of the country as 85.9% Mestizo, 10.6% Afro-Colombian, and 3.4% Indigenous ( ). There is high variation in the distribution of ethnic groups among Colombia\u2019s administrative departments and geographic regions ( ;  ). The percent Mestizo population of individual departments ranges from 5.2% in the department of Choc\u00f3 in the western Pac\u00edfico region to 98.4% in the capital district of Bogot\u00e1. Afro-Colombian population percentages range from 1.0% for the department of Guain\u00eda in the eastern Amazon\u00eda region to 82.1% in Choc\u00f3. Indigenous percentages range from 0.1% on the Caribbean Islands of San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia to 66.7% for the Vaup\u00e9s department in the southeastern Amazon\u00eda region. Broadly speaking, Mestizo population composition is highest in the central Andes region, Afro-Colombian populations are concentrated in the Pac\u00edfico and Caribe regions along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and Indigenous populations are highest in the Amazon\u00eda region ( ). \n  \nEthnic group population percentages for the five broad geographic regions and the entire country. \n    \nEthnic groups geographic distributions. Percentages of Mestizo (orange), Afro-Colombian (blue), and Indigenous (red) populations among Colombia\u2019s administrative departments. \n  \nWhole genome genotype data were characterized for a cohort of 624 individuals sampled from the city of Medell\u00edn in the department of Antioquia and 99 individuals sampled from Quibd\u00f3 in the department of Choc\u00f3 ( ). Comparison of individual WGG data from these samples with WGS data from European, African, and Native American ancestry reference populations shows evidence of substantial admixture for all three continental ancestry components. The Medell\u00edn sample characterized here is similar, but substantially more ancestrally diverse, compared to the previously characterized 1KGP population from Colombia, and falls between reference populations corresponding to European, African, and Native American ancestry ( ). The Choc\u00f3 sample is closer to the African American and African Caribbean 1KGP populations. \n  \nGenetic ancestry and admixture.

(E)   Population average ancestry fractions for the for the Medell\u00edn and Choc\u00f3 cohorts. Population abbreviations: 1KGP \u2013 1,000 Genomes Project, ChocoGen \u2013 Chocoano in Quibd\u00f3, Colombia, UniCES \u2013 Cosmopolitan Colombian in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. \n  \nThe program ADMIXTURE was used to quantify ancestry components for the Colombian genomes analyzed here. ADMIXTURE was run for   K  =2\u201310 ancestry components, with   K  =3 ancestry components showing the best fit to the data. ADMIXTURE analysis confirms the ancestral diversity of the two Colombian cohorts: the Medell\u00edn cohort shows an average of 55.0% European ancestry, 32.4% Native American ancestry, and 12.6% African ancestry, and the Choc\u00f3 cohort shows an average of 76.0% African ancestry, 12.5% Native American ancestry, and 11.5% European ancestry ( \u2013 ). All of the Colombian genomes analyzed here show evidence of admixture with two or more ancestry components, with a minimum non-European ancestry component of 7.5%. European ancestry percentages for individual Colombian genomes studied here range from 2.5 to 92.5%, Native American ancestry from 1.3 to 73.6%, and African ancestry from 0.0 to 92.1%, underscoring the diversity of Colombian populations. \n\n\n### Ethnicity, Disease Prevalence, and Comorbidities \n  \nDepartment disease prevalence values, expressed as the age- and sex-adjusted number of cases per 100,000 individuals, were recorded for six health conditions and eight cancers prioritized as high impact by Colombian governmental and non-governmental organizations ( ). Malaria shows the highest prevalence for the six prioritized non-cancer health conditions, with a per-department average of 618.5 cases per 100,000 individuals, followed by type 2 diabetes with 367.7 cases per 100,000. Breast cancer and prostate cancer were the most common cancer types, with prevalence values of 131.6 and 64.1 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. The highest combined prevalence for the six prioritized health conditions is seen for the departments of Guain\u00eda and Amazonas in the Amazon\u00eda region followed by Choc\u00f3 in the Pac\u00edfico region. Disease prevalence in these departments is dominated by Malaria, but the combined disease prevalence remains high when Malaria is not considered. The Islands of San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia are the exception to this trend with a high prevalence for non-Malaria conditions and little to no risk of Malaria. The highest combined prevalence across all eight cancers is seen for the departments of Risaralda, Antioquia, and the capital district of Bogot\u00e1, all of which are located in the central Andes region. \n\nPercentages of Mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous ethnic populations across departments were compared to the disease prevalence data. The combined prevalence of the six prioritized non-cancer conditions is positively correlated with Indigenous population percentages and negatively correlated with Mestizo percentages ( ). Cancer shows the opposite pattern, a positive correlation with Mestizo population percentages and a negative correlation with Indigenous percentages. Afro-Colombian population percentages show comparatively smaller correlations with disease prevalence, only slightly negative for the non-cancer conditions and slightly positive for the cancers. Mestizo and Indigenous population patterns are mirror images of each other with respect to the prevalence of the individual non-cancer conditions and cancer ( ). Indigenous population percentages are positively correlated for six out of seven prioritized non-cancer conditions, whereas Mestizo and Afro-Colombian percentages are mostly negatively correlated with these same conditions. Malaria shows the highest overall correlations with ethnicity, with high positive correlations for both Afro-Colombian and Indigenous population percentages and the most extreme negative correlation with Mestizo percentages. Mestizo population percentages are positively correlated with seven out of eight cancer types and negatively correlated with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, whereas Indigenous percentages show the opposite patterns. \n  \nEthnicity and disease prevalence. Administrative department ethnic group percentages were correlated with disease prevalence data. Data are shown for the three largest ethnic groups in Colombia: Mestizo (orange), Afro-Colombian (blue), and Indigenous (red).   (A)   The overall correlation of ethnicity with disease prevalence was calculated by summing the disease-specific correlations for six non-cancer health conditions and eight cancers.   (B)   For each ethnic group, ethnicity-disease prevalence correlations are shown for six non-cancer conditions (top of each plot) and the eight cancers (bottom of each plot). \n  \nNon-cancer and cancer disease prevalence values were normalized within departments ( ), and the resulting relative disease prevalence values for all departments were correlated to calculate pairwise disease comorbidities among all departments. The resulting departmental pairwise comorbidity values were hierarchically clustered and compared to the departments\u2019 locations within Colombia\u2019s five geographic regions ( ). Population comorbidity values are highest around the diagonal line and correspond well with individual departments\u2019 locations within broad geographic regions. The tightest clustering of comorbidity values, indicating similar relative disease prevalence values for departments within a given region, is seen for the Amazon\u00eda and Andes regions, corresponding to their high percentages of Indigenous and Mestizo populations, respectively. The Caribe region also shows high population comorbidity, whereas the comorbidity values for the Pac\u00edfico region are lower, reflecting greater demographic diversity for the region ( ;  ;  ). \n  \nPopulation comorbidity and geography. Disease prevalence values were normalized for each administrative department by dividing the observed prevalence value for each disease with the maximum disease prevalence value for the department to yield relative disease prevalence values. The relative disease prevalence values were correlated between all pairs of departments to infer overall comorbidity levels, i.e., similar relative disease prevalence values, among departments and geographic regions. Positive disease prevalence correlations between departments are shown in red, and negative correlations are shown in purple. Administrative department names are shown to the left of the plot, and geographic region names are shown to the right of the plot, with locations indicated on the adjacent map. \n  \n\n### Genetic Ancestry and Predicted Disease Risk \n  \nGenetic risk estimates for four of the six of the prioritized non-cancer conditions and seven of the eight most common cancers were inferred using PRS computed on genomic variant data from the UniCES Medell\u00edn cohort studied here. Individuals\u2019 genetic ancestry percentages \u2013 European, African, and Native American \u2013 were regressed against PRS for each trait to evaluate the relationship between ancestry and predicted disease risk. \n\nEuropean genetic ancestry is significantly positively correlated with the predicted risk of gastric carcinoma and negatively correlated with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and breast carcinoma ( ). African genetic ancestry shows statistically significant correlations with the predicted risk for five out of 11 diseases evaluated, compared to three and one significant correlation(s) for European ancestry and Native American, respectively. African genetic ancestry is positively correlated with the predicted risk of type 2 diabetes, colorectal carcinoma, and prostate cancer, and negatively correlated with gastric carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. The only significant correlation seen for Native American genetic ancestry is the negative correlation with the predicted risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Overall, African genetic ancestry shows the highest effect on predicted disease risk, as measured by the sum of the absolute values of the ancestry-PRS correlations, followed by European ancestry and Native American ancestry, respectively ( ). African ancestry shows the highest overall positive correlation for predicted disease risk, as measured by the sum of the values of the ancestry-PRS correlations, whereas European ancestry shows the highest overall negative correlation with disease risk ( ). The overall correlation between Native American ancestry and predicted disease risk is negligible. Examples of regressions for individual ancestry-disease combinations are seen for European ancestry and breast carcinoma, African ancestry and type 2 diabetes, and Native American ancestry and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ). \n  \nGenetic ancestry and disease risk. Genetic ancestry percentages \u2013 European (orange), African (blue), and Native American (red) \u2013 and disease polygenic risk scores (PRS) were computed from participant genomic data and correlated.   (A)   Examples of correlations between genetic ancestry and PRS are shown for each of the three ancestries. Pearson correlation coefficient and   p  -values are shown for each.   (B)   Genetic ancestry-PRS correlations for all three ancestries and 11 health conditions or diseases are shown. Positive correlations are shown in red, and negative correlations are shown in blue. Correlation statistical significance levels are indicated (0.01<  p  <0.075=*, 0.001<  p  <0.01=**,   p  <0.001=***). The overall correlation of genetic ancestry with disease risk was calculated by summing the disease-specific correlations, absolute values   (C)   and raw correlations   (D)  , for the 11 conditions. \n  \n\n### Differences Between Observed Disease Prevalence and Predicted Disease Risk \n  \nWe analyzed the three major ethnic groups in Colombia \u2013 Mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous \u2013 in comparison with three corresponding genetic ancestry groups \u2013 European, African, and Native American. Both ethnicity and genetic ancestry show a number of significant correlations with observed disease prevalence and predicted disease risk. However, the direction of the disease correlations for the corresponding ethnicity and ancestry groups often do not match. In other words, a positive (or negative) correlation between ethnicity and observed disease prevalence among departments does not necessarily entail a positive (or negative) correlation between genetic ancestry and predicted disease risk for the individuals in the ancestrally diverse cohort studied here, as may be expected given the correlation between ancestry and ethnicity in Colombia. For Afro-Colombian ethnicity and African genetic ancestry there are six concordant ethnicity/ancestry-disease correlation pairs and five discordant correlation pairs ( ). For both Mestizo ethnicity-European genetic ancestry and Indigenous ethnicity-Native American genetic ancestry, there are four concordant correlation pairs and seven discordant pairs. \n  \nEthnicity and disease prevalence vs. genetic ancestry and disease risk. Correlation values for ethnicity and disease prevalence are plotted against correlation values for genetic ancestry and disease risk. Concordant correlations, both positive or both negative, are shown in the upper right and lower left quadrants, respectively. \n  \n\n### Human Development, Ethnicity, and Health \n  \nHealth outcomes are strongly influenced by a variety of socioeconomic factors. The HDI is a composite index that is used to measure three key aspects of human development: life expectancy, education, and income. HDI in Colombia is related to demography with marked differences seen for the three ethnic groups studied here. The Mestizo population percentage is positively correlated with HDI, whereas the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous population percentages are negatively correlated with HDI ( ). Differences in the level of economic development and human capital captured by HDI may explain the differences in population health outcomes observed here. The prevalence of prioritized non-cancer conditions, Malaria in particular, tend to be negatively correlated with HDI, whereas cancer is uniformly positively correlated with HDI ( ). Clearly, human development and socioeconomic factors are strongly related with health outcomes in Colombia. Nevertheless, the patterns of genetic admixture observed for the Colombian population, which to some extent blur the genetic ancestry distinctions among ethnic groups, may obscure the relationship between socioeconomic factors, genetic ancestry, and disease risk in the country. This may explain the discordance seen between ethnicity and disease prevalence vs. ancestry and disease risk. \n  \nEthnicity, socioeconomic status, and disease.   (A)   Human develop index (HDI) values for each administrative department are correlated with ethnic group population percentages for each department: Mestizo (orange), Afro-Colombian (blue), Indigenous (red). Each point represents a single department, and the linear trend is indicated for each ancestry along with 95% CI (shaded area). Pearson correlation coefficient and   p  -values are shown for each.   (B)   Correlations between prevalence and HDI are shown for six non-cancer conditions (top) and the eight cancers (bottom). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Ethnicity vs. Genetic Ancestry in Colombia \n  \nEthnic designations in Colombia are based on self-identification. In the 2005 census, individuals could choose from one of six ethnic categories, including Indigenous,   Rom  , three categories of Afro-Colombian groups, or none of the above ( ;  ). For this study, we focused on the three largest ethnic groups: Mestizo, which corresponds to the \u201cnone of the above\u201d option from the census, and may also include individuals who self-identify as white, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous. The   Rom   category from the census corresponds to the recently recognized Roma population, whose presence in the Americas dates to Columbus\u2019 earliest arrival but only make up 0.01% of the Colombian population. The small size of this ethnic group did not allow for sufficient resolution for the comparative analyses conducted here. \n\nIt is important to note that self-identified ethnicity is distinct from genetic ancestry as measured here. Colombians of all ethnicities show high levels of genetic admixture ( ;  ). Mestizos in particular have both substantial European and Native American genetic ancestry components and often show a small but not insubstantial African ancestry fraction as well. Even isolated Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Colombian communities show evidence of genetic admixture. Thus, while the ethnic categories used here are strongly correlated with genetic ancestry, they clearly do not capture the complexity of ancestry and admixture seen for the Colombian population. In addition to ancestry, self-identified ethnic categories also reflect individuals lived experiences, including many aspects of the environment and socioeconomic factors that can influence health outcomes. These distinctions between ethnicity and genetic ancestry may explain some of the differences observed between ethnic and genetic ancestry effects on disease prevalence and predicted risk observed here. \n\n\n### Implications for Colombia: Precision Public Health \n  \nThe strong relationship between ethnicity, ancestry, and health outcomes in Colombia support the adoption of the precision public health paradigm as a way to bring genomic medicine to the country. Precision public health is an alternative to precision medicine, as it entails focus on populations instead of individuals ( ,  ;  ). Precision public health relies on detailed health, demographic, and population genomic profiles of developing countries, which allows for the allocation of resources and efforts where they will be most effective. The hope is that an emphasis on population-level interventions will enable the emerging genomic technologies that underlie precision medicine to be efficiently implemented in developing countries. We recently showed how population genomic profiles can be used to guide pharmacogenetic decision making in Colombia in a way that targets resources to the populations, where they will generate the maximum benefit to health and the best return on investment ( ). The results reported here, particularly as they relate to the distinct health characteristics of different Colombian populations and regions, underscore the need to focus health intervention efforts in a population-specific way. To the extent that genomic approaches to healthcare are implemented in the country, they should be targeted to groups and areas where they can be expected to yield the most benefit and the least harm. This approach will need to be attuned to the differences between self-identified ethnicity and genetically measured ancestry demonstrated here. \n\n\n### Limitations of the Study and Future Directions \n  \nOne of the major limitations of this study is the lack of individual level health data for the cohort studied here. The ethnicity and disease prevalence data are reported at the level of administrative departments, which facilitates high-level comparisons but does not allow for detailed interrogation of the relationship between genetic ancestry and health. Future efforts to study the relationship between ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and health will be strengthened by the creation of population biobanks that include biological samples, deep phenotypic data, and electronic health records for individual participants. Biobanks also can and should include as many socioeconomic indicators as possible. Unfortunately, the goal of a country-level biobank, such as the United Kingdom Biobank or the United States All of Us project, remains out of reach for Colombia, at least for the time being. However, individual laboratories, including our own groups, are beginning to collaborate to marshal resources to create the kind of biobank data that will be needed to strengthen this line of research. \n\nThe use of different sources of data, both for disease prevalence values and for genome-wide genotyping, represents a potential source of bias in our study. However, this bias is likely mitigated by the choice of epidemiological databases and the methods for data harmonization used here. The disease prevalence databases were chosen as they are considered to be the most reliable epidemiological surveys of Colombia that are publicly available, with each database focused on a specific set of health conditions. For the two sources of genome-wide genotype data, we performed rigorous data quality control when harmonizing the data in an effort to avoid any potential bias. Visual inspection of the genomic relationships among individuals from each of the two genotype data sets does not point to any evidence of batch effects ( , ). \n\nAnother potential limitation of this study relates to the predictive utility of PRS in the kind of diverse, admixed populations such as the Colombian cohort studied here. The vast majority of PRS have been developed and validated on cohorts with European genetic ancestry, and PRS may not transfer well across populations with distinct ancestry profiles. The PRS used here were mined from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog,  and we only used PRS that were developed using cohorts that included two or more diverse ancestries in an effort to mitigate problems with cross-population portability. Nevertheless, the development and validation of PRS on admixed American populations, and for Colombian cohorts in particular, will certainly allow for more robust genetic risk prediction in the future. \n\nFinally, it should be noted that the results here apply to a single admixed American population within a single Latin American country. Latin American populations are highly diverse and characterized by distinct combinations of African, European, and Native American ancestry ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ). In addition, as we have shown here, Colombia itself is an ethnically diverse country with distinct ancestry profiles for different regions in the country ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Thus, the connections between ancestry and health outcomes reported here may or may not apply to other countries or even to different populations sampled within Colombia. Future studies of this kind in other countries, or other populations within Colombia, can shed light on the extent to which the trends observed here are unique or shared among populations. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nColombian ethnicity, disease prevalence, and HDI data are made freely available online as described in the Materials and Methods section, and are provided here as  .

Mitochondria create ATP for cellular energy via oxidative phosphorylation. The biology and genetics of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are complex with the components that make up the structure and control the function of the mitochondria being encoded for by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Any abnormality in these components can reduce the functional output of the oxidative phosphorylation system producing a wide range of diseases with marked genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Pathogenic variants have been described in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Current literature details at least 300 disease-causing genes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and this number continues to rise [ ]. \n\nThe gene   POLG   (   Ensembl:ENSG00000140521; MIM:   ), located on nuclear chromosome 15q, encodes for DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), an enzyme involved in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA [ ].   POLG   encodes the catalytic subunit, p140, of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol g). The p140 catalytic subunit is complexed to the dimeric p55 accessory subunit encoded by the   POLG2   gene [ ]. The p55 subunit functions as a processivity factor enhancing the complex affinity to DNA and allowing for very long stretch of DNA synthesis [ ]. Mutations in the   POLG   gene are the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disorders [ ], with around 300 known pathogenic variants currently described [ , ]. Mutations in this gene cause a spectrum of disorders with overlapping phenotypes, collectively described as   POLG   syndromes [ ]. These syndromes can include developmental delay, hypotonia [ , ] seizures (generalized, focal motor, myoclonic, and status epilepticus) [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ], stroke-like episodes [ ], movement disorders (chorea, parkinsonism) [ , , ], myopathy (ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, weakness, fatigue) [ , , , , ], ataxia [ , , , ], peripheral neuropathy [ , , ], psychomotor regression [ ], cardiomyopathy [ , ], and endocrinopathies (diabetes mellitus, primary ovarian or testicular failure) [ , , , , ]. Patients can present at any time from early childhood to late adulthood, depending on phenotype, typically with pediatric-onset disorders demonstrating mitochondrial DNA depletion and adult disorders showing accumulation of multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions on muscle analysis [ , , , , , , ]. The phenotypes of POLG are commonly categorized into six syndromes.   \n Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome   (AHS) is one of the most common and severe phenotypes. Children can have normal development for the first few months or even years of life but may have some degree of developmental delay that becomes apparent by age three years. Seizures are often the first sign of AHS and these commonly are partial or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures but children may present with status epilepticus. The epilepsy is resistant to antiepileptic drugs and often becomes intractable. Encephalopathy develops in a severe, progressive fashion and hepatic failure occurs with a wide range of variability. Valproic acid is contraindicated as rapid progression to end-stage liver failure is a well-described outcome in those treated with valproic acid or its derivatives [ , , , ,  ,  ]. \n  \n Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum   (MCHS) presents between the first few months to three years of life with developmental delay, lactic acidosis, myopathy, failure to thrive, pancreatitis, hearing loss, and dementia. MCHS can also include hepatic failure and renal tubular dysfunction [ ]. \n  \n Myoclonic epilepsy, myopathy, and sensory ataxia   (MEMSA) includes disorders previously described as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE) but now is used to refer to disorders with epilepsy, myopathy, and ataxia without ophthalmoplegia. Patients typically first present in young adulthood with cerebellar ataxia secondary to sensory neuropathy. Myopathic weakness usually develops in proximal muscle groups but can be distal. Many patients will go on to develop focal epilepsy with progression to generalized refractory epilepsy [ ]. \n  \n Ataxia neuropathy spectrum   (ANS) includes phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). Patients with ANS commonly have ataxia and varying degrees of sensorimotor neuropathy. Many also develop headaches, seizures, myoclonus, blindness, ophthalmoplegia, psychiatric disorders, and liver failure [ , , , ]. \n  \n Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia   (arPEO) is characterized by progressive extraocular muscle weakness. Strabismus and ptosis are often the only signs early on in the disease course [ ]. \n  \n Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia   (adPEO) involves more systemic features such as generalized myopathy and in some cases sensorineural hearing loss, depression, ataxia, axonal neuropathy, parkinsonism, and hypogonadism [ , , , , , ]. \n  \n\nRegardless of whether or not patients fall neatly into one of the described syndromic categories, patients with POLG syndromes generally present with epilepsy. Myoclonus is the most common presented seizure type and patients often develop status epilepticus or epilepsy partialis continua. The seizures become refractory to treatment and worsen prognosis [ ]. Valproic acid is contraindicated as it can precipitate or accelerate liver failure by inhibition of fatty acid beta-oxidation which impairs mitochondrial function [ , , , ]. Cognition declines at a variable rate with more rapid periods of decline during acute infectious illnesses. Somnolence, loss of receptive and expressive language, and memory deficits are commonly seen with neurodegeneration [ ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain often demonstrates T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the cortical and subcortical regions, particularly in the occipital lobes. Similar lesions are also seen in the thalamus and cerebellum [ ]. Electroencephalography (EEG) findings are variable but occipital discharges and slowing are frequently seen, as are rhythmic high-amplitude delta with superimposed spikes (RHADS) [ ]. The diagnostic gold standard for POLG related disorders is gene sequencing. Life expectancy is usually 3\u00a0months to 12\u00a0years from symptom onset. Here we describe a patient with a newly described pathogenic   POLG   variant in   trans   with a known pathogenic variant. Clinically, his phenotype had overlapping features of both AHS and MEMSA. \n\n\n## Case \n  \nOur patient was a 7-year-old male with an unremarkable birth and early childhood. His parents reported an explosive-onset of seizures at the age of 5\u00a0years. Seizures were difficult to control from the onset and at the time of his initial evaluation his parents reported he had failed numerous anti-epileptic medications and had therefore stopped all anti-epileptics. His parents reported daily myoclonic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and episodes of behavioral arrest suspicious for absence seizures. Functionally, his parents reported that he was able to walk, eat, swim, and play even though he was less verbal than prior to seizure onset and was falling behind in school. Physical examination was notable for generalized rigidity and a dystonic gait. Prolonged EEG recording was performed, demonstrating over 50 generalized-onset seizures within a 24-h period. Seizure semiology was myoclonic, absence, and tonic-clonic. Conservative management was attempted with anti-epileptic therapy with a decrease in daily seizures and an increase in cognitive function. \n\nThree months later, the patient developed status epilepticus prompting admission to our pediatric intensive care unit. He was febrile with a presumed viral infection. The status epilepticus was refractory to multiple anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) and EEG showed continuous epileptiform discharges in the right fronto-centro-temporal and right temporo-parietal areas. He was placed in chemically-induced burst suppression with pentobarbital. MRI brain showed confluent T2 hyperintensities in the right caudate head, right thalamus, and left parietotemporal cortex with restricted diffusion in the right thalamus. Follow-up MRI one week later showed new abnormal signal changes in the left ventral medulla. There were no significant renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or endocrine abnormalities. Despite aggressive ASD management, our patient continued to seize and mental status did not improve. After his third pentobarbital coma (total of >14\u00a0days in pentobarbital induced burst suppression with no improvement), the decision was made to terminally extubate under DNR code status. The patient died the day after extubation. \n\nGenetic epilepsy panel obtained prior to his last admission identified a pathogenic variant, c.1399G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.A467T), and a variant of unknown significance (VUS), c.2425A\u00a0>\u00a0G (p.S809R), in the   POLG   gene. VUS were also identified in   SCN2A  ,   SCN9A  , and   CNTNAP2   genes but none had features suggestive of pathogenicity. The child's mother was found to have the c.2425A\u00a0>\u00a0G variant but not the c.1399G\u00a0>\u00a0A variant. Father was not available for testing. Muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis revealed no structurally pathologic findings but mitochondrial DNA content was 23% of the mean value of age and tissue-matched controls. Analysis for mitochondrial DNA deletions was not performed. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur patient presented with a clinical phenotype including overlapping features of both AHS and MEMSA. The c.1399G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.A467T) variant is one of the most common   POLG   disease mutations occurring in ~0.6% of certain populations [ ] and is considered to be a \u201cfounder\u201d mutation. The wild type residue, Ala467, resides in the DNA-interacting thumb domain and is important for the p55 subunit interaction that allows for highly processive DNA synthesis [ ]. Alteration to Ala causes disruption of the p140-p55 interaction, reduced processivity and decreased DNA polymerase activity [ ]. The p.A467T mutation has been identified alone in adPEO and in combination with other pathogenic variants in every other phenotypic form of POLG syndrome. The undescribed c.2425A\u00a0>\u00a0G variant, causing an amino acid change from Ser to Arg is suspected to be pathogenic as it is located in a highly conserved region of   POLG   ( ). The Ser809 residue located in the thumb domain which is important for DNA binding on one side and interacting with the accessory subunit on the other side ( A) [ , ]. The Ser side chain is positioned to interact with the peripheral thumb domain alpha-helix which makes contact with the accessory subunit ( B). A change of this residue to Arg ( C) could alter the binding capacity of the enzyme to the p55 accessory subunit or DNA or could affect the enzyme's stability thus producing the phenotype seen in this child. Heterozygotes would likely be able to partially compensate for this reduced processivity with a functional wild-type enzyme; however, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes would not be able to compensate. Our patient's muscle biopsy demonstrated a severe reduction in mitochondrial DNA content to 23% of control, suggesting an inability to properly process mitochondrial DNA in this patient. Although tragic, this case serves to describe a new pathogenic variant in the   POLG   gene associated with disease.   \nConservation of POLG amino acid sequence from across eukaryotes.

Compared to proliferating cells, senescent cells express distinct subsets of proteins. In this study, we used cultured human diploid fibroblasts rendered senescent through replicative exhaustion or ionizing radiation to identify proteins differentially expressed during senescence. We identified acid ceramidase (ASAH1), a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid, as being highly elevated in senescent cells. This increase in ASAH1 levels in senescent cells was associated with a rise in the levels of   ASAH1   mRNA and a robust increase in ASAH1 protein stability. Furthermore, silencing ASAH1 in pre-senescent fibroblasts decreased the levels of senescence proteins p16, p21, and p53, and reduced the activity of the senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase. Interestingly, depletion of ASAH1 in pre-senescent cells sensitized these cells to the senolytics Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q). Together, our study indicates that ASAH1 promotes senescence, protects senescent cells, and confers resistance against senolytic drugs. Given that inhibiting ASAH1 sensitizes cells towards senolysis, this enzyme represents an attractive therapeutic target in interventions aimed at eliminating senescent cells. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSenescence is a phenotype associated with indefinite growth arrest of the cell, first observed by Hayflick [ ]. Senescence can be induced by telomere shortening, genomic injury, epigenomic damage, signaling from oncoproteins, and other sublethal stresses. Senescent cells can also be identified by morphological changes including an enlarged and flattened shape, the presence of vacuoles, and irregular-shaped nuclei [ ]. Biochemical changes include DNA damage, increased levels of TP53 (p53), CDKN1A (p21), and CDKN2A (p16), and increased function of a senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2Gal) active at pH 6 [ ,  ]. Although senescent cells do not divide, they remain metabolically active [ ,  ]; this metabolic profile includes enhanced lysosomal activity associated with both growth arrest and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), whereby many proteins are secreted, including interleukin (IL) 6 and IL8 [ ,  ]. Lysosomal dysfunction is also linked to mitochondrial turnover and autophagy, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered metabolic activities [ ]. \n\nSenescence can be beneficial in young organisms by enabling tissue remodeling, embryonic development, wound healing, and suppression of tumorigenesis [ \u2013 ]. However, it can be detrimental in old organisms as senescent cells accumulate over time and promote premature aging and aging-associated conditions such as atherosclerosis, liver fibrosis, insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic inflammation, and cancer [ ,  \u2013 ]. Accordingly, some age-associated diseases were found to improve through the clearance of senescent cells using genetic approaches or senolytic drugs [ ,  ]. In mouse models, first-generation senolytics were used successfully to clear senescent cells in atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Ongoing studies in humans employ targeted senolytics for the treatment of eye diseases and osteoarthritis [ ]. The transgene INK-ATTAC was used in mouse models for the inducible clearance of p16-positive senescent cells leading to an improvement in age-associated pathologies such as sarcopenia, loss of adiposity, cataracts, cardiac hypertrophy, kidney disease, cancer, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and neurodegeneration [ ]. The clearance of senescent cells using senolytic drugs was similarly beneficial towards cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes, sarcopenia, and osteoarthritis [ \u2013 ]. \n\nGiven that senescent cells accumulate with age and promote age-related diseases, there is growing interest in identifying factors that can eliminate senescent cells more efficiently. Here, we used transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify such factors. Our studies revealed robustly increased expression levels of the lysosomal enzyme ASAH1 (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1; acid ceramidase) in WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts rendered senescent by either replicative exhaustion or exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). ASAH1 catalyzes the conversion of ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid and has been associated with pathologies such as Farber\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, diabetes, and spinal muscular atrophy [ \u2013 ]. We found a striking increase in ASAH1 protein levels in senescent cells that was independent of mRNA localization, stability, or translation; instead, ASAH1 protein was more stable in senescent cells than in proliferating cells, at least in part due to a decrease in proteasome-mediated ASAH1 degradation. Furthermore, silencing ASAH1 in pre-senescent fibroblasts decreased the levels of the senescence markers p16, p21 and p53, and also reduced the activity of the SA-\u03b2Gal. Interestingly, selective inhibition of ASAH1 using Acid Ceramidase Inhibitor IV (ACi) enhanced death of senescent cells but not proliferating cells and was further exacerbated by addition of the senolytics Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q). This decrease in cell viability was linked to an increase in caspase activity. Similarly, silencing ASAH1 sensitized pre-senescent cells to D+Q, likely by reprogramming them to death through apoptosis. Together, our findings suggest that ASAH1 promotes senescence and senescent-cell resistance to senolytics, underscoring its possible use in senotherapy. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Cell culture, replicative senescence, and SA-\u03b2Gal assays \n  \nWI-38 human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), and non-essential amino acids (Gibco) in a 5% CO  incubator. Primary human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were obtained as cryopreserved secondary cultures from LifeLine Cell Technology and maintained in VascuLife\u00ae SMC Medium Complete Kit from LifeLine Cell Technology following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \n\nProliferating WI-38 cells were used at low population doubling levels (PDL) ranging between PDL20 and PDL24. Replicative senescence was achieved by passaging WI-38 cells in culture until their growth rate decreased indicating that a senescent state had been attained (PDL48 to PDL52). Senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2Gal) activity in WI-38 cells was assessed following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Cell Signaling Technology). Cellular senescence was quantified using SPiDER-\u03b2Gal analysis following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Briefly, cells were seeded overnight at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10  in triplicate in a 96-well plate. The following day, cells were counted using the Cell Count normalization assay following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Fluorescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor plate reader at excitation 350 nm, emission 461 nm. The same plate was then used for the SPiDER-\u03b2Gal assay. Cells were lysed at 25\u00b0 C for 10 min; 50 \u03bcl of SPiDER-\u03b2Gal working solution was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO  for 60 min; 100 \u03bcl of Stop Solution was then added to each well. Fluorescence was measured using a Promega Glomax Explorer at 520 nm excitation, 580-620 nm emission. Normalized SA-\u03b2Gal activity was calculated by this formula: (Fluorescent intensity of SA-\u03b2Gal activity) / (Fluorescent intensity of cell number \u2013 Fluorescent intensity of blank). \n\n\n### Transfection and treatments \n  \nPre-senescent (PDL38 to PDL45) WI-38 fibroblasts were seeded in triplicate overnight at 2.5\u00d710  cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate for ~50% confluence by the next day. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) in 1 ml Optimem (Gibco) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Control siRNA (sc-37007) or ASAH1 siRNA (sc-105032) were used at 35 nM for 48 h. Proliferating (P, PDL20-24) and replicatively senescent (S, PDL48-52) cells were treated with either DMSO (control vehicle) or the inhibitor of RNA polymerase II Actinomycin D (Sigma) (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) followed by RNA isolation to test mRNA stability. For ionizing radiation (IR)-induced senescence, proliferating (PDL20-24) WI-38 cells were exposed to 10 Gy and harvested 10 days later. For cycloheximide (CHX) treatments, proliferating (PDL20-24) and replicative senescent (PDL48-52) cells were treated with either DMSO (control vehicle) or 50 \u03bcg/ml CHX for 0, 1, 2 or 4 h. For MG132 treatments, proliferating (PDL20-24) and replicative senescent (PDL48-52) cells were treated with either ethanol (control vehicle), or 10 \u03bcM MG132 for 0, 2, 4 or 6 h. Cells were treated with (ACi; Calbiochem, ACI IV, BOC, Cat# 533371) at 50 \u03bcM for 48 h. \n\n\n### Protein analysis \n  \nCell pellets were washed twice in cold PBS, the supernatant was discarded, and cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by sonication for 5 min. The sonicated samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 25\u00b0 C to remove the insoluble fraction. The remaining supernatant was the whole-cell lysate. Lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad). Incubations with primary antibodies recognizing ASAH1 (sc-136275), p21 (CDKN1A), p53 (TP53) (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as well as an antibody recognizing p16 (CDKN2A, from BD Biosciences), were followed by incubations with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). The levels of proteins GAPDH, \u03b2-actin (ACTB), and HSP90 (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which displayed unchanged levels, were monitored to control for loading. Signals were developed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) and acquired by KwikQuant Imaging System (Kindle Biosciences). Proteomic data are displayed in  . \n\n\n### RNA isolation, sequencing, and RT-qPCR analysis \n  \nRNA was isolated from WI-38 fibroblasts using Direct-zol RNA kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Zymo Research). RNA-seq analyses of proliferating and senescent cells (replicative or IR-induced senescence) were performed as described in [ ], and the data are available at GEO accession number GSE85771 [ ]. Total RNA was used for gene expression analysis by reverse transcription (RT) followed by quantitative (q)PCR analysis. RT was performed by using random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (Maxima Reverse Transcriptase, Thermo Fisher) and qPCR analysis was carried out using gene-specific primers and SYBR green master mix (Kapa Biosystems) using QuantStudio5 (Thermo Fisher). PCR primer pairs (each forward and reverse) were as follows: GGAGTTGCGTCGCCTTAGT and TGGTCCTGAAGGAGGATAGG for   ASAH1   mRNA, GTAAAGAAGCTGCCCAGCAC and GCCGGTGAGTGAGCTTGAG for   ASAH1   pre-mRNA, CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC and CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT for   ACTB   mRNA, CTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTCGAC and ACGACCAAATCCGTTGACTC for   GAPDH   mRNA, CGAACGTCTGCCCTATCAACTT and ACCCGTGGTCACCATGGTA for   18S   rRNA, and CCTGCCCAAGCTCTACCTT and AAGGCAGAAGATGTAGAGC for   p21   mRNA, GAGCTGGGGAATGGGACT and TGATGGCATGGACTGTGG for   GAPDH   pre-mRNA, CAAAACTCCCGTGCTGATCA and GGCTGGAGTGCAGTGGCTAT for   7SL   RNA, GCTGTGGAGTTCTTAAATATCAACC and TTCTCAATCCTGAAATCCCCTA for   MALAT1   RNA, and TTCTCTCCGTCCTCGGATTCTCTG and TCTTCTTGTTCCTCCTCAGAGTCG for   MYC   mRNA. \n\n\n### Polyribosome fractionation \n  \nCells were incubated with cycloheximide (Calbiochem; 100 \u03bcg/ml, 15 min) and the cytoplasmic lysates were prepared in polysome extraction buffer (PEB), fractionated by centrifugation through 10\u201350% linear sucrose gradients, and divided into 12 fractions for RT-qPCR analysis, as described [ ]. \n\n\n### Cell cycle analysis \n  \nPre-senescent (PDL41) WI-38 cells were transfected with Control siRNA or ASAH1 siRNA as described previously. After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 5 min at 25\u00b0 C; after brief centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was incubated with RNase A (10 \u03bcg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]) at 37\u00b0 C for 15 min; following a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated and 200 \u03bcl of 2 \u03bcg/ml propidium iodide was added. After incubation in the dark for 10 min, flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACS Canto for cell cycle analysis. \n\n\n### Caspase 3/7 activity \n  \nApoptosis was monitored by measuring Caspase 3/7 activity using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay System (Promega). Briefly, Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 solution at 25\u00b0 C was added directly to the cells, mixed vigorously for 30 sec, and incubated at 25\u00b0 C in the dark for 30 to 180 min. Luminescence was then measured using a GloMax plate reader (Promega). \n\n\n### Mass spec and targeted mass spec (metabolomics) \n  \nCells were harvested from 10-cm dishes individually from each of these groups: proliferating, replicative senescent, senescent after IR, Control siRNA, and ASAH1 siRNA. A minimum of 7 replicates were collected for each group with a minimum of 3\u00d710  cells collected per replicate. The cells were centrifuged and washed twice in cold PBS. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was frozen at -80\u00b0 C. These frozen pellets were then used for targeted metabolomics using the BIOCRATES MxP Quant 500 Kit to assay approximately 40 metabolites within the following classes: (1) Ceramides, (2) Fatty acids, and (3) Sphingomyelins. Metabolites were extracted and concentrations were measured at Biocrates Life Sciences AG (Innsbruck, Austria) in pmol/106 cells. Targeted metabolomics was performed using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates MxP\u00ae Quant 500 Kit (Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria). Briefly, metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Lipids specifically were measured by flow injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) using a 5500 QTRAP\u00ae instrument (AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) with an electrospray ionization source, and small molecules were measured by LC-MS/MS using the same 5500 QTRAP\u00ae instrument. Measurement techniques are described at   and  . A 96-well-based sample preparation device with internal standards was used to measure metabolite concentration in each sample (predefined sample amount). Next, a phenyl isothiocyanate solution was used to derivatize select classes of metabolites, and the target analytes were extracted with an organic solvent, followed by a dilution step. The extracts were then analyzed by FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS methods using multiple reaction monitoring to detect the analytes. Data were quantified using mass spectrometry software (Sciex Analyst\u00ae) and imported into Biocrates MetIDQ\u2122 software for further analysis. Metabolite values (pmol/10  cells) below the limit of detection (LOD) or above the limit of quantification (ULOQ) were excluded from analyses. A proportional odds model [ ], ordered logistic model and generalization of the non-parametric Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests, was used to compare metabolite concentrations across three comparisons: Replicative senescence vs Proliferating cell control, IR-induced senescence vs Proliferating cell control, and ASAH1 siRNA vs Control siRNA. Estimates for comparisons with minimal sample size (i.e., only 1 or 2 metabolite measurements per group) could not be accurately estimated by the model and were excluded. Log odds ratios (OR; e.g., the increased or decreased odds of a higher metabolite concentration in one group compared to the other) and results significant at p < 0.05 were indicated. Complete analysis results are included in  . \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### ASAH1 levels increase in senescent cells \n  \nWe used proliferating (\u2018P\u2019, early population doubling level, PDL22) primary human WI-38 fibroblasts to obtain senescent cells either by replicative exhaustion (\u2018S\u2019, PDL52) or by treatment with ionizing radiation (\u2018IR\u2019, 10 Gy followed by culture for 10 additional days). Senescence was assessed by monitoring SA-\u03b2Gal activity and the levels of senescence-associated markers p16 and p53 in both models ( ,  ;  ). To assess the changes in protein levels, whole-cell protein lysates prepared from proliferating and senescent cells were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis ( ). We also extracted whole-cell RNA from proliferating and senescent cells and performed RNA-seq analysis using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument at a depth of 75 million unidirectional reads for a total of 150 million paired-end reads per sample (GEO number GSE85771) [ ]. In this analysis, we compared upregulated proteins and RNAs in replicative and IR-induced senescence ( ;  ). We observed that both   DPP4   mRNA and DPP4 protein were highly expressed, as we previously reported [ ]. In addition, we observed that acid ceramidase (ASAH1) was upregulated in this comparison at both the protein and mRNA levels ( ). We also detected increased expression of ASAH1 upon doxorubicin-induced senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) ( ). The increase in   ASAH1   mRNA levels in replicative (S) and IR-induced senescence was validated by RT-qPCR analysis. These senescent cells also displayed elevated levels of   p21   mRNA ( ). Western blot analysis showed a robust increase in ASAH1 expression in both models of cell senescence ( ). In sum, ASAH1 protein levels increase strongly in senescent fibroblasts. \n  \n ASAH1 is highly expressed in senescent cells.   (  A  ) Senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2Gal) staining of WI-38 fibroblasts that were proliferating (P, PDL25) or were rendered senescent (S, PDL52) by extended culture or by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR, 10 Gy) and assayed 10 days later. (  B  ) Western blot analysis of senescence marker proteins p16 and p53 in cells prepared as described in (  A  ). The levels of loading control HSP90 were also assessed. (  C  )   Left  , Venn diagram showing commonly upregulated mRNAs (RNA-sequencing data) and proteins obtained by mass spec (MS) analysis (full list provided as  ) in replicative senescence (S) and IR-induced senescence relative to proliferating (P) fibroblasts.   Right  , partial list of the shared mRNAs and proteins upregulated in senescent cells. (  D  ,   E  ) In cells that were processed as in (  A  ), the steady-state levels of   p21   and   ASAH1   mRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR analysis (mRNA levels were normalized to   GAPDH   mRNA levels), and the levels of ASAH1 were assessed by Western blot analysis (loading control protein GAPDH was included). Data in (  D  ) are the means \u00b1S.D. of three biological replicates; data in (  A  ,   B  ,   E  ) are representative of three biological replicates. RNA-seq is provided in GSE85771. \n  \n\n### Altered ceramide metabolites in senescent cells \n  \nWe then explored whether metabolites relevant to ASAH1 function \u2013 that is, ceramides, fatty acids and sphingomyelins \u2013 were altered in senescence ( ; results across all metabolites are included in  ; \u2018Replicatively Senescent vs Proliferating\u2019 and \u2018IR Senescent vs Proliferating\u2019). When comparing replicatively senescent to proliferating control cells ( ) we found that one ceramide [Cer(d18:2/22:0)] and eight sphingomyelins [SM (OH) C16:1, SM C24:0, SM (OH) C24:1, SM C18:0, SM C24:1, SM (OH) C22:1, SM C26:1, SM (OH) C22:2] were significantly higher (log OR > 1; p < 0.05) in replicative senescence. When comparing IR-induced senescence to proliferating control cells ( ) we found that one ceramide [Cer(d18:1/24:1)] and two sphingomyelins [SM C16:0, SM C16:1] were significantly lower (log OR < 1; p < 0.05) in IR-induced senescence. Against our prediction, we did not observe an overlap or common changes in ASAH1-related metabolites between replicative and IR-induced senescence. The discrepancies could be dependent on the specific induction pathways, in this case replicative or IR-induced senescence, or heterogeneity of the senescent cells. Thus, these data suggest that while ASAH1-related metabolites may be altered in senescence, these two models of senescence do not share the metabolomic alterations. \n  \n Altered ASAH1-related metabolites in senescence.   (  A  ) Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway of ceramides conversion to sphingosine and fatty acids by ASAH1. Ceramides are also converted to sphingomyelin during sphingolipid biosynthesis or generated during sphingolipid recycling. (  B  ,   C  ) Metabolomic analysis of the levels of ceramides, fatty acids, and sphingomyelin during replicative (  B  ) or IR-induced (  C  ) senescence. Dashed lines indicate p < 0.05. The x-axis indicates the categories and individual metabolites. Red bars indicate a log odds ratio (OR) > 1: an increased log odds of a higher metabolite concentration in the Replicatively senescent (  B  ) or IR-induced senescent (  C  ) group relative to the comparison group (Proliferating). Blue bars indicate a log odds ratio (OR) < 1: a decreased log odds of a higher metabolite concentration in the Replicatively senescent (  B  ) or IR-induced senescent (  C  ) group relative to the comparison group (Proliferating). Significant metabolites are highlighted in the table below each graph. \n  \n\n### The rise in ASAH1 levels occurs largely independently of increased   ASAH1   mRNA stability or translation \n  \nTo understand whether the twofold increase in   ASAH1   mRNA levels in senescent cells is due to a rise in transcription, we measured the levels of   ASAH1   pre-mRNA (a surrogate of   ASAH1   gene transcription) by RT-qPCR analysis using primers that amplify exon-intron junctions. As shown in  , there were no significant changes in   ASAH1   pre-mRNA levels in senescent cells, suggesting that the increase in   ASAH1   mRNA levels in senescent cells was not due to elevated transcription ( ). To study if   ASAH1   mRNA was more stable in senescent cells upon replicative exhaustion, we treated fibroblasts with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor Actinomycin D in order to block transcription and measure by RT-qPCR analysis the rate of mRNA clearance (the half-life) in proliferating and senescent cells. As shown in  , the   ASAH1   mRNA was very stable in both senescent and proliferating cells; the half-life appeared to be longer than 8 hours, and thus could not be measured by treatment with Actinomycin D, as this drug is quite toxic to cells beyond 8 hours of continuous exposure. As controls, we measured the decay of the labile   MYC   mRNA [ ], and the stable   GAPDH   mRNA ( ). The relative levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic   ASAH1   mRNA were also unchanged with senescence ( ). We assayed the levels of noncoding RNAs   7SL   and   MALAT1   as cytoplasmic and nuclear controls, respectively ( ) [ ,  ]. In sum, while   ASAH1   mRNA may be slightly more stable in senescent cells to account for the twofold rise in levels in senescent cultures, we were not able to accurately calculate the half-lives. \n  \n  ASAH1   mRNA stability and translation in senescent cells.   (  A  ) RT-qPCR analysis of the levels of   ASAH1   and   GAPDH   pre-mRNAs using total RNA from proliferating (P) and senescent (S) cells upon replicative exhaustion and normalized to   GAPDH   mRNA levels. (  B  ) Proliferating and senescent cells were treated with Actinomycin D for the times indicated to block transcription; total RNA was then isolated, and RT-qPCR analysis was performed to assess the levels of   ASAH1   mRNA. The labile   MYC   mRNA and the stable   GAPDH   mRNA were included as control transcripts. Discontinuous line indicates 50% of the original levels of mRNAs at time 0. (  C  ) Cytoplasmic lysates obtained from P and S cells were fractionated through sucrose gradients to assess global polysome distribution profiles; \u2018Unbound RNA\u2019 fractions, fractions containing small ribosomal subunits (\u201840S\u2019), large ribosomal subunits (\u201860S\u2019), and monosomes (\u201880S\u2019), as well as polysomes of low and high molecular weight (LMWP and HMWP) are indicated. The relative distribution of   ASAH1   mRNA and housekeeping   ACTB   (  \u03b2-actin  ) mRNA was studied by RT-qPCR analysis of RNA in each of 12 gradient fractions. Data in (  A  ) and (  B  ) represent the means and S.D. from three independent experiments; data in C are representative of three independent experiments. \n  \nNext, we investigated the marked rise in ASAH1 protein levels. First, we tested whether ASAH1 translation may be elevated in senescent cells by fractionating the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell on sucrose gradients using standard procedures, as previously described [ ]. We collected fractions that were devoid of ribosome particles (unbound RNA, fractions 1 and 2), fractions containing ribosomal subunits and single ribosomes (fractions 3-5), low-molecular-weight polysomes (LMWP, fractions 6-8), and high-molecular-weight polysomes (HMWP, fractions 9-12). RNA was prepared from each fraction, and the levels of   ASAH1   mRNA in each fraction were calculated as a percentage of total   ASAH1   mRNA in the gradient. This analysis revealed only a slight shift in the distribution of   ASAH1   mRNA across polysome fractions, suggesting that increased translation does not contribute strongly to the rise in ASAH1 protein levels in senescent cells ( ). \n\nIn the absence of clear evidence from polysome analysis that ASAH1 translation was elevated, we examined whether ASAH1 protein stability was altered between proliferating and senescent cells. To assess the changes in ASAH1 protein stability, we treated proliferating and senescent cells with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of   de novo   translation, and monitored the clearance of ASAH1 by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, ASAH1 was markedly stable in senescent cells, while it was undetected in proliferating cells; the control protein GAPDH was stable in both populations ( ). To look at ASAH1 protein stability in a different way, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in  , ASAH1 protein was found to accumulate slightly in proliferating cells after four hours, but it was strongly induced after two hours of treatment with MG132 in senescent cells, as determined by Western blot analysis. We assessed the levels of the labile protein p21 to monitor the efficiency of the CHX and MG132 treatments ( ,  ). Recently, it has been shown that ASAH1 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome through UBTD1 (ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1) [ ]. These findings indicate that ASAH1 levels increase in senescent WI-38 fibroblasts largely due to enhanced protein stability. \n  \n Stability of the ASAH1 protein in proliferating and senescent cells.   (  A  ) Western blot analysis of the levels of ASAH1 and loading control GAPDH in cells harvested after treatment with either vehicle (DMSO) or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for the times shown. (  B  ) We assessed the levels of ASAH1 and control GAPDH in cells treated with either vehicle (ethanol) or 10 \u03bcM MG132 for indicated times by Western blot analysis. To monitor the efficiency of the treatments, we assessed the levels of the labile protein p21. \n  \n\n### Loss of ASAH1 suppresses cellular senescence and alters associated metabolites \n  \nTo understand the role of ASAH1 in senescence, we transfected pre-senescent WI-38 cells with ASAH1-directed siRNA to reduce ASAH1 levels or a control siRNA. Silencing ASAH1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, showing a robust reduction in cells transfected with ASAH1 siRNA compared to control cells ( ). ASAH1-depleted cells showed reduced levels of the senescence markers p16, p21, and p53 ( ). Furthermore, SA-\u03b2Gal analysis revealed a decrease in positive (blue) senescent cells following ASAH1 depletion; this finding was confirmed by the SPiDER-\u03b2Gal assay ( ,  ), supporting the notion that lowering ASAH1 levels suppressed cell senescence. Cell cycle analysis indicated that depletion of ASAH1 in pre-senescent cells (PDL41) increased S-phase cells compared to control cells ( ) suggesting that ASAH1-depleted cells are more proliferative. When comparing ASAH1 siRNA to control siRNA populations ( ; results for all metabolites are in   \u2013 \u2018ASAH1 vs Control siRNA\u2019) we found that sphingomyelins [SM C16:0, SM C16:1] were significantly decreased (log OR < 1; p < 0.05) in ASAH1-depleted cells. These changes may also be directly associated with ASAH1 silencing rather than senescence. Together, these data indicate that ASAH1 depletion reduces or delays cellular senescence and related metabolites, supporting a role for ASAH1 in promoting senescence. \n  \n Silencing ASAH1 represses senescence.   (  A  ) Pre-senescent cells were transfected with either control or ASAH1 siRNA; 48 h after transfection cells were harvested and whole-cell lysates prepared for Western blot analysis to examine the levels of ASAH1, p16, p21, p53, and loading control GAPDH. (  B  ,   C  ) Detection of the senescent marker SA-\u03b2Gal using traditional SA-\u03b2Gal staining (  B  ) and SPiDER-\u03b2Gal (  C  ) in the populations described in (  A  ).

The x-axis indicates the categories and individual metabolites. Red bars indicate a log odds ratio (OR) > 1: an increased log odds of a higher metabolite concentration in the ASAH1 group relative to the comparison group (Control siRNA). Blue bars indicate a log odds ratio (OR) < 1: a decreased log odds of a higher metabolite concentration in the ASAH1 group relative to the comparison group (Control siRNA). Significant metabolites are highlighted in the table below the graph. \n  \n\n### ASAH1 inhibition induces senescent cell death while ASAH1 depletion sensitizes cells to senolysis \n  \nSenescence is detrimental for organ homeostasis with advancing age [ ]. As senescent cells accumulate in aged tissue, they promote a range of age-related diseases and declines [ \u2013 ]; therefore, targeting and clearing senescent cells is clinically important. Senescent cell death has been achieved by a combination of Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D+Q), both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [ ]. Thus, we examined whether ASAH1 might be implicated in senolysis and senescent-cell viability. To test these possibilities, we used two approaches. First, we treated proliferating or senescent cells with the ASAH1 inhibitor IV (ACi) [ ] and monitored cell viability. As shown in  , treatments with ACi alone did not have a significant impact on the viability of proliferating cells, but reduced by ~20% the viability of senescent cells. Importantly, we also assessed the effect of ACi in combination with D+Q, to evaluate whether ACi could enhance senolysis. Indeed, although the combination of ACi and D+Q was more toxic than D+Q alone for proliferating cells, it strikingly enhanced the effectiveness of D+Q in reducing senescent-cell viability ( ). To better characterize the increased death of senescent cells caused by ACi, we assessed apoptosis by monitoring caspase 3/7 activity. Inhibition of ASAH1 significantly enhanced caspase 3/7 activity in senescent cells treated with the senolytics D+Q ( ) in agreement with the reduction in viability observed in  , while the different treatments did not influence caspase 3/7 activity in proliferating cells. To test if the reduction in viability caused by these drugs was due to apoptosis, we studied if the inhibitor of caspases ZVAD-FMK rescued cell death. As shown in  , treatment with ZVAD-FMK significantly reduced senescent cell death by either by either D+Q alone or D+Q in combination with ACi ( ). The reduction of caspase activity in these conditions was confirmed by performing a caspase 3/7 activity assay ( ). These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ASAH1 potentiates cell death caused by senolytics at least in part by increasing caspase activity. \n  \n ASAH1 is a potential senolytic target.   (  A  ,   B  ) Proliferating and senescent cells were either left untreated (DMSO) or treated with acid ceramidase inhibitor (ACi), with or without D+Q for 48 h, whereupon cell viability was assessed by direct cell counting (  A  ) and the activities of caspase 3/7 were assessed (  B  ). (  C  ,   D  ) Senescent cells were treated as in (  A  ), with addition of ZVAD-FMK (a pan-caspase inhibitor) whereupon cell viability was assessed by direct cell counting (  C  ) and caspase 3/7 activities were measured (  D  ). (  E  ) Proliferating or pre-senescent cells were transfected either with control or ASAH1 siRNA; two days after transfection, cells were treated with either control DMSO or D+Q for 48 h followed by assessment of cell viability by direct cell counting. (  F  ) Proposed model: in proliferating cells, ASAH1 is rapidly degraded by machineries that include the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, while in senescent cells, ASAH1 is stable, in turn promoting senescent cell survival and resistance to senolytic cell death. \n  \nWe then silenced ASAH1 in pre-senescent cells (PDL38-45) by transfection with ASAH1 siRNA and treated the cells with D+Q (see Materials and Methods). As shown, D+Q treatments decreased the number of viable proliferating and pre-senescent cells; however, pre-senescent cells were further sensitized to the toxicity of D+Q treatments if ASAH1 was inhibited, exhibiting more cell death than the untreated pre-senescent population ( ). Together, these data indicate that ASAH1 promotes senescent cell survival and resistance towards the senolytic combination D+Q ( ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of WI-38 fibroblasts revealed that ASAH1 levels were highly elevated after induction of senescence by either replicative exhaustion or exposure to ionizing radiation. Validation of these results by RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses indicated that senescence increased   ASAH1   mRNA about twofold, while ASAH1 protein levels were strongly elevated ( ). Senescent cells showed altered levels of ASAH1-related metabolites in replicative senescence and IR-induced senescence; these changes differed between the two senescence models ( ), likely due to the fact that replicative senescence is more gradual, occurring after a lengthy time in culture that spans ~5 months, while IR-induced senescence is acute and is achieved in only 10 days. The absence of shared changes may also depend on the mode of senescence induction. It is also possible that IR triggered the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide by a sphingomyelinase, as reported in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) [ ]. The lack of significant changes in ceramides could be attributed to other conversions such as galactosylceramide, glucosideceramide or ceramide I phosphate [ ,  ]. \n\nWe dedicated extensive efforts towards finding the mechanism responsible for the rise in ASAH1 in senescent cells. We found no evidence for strong control via transcriptional upregulation, mRNA stabilization or enhanced translation ( ), although we were not able to fully rule out if changes in   ASAH1   mRNA stability contributed to the enhanced expression of ASAH1 in senescence ( ). Instead, analysis of protein turnover indicated that ASAH1 is highly stable in senescent cells, while it is constitutively degraded in proliferating cells ( ). In support of these findings, Torrino et al., recently proposed that ASAH1 can be degraded   via   the ubiquitin proteasome pathway through UBTD1 [ ]. It will be important to test if UBTD levels or activity declines in senescent fibroblasts, although paradoxically, elevated UBTD1 was linked to cellular senescence through its ability to enhance the ubiquitination and degradation of MDM2 (a repressor of TP53) [ ]. While these molecular specifics await further study, we propose that the striking increase in ASAH1 abundance was largely due to enhanced ASAH1 protein stability in senescent cells. Further studies are needed to delineate in molecular detail the ubiquitination of ASAH1, the lysine residues modified, the ubiquitin ligase responsible, and the signaling pathway that might control the ubiquitination of ASAH1. \n\nThe accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and organs has been linked to the pathogenesis and severity of age-associated diseases such as cancer, arthritis, cataracts, neurodegeneration, and atherosclerosis [ ]. This accumulation is associated with metabolic reprogramming in senescent cells towards specific activities like elevated production of reactive oxygen species, the SASP trait, and lysosomal biogenesis [ ,  ]. As mentioned above, the lysosomal ASAH1 converts ceramides to fatty acids and sphingosine, which is then converted to sphingosine 1 phosphate. These metabolites play crucial roles in cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and survival [ ]. Accordingly, failure to maintain these metabolites in balance was associated with several age-associated conditions including cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, making ASAH1 an attractive therapeutic target [ ,  ,  ]. Given the growing interest in selectively eliminating senescent cells, we examined if depletion of ASAH1 altered senescence traits. We found that silencing ASAH1 decreased SA-\u03b2Gal activity, lowered senescence markers p16, p21, and p53, and reduced the concentration of ASAH1-related metabolites (sphingomyelins) as compared to control cells ( ). These findings suggest that ASAH1 may directly contribute to maintaining the senescence program and its depletion may either delay senescence or cause a shift towards other processes such as cell death. Additionally, reduced levels of ASAH1 may reverse the metabolic alterations observed in senescence. \n\nASAH1 has been linked to several malignancies, including glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, prostate cancer, and colon cancer [ \u2013 ]. Thus, ASAH1 inhibitors are gaining interest in cancer therapy and were found to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells; in this regard, ASAH1 inhibitors were shown to be effective in killing glioblastoma cancer stem cells as well as head and neck cancer cells (HNC) [ ,  ]. Therefore, we questioned whether ASAH1 plays a role in senescent cell survival, whether it can potentially be a target of senolysis, and whether inhibition of ASAH1 using ACi may be cytotoxic for senescent cells. Indeed, ACi did induce senescent cell death ( ). In line with this interesting effect, deletion of ASAH1 using CRISPR-Cas9 in A375 melanoma cells was found to disrupt ceramide metabolism and directed cells towards either apoptosis or senescence [ ], suggesting that ASAH1 may potentially be a therapeutic target for both cancer and senescence. It is worth noting that ACi enhanced senescent cell death and caspase 3/7 activity, which was further augmented in combination with D+Q ( \u2013 ). In an effort to exploit ASAH1 as a pharmacological target, several inhibitors have been developed for cancer therapeutics [ ]. Whether these or other novel ASAH1 inhibitors influence senescent cell survival in clinical settings remains to be tested. \n\nIt has been shown that ASAH1 promotes resistance of cancer cells to radiation therapy, and depletion of ASAH1 using RNAi improved the therapeutic response [ ]. Thus, we tested if depletion of ASAH1 influenced the efficacy of D+Q treatments. Strikingly, ASAH1-depleted cells were more susceptible to death when treated with D+Q than cells expressing normal ASAH1 levels ( ). While the activity of caspases 3/7 was initially increased in ASAH1 depleted cells, it was further enhanced by the D+Q treatments ( ). These data suggest that ASAH1 promotes senescent cell resistance to senolytics and its depletion improved the efficacy of the senolytics D+Q, likely due to the elevated activity of caspases ( ). In sum, we report here that ASAH1 is rapidly degraded in proliferating cells, while in senescent cells it remains stable and can promote cell survival and resistance to senolytics ( ). The roles of ASAH1 in senescence-associated processes such as inflammation and angiogenesis warrant future investigation. In closing, a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic changes driven by ASAH1 across senescence models is also needed in order to fully elucidate the value of ASAH1 in eliminating senescent cells and in sensitizing senescent cells towards the cytotoxic impact of established senolytics. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8266329, "text_md5": "d9e20affe6544cdaf10386063c8921bd", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 281], "journal": [282, 299], "publication_year": [301, 305], "title": [316, 364], "keywords": [378, 464], "abstract": [477, 1833], "body": [1842, 41228]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34102611, "doi": "10.18632/aging.203170", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8266329", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8266329"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8266329\">8266329</a>", "list_title": "PMC8266329  Acid ceramidase promotes senescent cell survival"}

Here, we show that Casz1, whose function is previously unknown in CD4  T cells, coordinates Th differentiation   in vitro   and   in vivo  . Casz1 deficiency in CD4  T cells lowers susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, consistent with the reduced frequency of Th17\u2009cells, despite an increase in Th1\u2009cells in mice. Loss of Casz1 in the context of mucosal   Candida   infection severely impairs Th17 and T  responses, and lowers the ability of the mice to clear the secondary infection. Importantly, in both the models, absence of Casz1 causes a significant diminution in IFN-\u03b3 IL-17A  double-positive inflammatory Th17\u2009cells (Th1* cells) in tissues   in vivo  . Transcriptome analyses of CD4  T cells lacking Casz1 show a signature consistent with defective Th17 differentiation. With regards to Th17 differentiation, Casz1 limits repressive histone marks and enables acquisition of permissive histone marks at Rorc, Il17a, Ahr, and Runx1 loci. Taken together, these data identify Casz1 as a new Th plasticity regulator having important clinical implications for autoimmune inflammation and mucosal immunity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs T helper (Th) cells play beneficial and detrimental roles depending on the cytokine milieu during immune responses ( \u2013 ), it is critical to identify the molecular mechanisms that control their differentiation and homeostasis ( ). Th differentiation involves a complex interplay among various transcription factors determining the expression and repression of relevant genes, which lead to stipulated and alternative cellular fates, respectively ( ,  ). In addition to direct genetic regulatory mechanisms, Th differentiation is regulated by permissive or repressive modifications of histones at relevant gene loci in the chromatin. Th1 and Th2 cells are classical subsets of CD4  T lymphocytes that play central roles in host defense against intracellular bacteria and parasites, respectively. Excessive responses by these cells lead to inflammation and allergy ( ). Th17\u2009cells are instrumental in mucosal host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi ( \u2013 ), but a hyperactive Th17 response results in tissue inflammation and autoimmunity, such as multiple sclerosis ( ,  ,  ). Transcription factors, such as RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)-\u03b1 and -\u03b3t, Ikaros, IRF4, FosL2, Runx1, and signal-transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 promote Th17 differentiation( ,  ,  ,  ), while c-Maf, STAT5, IL-2, and IL-27 restrain Th17 responses ( \u2013 ). They also determine the stabilization of committed cytokine production versus plasticity between Th subsets. Local cytokine cues in tissues and lymphoid organs selectively expand activated T cells of multiple T cell fates, or convert those to cells of another fate, thus generating intraclonal heterogeneity. For example, Th cells which produce both IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, known as Th1* cells or inflammatory Th17 (iTh17) cells infiltrate in the CNS and contribute to disease pathogenesis during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ( ). Also,   Candida albicans  \u2013specific Th17 clones can convert to IFN-\u03b3 IL-17A  Th1* cells or iTh17\u2009cells ( ,  ). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms instructing commitment versus plasticity in Th subsets in inflamed tissues will provide new therapeutic opportunities and insights for treating pathologies associated with Th responses ( ). \n\nCasz1 is an evolutionarily conserved zinc-finger transcription factor originally characterized in   Drosophila  , and required for reprogramming gene expression during neuronal and retinal cell differentiation ( \u2013 ). Casz1 is critical for the development of vasculature and differentiation of cardiomyocytes in   Xenopus   and mice ( ,  ), and human   CASZ1   locus has been linked to high blood pressure by genome-wide association studies ( ).   Casz1   is also a tumor-suppressor gene mapping to chromosome 1p36.22 in humans, which is deleted in neuroblastoma and other cancers ( ,  \u2013 ). However, the function of this protein in immune system is unknown. Our preliminary screening experiments showed that Casz1 mRNA is expressed in T cells, and the expression is differentially regulated in different Th subsets. These data rationalized our objective to examine the function of Casz1 in CD4 T cells. Here, we provide evidence that Casz1 regulates the Th17/Th1/regulatory cell differentiation program, at least in part by inducing Th17 signature genes and repressing Th1 signature genes   in vitro  . Casz1 also promotes EAE development as well as oral candidiasis infection recall responses that are Th17\u2009cell-dependent   in vivo  . Loss of inflammation and recall responses in Casz1 deficient mice coincided with reduction in iTh17 (IFN-\u03b3 IL-17A ) cells in tissues   in vivo  . Collectively, our findings identify Casz1 as a novel cell lineage-determining transcription factor and a potential therapeutic target for diseases involving Th cell-mediated responses. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Mice and Human Cells \n  \nExperiments were performed at Case Western Reserve University under approved protocols in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\u2019s guidelines. 6- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 and Foxp3  mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories and animals of both the genders were used. CD4 conditional   Casz1   deleted mice (CD4-cre Casz1 ) were generated as described in Supplementary Experimental Procedures in Supplementary Material. The CD4-Cre transgenic mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences, Inc. (Taconic NIAID Exchange 4196). C57BL/6 mice were used for back-crossing Casz1-F1 litters for at least 12 generations. Casz1 (WT) or Casz1 [Heterozygous (Ht)] littermate mice were used as controls for Casz1 knockout mice. Some replicate experiments, including EAE studies were done at NIAID, NIH under an approved protocol, and in compliance with the NIAID Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\u2019s guidelines. Human cells were obtained from commercially available PBMC (AllCells). \n\n\n### Reagents and Antibodies \n  \nPurified or fluorochrome conjugated \u03b1-CD3 (145-2C11), \u03b1-CD28, \u03b1-CD25 (3C7), CD4, CD25, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17F, IL-17A, IL-22, TNF-\u03b1, Foxp3, CD45, CD4, CD8, CD11C, and CD19 antibodies were all purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). Easysep CD4 isolation kits, and PE, biotin, and APC selection kits were purchased from Stemcell technologies (Vancouver, BC, Canada). Recombinant IL-23, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17A enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies were purchased from eBiosciences. Recombinant IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-7 were purchased from (BioBasic Inc., Amherst, NY, USA). Human TGF-\u03b21 was purchased from R&D systems. Mouse cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100\u2009U/ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml streptomycin, 2\u2009mM glutamine, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate, and 50\u2009\u00b5M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. \n\n\n### Th Differentiation \n  \nAll   in vitro   experiments using activated or polarized T cells were performed using CD4 T cells pooled from spleen (SPLN) and lymph nodes (LN) of 5\u201310 mice. CD4  CD44  CD25  na\u00efve T cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) were stimulated in U-bottom 96-well plates using 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml of plate-bound \u03b1-CD3 and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml \u03b1-CD28 antibodies under different Th polarizing conditions for 3\u20136\u2009days. To rule out T  contamination, we performed a staining on sorted na\u00efve cells on d0, which showed that more than 99% of the cells were Foxp3 negative. For non-polarizing conditions, CD4  na\u00efve cells were stimulated only with \u03b1-CD3 and \u03b1-CD28 antibodies with no added cytokines. Na\u00efve cells were polarized in Th1 conditioning milieu with recombinant mouse IL-12 (20\u2009ng/ml) and \u03b1-IL-4 (5\u2009\u00b5g/ml), Th2 milieu using \u03b1-IL-12 (5\u2009\u00b5g/ml) and IL-4 (25\u2009ng/ml), iT  milieu using TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2, and Th17 milieu using IL-6 (25\u2009ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (20\u2009ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (2\u2009ng/ml), \u03b1-IFN-\u03b3 (5\u2009\u00b5g/ml), and \u03b1-IL-4 (5\u2009\u00b5g/ml). For sub-optimal/partial Th17 polarization, \u03b1-IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b1-IL-4 antibodies were not added. Where indicated, CD90  T cell depleted splenocytes were added as antigen presenting cells (APC), at a T cell: APC ratio of 10:1 during the initiation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cultures. APCs were not added for iT  differentiation. In some experiments, na\u00efve CD4  T cells were carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE) labeled to assess their proliferation. To inhibit chromatin histone modifications, we stimulated the Ht (CD4-cre Casz1 ) and Casz1 deficient na\u00efve cells under Th17 conditions in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, 3-deazaneplanocin-A [DZNep; 1\u2009\u00b5M; enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) inhibitor], GSKS343 (5\u2009\u00b5M; EZH2 inhibitor), Trichostatin A (TSA; 100\u2009nM; HDAC inhibitor), and a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate (100\u2009\u00b5M; HDAC inhibitor) that were added 30\u2009min before the initiation of Th17 cultures. \n\n\n### q-RT PCR Analyses \n  \nFor q-RT PCR analyses of ROR-\u03b3t, Foxp3 IL-17A mRNA, na\u00efve CD4  T cells were stimulated in Th17 cultures as above and RNA was recovered using an RNA isolation Kit (BioBasic). When indicated, CD4  cells were separated from APC using CD90 magnetic beads to determine mRNA levels specifically in CD4  T cells. DNase (Ambion) was used to remove genomic DNA from purified RNA. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Mu-MLV reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (BioBasic), and was amplified with SYBR Green PCR Kit (BioBasic) in a real-time PCR machine (Biorad). All primers for PCR (BioBasic) were designed to amplify a coding region within a single exon. The relative amount of cDNA of interest was estimated from its Ct value plotted on a standard curve acquired from the Ct values of a diluted series of DNA. These quantified amounts were normalized to the amount of \u03b2-actin mRNA, assigning values of \u20181\u2019 to unstimulated or na\u00efve CD4  T cells that were used as control samples. \n\n\n### RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) \n  \nSample preparation, sequencing, and alignment: strand-specific whole transcriptome sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq  Stranded Total RNA LT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) by following the manufacturer\u2019s procedure. This protocol involved the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using biotinylated, target-specific oligos combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. The RNA was fragmented into small pieces and the cleaved RNA fragments were reverse-transcribed to generate single-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, followed by double-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. The resulting double-strand cDNA was used as the input to a standard Illumina library preparation with end-repair, indexed adapter ligation, and PCR amplification to generate sequencer-ready libraries. Six indexed RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 with Illumina TruSeq V4 chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The FASTQ files with 125\u2009bp paired-end reads were processed using Trimmomatic (version 0.30) to remove adaptor sequences. The trimmed FASTQ data were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38) with STAR (version 2.4.2a), which used GENCODE gtf file version 4 (Ensembl 78). STAR software also generated the strand-specific gene read counts. About 75% of 60 million reads per sample were uniquely mapped to the mouse genome for a total of 85% mapping rate. Differential expression analysis: the gene reads count data from Casz1 knockout and wild type control samples, each derived from three independent experiments were normalized with R Package limma (version 3.26.8), and analyzed with unpaired   t  -test. The normalized reads count data were used to generate   z  -scores for heatmap display. Pathway analysis and heat maps: the twofold differentially expressed gene list (Casz1 knockout versus wild type) was analyzed using QIAGEN\u2019s Ingenuity  Pathway Analysis (IPA , QIAGEN Redwood City,  , IPA Fall Release, September 2015) to generate unbiased molecular and cellular functional analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA software obtained from the Broad Institute ( ). The whole gene list (Casz1 knockout versus wild type) was pre-ranked based on   T  -value before uploading to the GSEA software for pathway analysis. Heatmaps for different cytokine signatures were created in R using the heatmap.2 function in g plots (version 2.17.0). \n\n\n### Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR \n  \nChromatin Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using fresh na\u00efve cells on day 4 (d4)   in vitro   activated Th17\u2009cells. In brief, after fixation in 1% formaldehyde, T cells were lysed for 10\u2009min on ice. Chromatin was sheared by sonication in Branson 2510 digital sonifier. Lysates equivalent to 10  cells were used   per   immunoprecipitation. After pre-clearing with protein-A agarose beads (Life technologies), cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2\u2009\u00b5l of \u03b1-H3K9me3, \u03b1-H3K27me3, \u03b1-H3K4me3, \u03b1-H4K12Ac, or control IgG antibodies (cell signaling). After washing and elution, crosslinks were reversed for 4\u2009h at 65\u00b0C. Eluted DNA was purified and samples were analyzed by qPCR. Data were normalized to input values and expressed as \u201c% input.\u201d Information on primers is provided in the supplementary experimental procedures in Supplementary Material. \n\n\n### Histology and Intracellular Staining of Cytokines and Proteins \n  \nFor immunocytochemical periodic acid schiffs (PAS) and hematoxylin and eosin staining, tongue tissues were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin overnight, and rehydrated in 70% ethanol. This was followed by paraffin sectioning and staining of paraffin sections (Histoserv, Inc., MD). For single-cell staining, cells were cultured as above, washed in PBS, fixed with Foxp3 fix-perm set (eBioSciences). For intracellular cytokine staining, cultures were re-stimulated with PMA (50\u2009ng/ml) and ionomycin (500\u2009ng/ml) for 4\u2009h, with brefeldin-A (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) added in last 2\u2009h. For pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 staining, the cells were washed, fixed, and were stained with Phosflow staining kit from BD Biosciences using manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \n\n\n### Flow Cytometry \n  \nData was acquired using BD Fortessa cytometers and were analyzed using FlowJo 9.8 software. \n\n\n###  In Vivo   Experiments \n  \n#### EAE Induction \n  \nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis experiments were performed using the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG )/Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA) and pertussis toxin kit (#EK0115) from Hooke\u2019s laboratories ( ). Age and sex matched WT and knockout mice, at least 5 per group were EAE induced according to the Hooke\u2019s laboratory protocol. EAE score criteria are provided in the supplementary experimental procedures in Supplementary Material. \n\n\n#### Oral   Candida   Infection in Mice \n  \nMice were infected as previously described ( ,  ). Briefly, they were sublingually infected under anesthesia by placing a 3\u2009mm diameter cotton ball saturated with 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910  Candida albicans   (SC-5314) blastospores for 90\u2009min. Mice were re-infected on d21 after primary infection for assessing the secondary immune responses   in vivo   ( ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \n P  -values were calculated by Student\u2019s   t  -test in Microsoft Excel software using unpaired data, two-way ANOVA test, or Mann\u2013Whitney test in Prism 6.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Casz1 Is Expressed in Mouse and Human CD4  T Lymphocytes \n  \nWe first confirmed the expression of Casz1 in various immune cells and found that Casz1 expression was much higher in CD4  T cells than other immune cells (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). These results prompted us to investigate the function of Casz1 in CD4  T cells. We then determined Casz1 mRNA expression in subsets of CD4  T cells using purified CD4 CD25 GFP CD44  (Na\u00efve), CD4 CD25 GFP regulatory T cells (T ), and CD4 GFP CD44  (effector/memory) from Foxp3  mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). We also stimulated na\u00efve cells with 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml of plate-bound \u03b1-CD3 and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml of soluble \u03b1-CD28 antibodies for 3\u2009days to determine its expression in   in vitro   activated CD4  T cells. Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that while na\u00efve CD4  cells and T  expressed relatively low levels of Casz1 mRNA, activated and memory CD4  T cells expressed threefold to fivefold higher levels of Casz1 mRNA (Figure  A). We also examined the mRNA levels of Foxp3 and IL-2 to confirm the phenotype of the cells we used. To determine the Casz1 expression kinetics at different time-points, we activated mouse and human na\u00efve cells using \u03b1-CD3/\u03b1-CD28 as above. Time kinetic analysis indicated that activation of murine CD4  cells showed biphasic regulation of Casz1 with levels rising fourfold within 3\u20136\u2009h after activation, declining by 44\u201370\u2009h, and then increasing fivefold after 72\u2009h and remaining elevated compared to na\u00efve cells for up to 5\u2009days after activation. Activated human CD4  cells showed a similar kinetics of CASZ1 expression (Figure  B), suggesting that Casz1 might have role during T cell activation. Furthermore, high Casz1 expression in   in vitro   induced Th0, Th1, and Th17 subsets, but reduced Casz1 expression in Th2 cells (Figure S3A in Supplementary Material), led us to investigate the function of Casz1 in these subsets. To this end, we generated a mouse line with loxP-flanked   Casz1   alleles (Casz1 ) (Figure S3B in Supplementary Material), crossed these mice with those expressing Cre recombinase under CD4 promoter ( ), and obtained CD4-cre Casz1  mice with targeted deletion of   Casz1   in the CD4 cell compartment (Figure S3C and Supplementary method in Supplementary Material). We backcrossed these mice with C57BL/6 mice for 12 generations before using the animals for experiments. qRT-PCR confirmed the absence of Casz1 mRNA expression in CD4-cre Casz1  mice, comparing those cells with na\u00efve and activated CD4  cells from CD4-cre Casz1  (WT) mice (Figure  C). While various   in vitro  -stimulated Th subset cells from WT mice showed variable levels of Casz1 mRNA, CD4-cre Casz1  (Casz1 knockout; Casz1 deficient) cells showed complete absence of Casz1 mRNA (Figure S3A in Supplementary Material). We observed highly selective ablation of Casz1 gene in Casz1 knockout cells, as Casz1 mRNA expression was intact in non-CD4 T cell fraction of the SPLN (Figure S3A in Supplementary Material). To examine the T cell development in these mice, we assessed the frequency of CD4 single positive (SP), CD4 CD8 double positive, and CD8 SP cell populations in thymus, SPLN, and peripheral LN. The frequency of CD4 SP cells was slightly, but significantly lower in Casz1 knockout mice compared to WT mice (Figures  D,E, top panel; Figure S4A in Supplementary Material). We then characterized the CD4  cells by assessing the frequency of CD62L  na\u00efve, CD44 high effector/memory, and CD25 Foxp3  T  in 6- to 12-week-old mice. CD4  T cells from Casz1 knockout mice harbored slightly lower frequency of CD62L  na\u00efve cells and moderately higher frequencies of CD44  cells (Figure  E, second and third panels). However, the frequency of T  was comparable to WT mice (Figure  E, bottom panel), and the phenotype of Casz1 knockout mice was normal. These results suggested that whereas CD4  T cell-specific Casz1 deletion slightly reduces CD4  T cell frequencies, CD4  cell phenotype is normal in the periphery. However, we found that the frequency of CD44  IL-17A  natural memory Th17\u2009cells was significantly lower in mucosal tissues of Casz1 knockout mice in   ex vivo   (Figure S4B in Supplementary Material, Y axis; Figure S4C in Supplementary Material) ( ). We also observed a small, but reproducible increase in CD44  Foxp3  T  cells ( ,  ) in gut and oral tissues of Casz1 knockout mice in   ex vivo   (Figures S4B, X axis, Figure S4C in Supplementary Material). These results prompted us to focus on Casz1-mediated effects on Th differentiation and inflammation   in vivo  , rather than focusing on reduced CD4 cell frequencies in subsequent experiments. \n  \nCasz1 mRNA expression in CD4  T lymphocytes. RNA was isolated from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorted CD4 CD25 GFP CD44  (Na\u00efve) cells, CD4 CD25 GFP  (regulatory T cells, T ), CD4 CD44  (effector/memory) cells pooled from spleen (SPLN) and lymph nodes (LN) of six Foxp3  mice and used for Quantitative PCR   (A)   Na\u00efve cells were stimulated with 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml of plate-bound \u03b1-CD3 and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml of soluble \u03b1-CD28 antibodies for 3\u2009days (activated)   (A)  , or for indicated times [  (B)  , upper panel]. Human FACS sorted CD4 CD25  CD44  CD45RA na\u00efve cells were activated for indicated times [  (B)  , lower panel]. Phenotype of CD4 conditional Casz1 knockout mice   (C\u2013E)  .   (C)   Na\u00efve CD4  cells from WT (CD4-cre Casz1 ) (blue), or knockout (CD4-cre Casz1 ) (red) mice were stimulated for indicated times.   (D)   Single cell suspensions from thymus, SPLN, and LN from WT (blue) or knockout (red) mice   (D)  , or SPLN and LN pooled   (E)  , were used for flow cytometry staining in   ex vivo   [Gated on CD4  T cells in second\u2013fourth panels in   (E)  ]. Two-way ANOVA multiple comparison tests   (A,B)  , Student\u2019s   t  -tests   (C)  , Two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons test   (D)   were performed to determine the significance. Data from one of three independent experiments are shown. \n  \n\n### Casz1 Controls Th Lineage Differentiation Depending on the Cytokine Milieu \n  \nFirst, we sought to determine whether Casz1 affects CD4  T cell activation and proliferation   in vitro  . We sorted CD4 CD44 CD25  na\u00efve cells from WT and Casz1 knockout mice and stimulated them using 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml of plate-bound \u03b1-CD3 and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml of soluble \u03b1-CD28 antibodies in the absence of polarization conditions, and assessed their proliferation and activation on d4 after stimulation. CFSE dilution assay revealed that proliferation of Casz1 knockout cells was comparable to WT cells (Figure  A, top panel). Also, the expression of activation markers, such as CD25, CD44, and IL-2, as well as Foxp3 were comparable between CD4  T cells from these mice at various time points after stimulation (Figure  A, middle and bottom panels; Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). However, we found that IFN-\u03b3 secretion was 15\u201320% higher in Casz1 knockout CD4  T cells, while TNF-\u03b1 expression did not show significant changes, compared to WT CD4  T cells, as assessed by intracellular staining on d4 after stimulation (Figures  B,C). Because the Casz1 deficient CD4  T cells defaulted to IFN-\u03b3 producing Th1 subset compared to WT cells, we hypothesized that Casz1 may control Th cell specification events. Since, cytokine concentrations dictate the Th differentiation into different subsets, we activated na\u00efve cells with different concentrations of Th specification cytokines, such as IL-12 (Th1), IL-6 (Th17), and TGF-\u03b2 (iT ), mimicking suboptimal Th polarization conditions. Depending on the concentration of IL-12 and TGF-\u03b2, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 and Foxp3 expressing cells was 7\u201311% higher in Casz1 deficient cultures compared to WT cultures (Figures  D,E). However, at all concentrations of IL-6 in partial Th17 polarization milieu, IL-17A production was reduced by up to fourfold in Casz1 deficient cultures than WT cultures (Figures  D,E). Taken together, these data indicate that while Casz1 inhibits IFN-\u03b3 and Foxp3 expression depending on the cytokine milieu, it potently promotes the expression of IL-17A, a key component of the Th17 phenotype. \n  \nCasz1 controls T helper lineage differentiation depending on the cytokine milieu.   (A\u2013C)   Na\u00efve CD4  cells isolated from WT (left) or knockout (right) mice were stimulated with 1\u2009\u00b5g/ml of plate-bound \u03b1-CD3 and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml of soluble \u03b1-CD28 antibodies for 4\u2009days   (A,B)   or for indicated times and subjected to flow cytometry. The percentage of divided cells is indicated as % Prol. in   (A)  .   (C)   Averages from 3 independent experiments are plotted. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test.   (D,E)   Cells were stimulated as in   (A)  , in the presence of indicated cytokines for 4\u2009days before the intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Data represent one of the five independent experiments showing similar results. Gates were drawn using unstain or isotype controls. \n  \n\n### Casz1 Is a Critical Component of Th17 Lineage Differentiation \n  \nBecause Casz1 controls genes instructing Th1/Th17 specification program in partial polarization conditions, we next sought to investigate the role of Casz1 in synchronized Th cells that are activated under complete polarization conditions (see  ) (Figure S6 in Supplementary Material). We activated the na\u00efve cells under Th1 (IL-12, \u03b1-IL-4, and IL-2), Th2 (\u03b1-IL-12, IL-4, and IL-2), iT  (TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2), and Th17 (\u03b1-IFN-\u03b3, \u03b1-IL-4, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2) polarization conditions in the presence of \u03b1-CD3, \u03b1-CD28, and APC. After a 5-day stimulation, there were no differences in proliferation between WT and Casz1 knockout in any of the Th cell-type cultures, as assessed by CFSE dilution (Figure  A, X axis). Consistent with the results from partial polarization conditions, the proportion of IFN-\u03b3 producers was 16% higher in Casz1 knockout Th1 cultures than Casz1 WT Th1\u2009cells under complete Th1 polarization conditions (Figure  A, top panel). We also found a higher geometric mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\u03b3 staining in Casz1 knockout cultures (Figure  A, top panel). However, there were no differences between Casz1 knockout cultures and WT cells in IL-4 and Foxp3 expression in Th2 and iT  conditions, respectively (Figure  A, second and third panels). However, under Th17 conditions, IL-17A production was significantly and consistently lower in Casz1 deficient cultures compared to WT controls at all time-points assessed after stimulation (Figure  A, bottom panel, Figure  B, Y-axis, Figure  C). No significant differences could be detected in Foxp3 expression between WT and knockout cells in Th17 cultures (Figure  B, X-axis). ELISA also showed that the supernatant from Casz1 deficient cultures had 1.5- to 2-fold lower IL-17A protein levels than WT controls (Figure  D). These striking differences in Th17 phenotype between WT and Casz1 knockout T cells led us to examine polarized Th17\u2009cells in more detail. qRT-PCR confirmed the absence of   Casz1   mRNA and ~two to threefold decrease in   Rorc   and   Il17A   mRNA levels in Casz1 deficient T cells as compared to WT cells isolated from the cultures at various time-points (Figure  E). Most of the IL-17A  cells co-expressed IL-17F, and the frequency of IL-17A IL-17F  double producers was also diminished by 40% in Casz1 deficient cells (Figure S7 in Supplementary Material). Also, the levels of other Th17-associated proteins, such as IL-22, ROR-\u03b3t, and phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT-3) were much lower in Casz1 deficient cells than WT Th17\u2009cells (Figure  F). However, Casz1 deficient cells did not show a major defect in CD25 upregulation, or default to IFN-\u03b3 producing Th1 lineage or iT  lineage under the influence of strong Th17 differentiation signals   in vitro   (Figure  B, X-axis; Figure S8 in Supplementary Material). We found similar results when we compared Casz1 Ht and Casz1 deficient Th17\u2009cells, Ht and WT mice showed similar phenotype (see Figure  ). Taken together, while Casz1 is not essential for activation and proliferation of CD4  T cells, it appears to be required for Th17 differentiation. \n  \nCasz1 promotes IL-17A expression in Th17 cultures.   (A)   Casz1 WT or Casz1 knockout na\u00efve CD4  T cells were cultured under Th1 (top), Th2 (second panel), iT  (third panel), or Th17 (bottom panel) conditions for 5\u2009days. Th1, Th2, Th17\u2009cells were stimulated with antigen presenting cells (APC), and iT  without APC (Figure S6 in Supplementary Material). Intracellular cytokine staining was performed in PMA/ionomycin re-stimulated cells. Data from flow cytometric analyses (gated on CD4  cells) showing the proliferation (carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester, X axis), percentage of IFN-\u03b3 (top), IL-4 (second panel), Foxp3 (third panel), and IL-17A (bottom panel) positive cells (Y-axis). Gates were drawn based on unstained and un-stimulated controls (not shown). G.M of IFN-\u03b3 staining in Th1\u2009cells (top panel) is indicated at the bottom of the plots.   (B)   Casz1 WT or Casz1 knockout na\u00efve CD4  cells were stimulated under Th17 skewing conditions in the presence of APC for indicated days before flow cytometry.   (C)   Casz1 WT (blue) or Casz1 knockout (red) na\u00efve CD4  cells were stimulated under Th17 conditions as in (  B  ) in five independent experiments, and the frequency of IL-17A  cells was determined by flow cytometry on day 4 (*  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 was determined by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test).   (D)   Supernatants were collected for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at indicated time-points.   (E)   Casz1 WT (blue) or Casz1 knockout (red) na\u00efve CD4  cells were stimulated under Th17 conditions for indicated time-points as in   (B)  , and APCs were removed by MACS before determining the mRNA levels of Casz1 (top), RAR-related orphan receptor-\u03b3t (middle), and IL-17A (bottom) in CD4  T cells by qPCR.   (F)   Casz1 WT (blue) or Casz1 knockout (red) cells were stimulated as in   (B)   for 3\u2009days and were stained for indicated proteins (gated on CD4  cells). For phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT3) and pSTAT5 staining, cells were washed and re-stimulated with IL-6 or IL-2, respectively for 30\u2009min before fixation. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments (*  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test or Mann\u2013Whitney test). Gates were drawn using unstain or isotype controls. \n    \nLoss of Casz1 ameliorates Th17 inflammation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)   in vivo  .   (A)   EAE was induced in 8- to 10-week-old Casz1 WT (blue;   n  \u2009=\u20097) or Casz1 knockout (red;   n  \u2009=\u20096) mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide. Some Casz1  WT control mice were left untreated (white;   n  \u2009=\u20096; No EAE). EAE scores were recorded in masked fashion. Mean scores\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are plotted. ***  P  \u2009=\u20090.002 was determined by two-way ANOVA   t  -test.   (B)   On day 10 after EAE induction, pooled axillary/inguinal lymph nodes (LN), or spinal cords (SC) were harvested for re-stimulation with MOG peptide and intracellular staining of Foxp3 (X axis) and IL-17A (Y axis)   (B)  , or IFN- \u03b3 (X axis) and IL-17A (Y axis)   (C)   (Gated on CD4  cells).   (D\u2013I)   The frequencies and cell counts of cytokine and Foxp3 expressing cells in LN or SC are plotted (gated on CD4  cells). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of each group is shown. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s   post hoc   analyses were performed to determine significance. These data represent three independent experiments. Gates were drawn using unstain or isotype controls. \n  \n\n### Casz1 Deficiency Lowers EAE Severity Correlating to IL-17A Reduction \n  \nThe above results indicated that Casz1 might control inflammation in a Th17-dependent EAE disease model, which mimics the demyelinating disease pathology in multiple sclerosis. To determine the function of Casz1 in EAE progression, we induced the disease in WT (  n  \u2009=\u20095) and Casz1 knockout mice (  n  \u2009=\u20096) ( ). Casz1 knockout mice exhibited significantly attenuated disease severity, with lower EAE scores compared to WT mice (Figure  A). On days 10 or 15 after EAE induction, we isolated single cell suspensions of CD4  cells from axillary and inguinal LN and spinal cords (SC) to assess cytokine production. Flow cytometry analyses revealed that CD4  T cells in Casz1 knockout mice contained significantly lower IL-17A producing T cells compared to WT mice (Figures  A,C, Y-axes, Figure  D). However, the overall CD4  T cell numbers, the expression of GMCSF and CCR6 in CD4  T cells were unchanged   in vivo   (data not shown). Consistent with our   in vitro   observations in partially polarized cultures (Figures  D,E), the decrease in IL-17A producing cells coincided with the increase in Foxp3  cells, as well as IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells in Casz1 knockout mice (Figures  B,C, X-axes, Figures  E,F). However, the frequency of IL-17A  IFN-\u03b3  cytokine producers was substantially lower in Casz1 knockout than WT mice (Figure  G). These results show that Casz1 deficiency in T cell lineage results in a diminished iTh17 response and a failure to develop EAE. \n\n\n### Casz1 Deficient Mice Display Impaired Recall Response to   Candida albicans   Challenge, Coinciding with Lower IL-17A Production in CD4  T Cells   In Vivo  \n  \nWe next examined the role of Casz1 during oral   Candida   infection, a model in which IL-17A and Th17\u2009cells are required for anti-fungal defense in the host ( ,  ). Fungal lesions and inflammation in the tongue, decreased food intake, body weight loss, and the eventual moribund state are characteristics of susceptibility of the mice to oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) infection. As Casz1  Ht and WT mice showed similar phenotype in our   in vitro   experiments, we used Ht mice as controls in this experiment (see above, and Figure  ). We orally infected CD4-cre Casz1  Ht control (  n  \u2009=\u20095) and Casz1 knockout (  n  \u2009=\u20095) mice with   Candida   or PBS sham control as described previously ( ). One group of mice also received cortisone as an immunosuppressant (  n  \u2009=\u20093). We quantified IL-17A cytokine levels in pooled axillary and cervical draining LN and tongues from the 3 or 5-day infected mice (Figure  A). Casz1 knockout mice exhibited a significantly lower frequency of IL-17A producers and Foxp3  cells among CD4  cells, but no significant difference in the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells, compared to controls (Figure  A). Interestingly, there was a slight, but significant delay in recovery from infection-dependent body weight loss in Casz1 knockout mice, albeit both the control and Casz1 knockout groups eventually recovered (Figure  B). As expected, cortisone group mice progressively lost weight. There were no significant differences in fungal burden between the control and knockout groups, when assessed on day 7 after infection (Figure S9A in Supplementary Material). Because Th17\u2009cells are predominantly involved in recall responses during OPC ( ), we next investigated the role of Casz1 during recall responses to   Candida  . Analysis of SPLN, LN, and tongue infiltrates at 2\u2009days after secondary infection revealed that the frequency of IL17A producing CD4  T cells was significantly reduced in Casz1 knockout mice (Figures  C,D). Also, absence of Casz1 caused a significant diminution in IFN-\u03b3 IL-17A  iTh17\u2009cells (Th1*) in draining LN and tongue during secondary infection (Figure  C). While the frequency of Foxp3  T  cells decreased in Casz1 knockout groups during primary infection, there was no significant difference in Foxp3 expression between groups during secondary infection (Figure  A; Figure S9B in Supplementary Material, X-axis). Strikingly, coinciding with a lower Th17 recall response in Casz1 deficient group, we observed a pronounced body weight loss (Figure  E), abundance of fungal hyphae in the tongue (Figure  F; Figure S9C in Supplementary Material, left) and heightened tongue inflammation indicated by increased immune cell infiltration (Figure S9C in Supplementary Material, right). \n  \nLoss of Casz1 impairs IL-17A production and Th17 recall responses during   Candida   infection in mice.   (A)   8- to 10-week-old CD4-cre Casz1  (  n  \u2009=\u20095) or CD4-cre Casz1  (  n  \u2009=\u20095) were infected with   Candida   as described in Methods. Some control mice received PBS (Sham;   n  \u2009=\u20095) or immunosuppressed with Cortisone injection (Cort;   n  \u2009=\u20093). Pooled axillary and cervical draining lymph nodes (LN) and the tongues were harvested and restimulated with PMA/Ionomycin on day 3 after primary infection for IFN-\u03b3 (X-axis) and IL-17A (Y-axis) staining (gated on CD4  cells). Data on day 5 showed similar results (not shown).   (B)   Percent weight change on indicated days after primary infection.   (C,D)   Mice were infected as in   (A)  , and re-infected on d21 after primary infection. Two days after reinfection, spleen (SPLN), draining LN, and tongues were processed for flow cytometry.   (E)   Percent weight change on indicated days after re-infection.   (F)   On day 5 after reinfection, histology sections of the tongue were stained with periodic acid schiffs to detect the fungus. Microscopic images of the slides that were viewed at 200\u00d7 magnification, with insets showing further magnification [arrows show   Candida   (pink)]. At least five independent experiments, comparing heterozygous with knockout animals, as well as WT with knockout animals showed similar results. Two-way ANOVA test was performed to determine the significance. Gates were drawn using unstain or isotype controls. \n  \n\n### Casz1 Favors Th17 Specification Program \n  \nTo assess whether Casz1 regulates the broad Th program, we performed transcriptome analysis using high-throughput RNA-seq of the WT and Casz1 deficient CD4  T cells stimulated under partial Th17 polarization conditions,   i.e  ., without blocking IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 (see Figure S6 in Supplementary Material). We added Th17 cytokines, such as IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2, but did not block IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, such that we can obtain an impartial assessment of the effect of Casz1 on the global Th differentiation program while focusing on Th17 program. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 194 genes including Casz1, IL-17A, and IL-22 were upregulated, while 156 genes were downregulated in WT cells compared to Casz1 deficient CD4  T cells (Figure  A). Global pathway analysis identified alterations in immune cell signaling, inflammatory diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, humoral, and cell-mediated responses (Figure S10A in Supplementary Material). Strikingly, loss of Casz1 led to significant decreases in key Th17 specification genes ( ) that included   Rora, Ahr, Runx1, Irf4, Fosl2, Stat3, Ccr6, Il23r, Il1r, Il17a, Il17f, Il22, and Il21   (Figure  B). We also found that Casz1 restrains the expression of some of the genes that instruct Th1 differentiation program, namely   Tbx1, Irf1, Stat1, Stat4, and Ifng   (Figure  C). GSEA ( ) indicated a significant negative enrichment of literature-curated Th17 signature genes in Casz1 deficient cells (20 of 31 genes) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, FDR   q  \u2009<\u20090.001) (Figure  D; Figure S10B in Supplementary Material). Casz1 also restricts the expression of some of the genes driving Th1 lineage commitment. These data are consistent with a key role for Casz1 as a regulator of Th plasticity program and necessary for robust Th17 differentiation. \n  \nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis shows that Casz1 favors Th17 specification program. Volcano plot [  (A)  , top], Scatter plot [  (A)  , bottom], and heat maps of genes encoding literature curated Th17 signature proteins   (B)   and Th1 regulatory proteins   (C)  , derived from RNA-seq analysis comparing partially polarized CD4-cre Casz1  Th17\u2009cells and CD4-cre Casz1  Th17\u2009cells. Th17 and Th1 signature genes were defined based on the published literature. In   (B,C)  , the upper dendrograms illustrate the results of unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all six samples based on the expression of these Th17 signature genes.   (D)   Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the whole gene list generated from RNA-seq. This whole gene list was pre-ranked based on   T  -Score, then uploaded to GSEA software. Abbreviations:   Nes  , normalized enrichment score;   Nom  , nominal;   FDR  , false discovery rate. Th17 signature gene list that was used for GSEA is depicted in Figure S10B in Supplementary Material. Data are representative of three independent biological replicates from cells derived from three independent experiments. \n  \n\n### Casz1 Affects the Chromatin State of Th17 Lineage Genes \n  \nNext, we sought to determine the mechanism underlying Casz1-mediated control of Th differentiation program focusing on Th17 signature genes. Casz1 has been shown to interact with histones and recruit nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex, and Polycomb complex histone methytransferase subunits EZH2 to regulate gene transcription in HEK293T and neuroblastoma cells ( ). Also, Casz1 is a zinc-finger protein similar to Ikaros ( ), a protein that controls Th differentiation genes through epigenetic modifications ( \u2013 ). Casz1 is present in an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor pathway in which Ikaros regulates Casz1 expression in neural progenitors ( ). While diminution of ROR-\u03b3t and activated STAT-3 may provide some mechanistic insight into reduced IL-17A production in Casz1 deficient Th17\u2009cells, we explored whether Casz1 also mediates some of its effects through epigenetic mechanisms. We compared WT and Casz1 deficient CD4  T cells for chromatin modifications at the promoters and the regulatory regions of the key Th17 genes by ChIP assay. We first evaluated repressive (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) histone modifications at several sites, including the promoter and CNS-2 regions of the   Il17a   gene, +2.7, and +5.0 sites of the   Rorc   gene, and proximal promoter regions of   Ahr   and   Runx1   genes, which are known to contain chromatin modifications associated with Th17 commitment ( ,  ). We observed increased amounts of H3K27me3 modifications at   Il17a   promoter and   Rorc   loci in Casz1 deficient na\u00efve cells compared to WT controls (Figure  A). While H3K9me3 repressive modifications were also present at higher levels at   Rorc   locus, H4K12Ac permissive modifications were lower in non-polarized na\u00efve Casz1 deficient cells compared to WT controls (Figure  A). However, as expected, cells activated under Th17 polarizing conditions exhibited much lower repressive modifications than na\u00efve cells. Such modifications were still higher in Casz1 deficient cells compared to WT cells, in   IL17a CNS2B   and   Ahr   loci (Figure  B). Strikingly, in activated Th17\u2009cells, permissive histone marks (H3K4me3, H4K12Ac) increased, but were detected at much lower levels on all the loci examined in Casz1 knockout Th17\u2009cells (Figure  B). To validate the alterations in histone methylation and acetylation at the Th17 signature gene loci contribute to decreased IL-17A production in Casz1 deficient cells, we treated Th17 cultures with DNA methyl-transferase EZH2 inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and determined the IL-17A production. We stimulated the Ht (CD4-cre Casz1 ) and Casz1 deficient na\u00efve cells under Th17 conditions in the presence of GSKS343 (EZH2 inhibitor) and a SCFA HDAC inhibitor butyrate. GSKS343 and SCFA partially blocked the activation of CD4  T cells, therefore, we gated on CD44  activated cells to determine the intracellular IL-17A expression. GSKS343 and SCFA alone moderately, but significantly increased IL-17A production in Casz1 deficient cells. However, combinations of these inhibitors restored the IL-17A production of Casz1 deficient cells comparable to Ht control levels (Figure  C). Of note, such treatment of Casz1 deficient cells also normalized their IL-17A and ROR-\u03b3t mRNA expression to control levels (Figure  D). Collectively, the increase in repressive marks and reduction in activating histone marks in Casz1 deficient cells indicate that Casz1 influences the chromatin landscape of Th17\u2009cell lineage-determining genes. These results also established a key requirement of the Casz1-dependent histone modifications in genes encoding several markers of Th17 differentiation in instructing the Th17 program. \n  \nCasz1 promotes the expression of Th17 genes by affecting chromatin modifications in Th17 lineage genes. Casz1 WT (blue) or Casz1 knockout (red) na\u00efve cells were fixed   (A)  , or stimulated as in Figure  B for 4\u20135\u2009days before fixation   (B)  , for chromatin immunoprecipitation using \u03b1-H3K9me3, \u03b1-H3K27me3, \u03b1-H3K4me3, \u03b1-H4K12Ac, or control IgG antibodies and qPCR primer pairs for the indicated genes. Casz1 heterozygous (blue) or Casz1 knockout (red) na\u00efve CD4  cells were stimulated under Th17 conditions as in Figure  B for 4\u2009days in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or the indicated inhibitors. The frequency of IL-17A  cells was determined by flow cytometry (gated on CD4 CD44  cells)   (C)   Antigen presenting cells were removed by MACS purification of CD4  T cells before determining the mRNA levels of IL-17A (left) and RAR-related orphan receptor-\u03b3t (right) in CD4  T cells by qPCR   (D)  . Results represent 3 independent experiments. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, as determined by unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we have identified that Casz1 is expressed in CD4  T lymphocytes and is essential for determining Th1/Th17 balance, depending on the context. By employing CD4-conditional Casz1 knockout mice and global transcriptome analyses of CD4  T cells, we have demonstrated that Casz1 plays a crucial role in Th plasticity, mainly instructing Th17 lineage differentiation program. The physiological requirement of Casz1 in Th17\u2009cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis was demonstrated by   in vivo   experiments showing that Casz1 deficiency leads to amelioration of EAE disease and a compromised recall immunity of the host toward OPC infection (Figures   and  ). On one hand, Casz1 plays a detrimental role by promoting iTh17\u2009cell induction among CNS infiltrating cells and exacerbates the initiation and progression of EAE disease. It should be noted that Casz1 is required for EAE disease despite its ability to restrain IFN-\u03b3   in vivo   (Figures  B,C). On the other hand, Casz1 coordinates a protective Th17 recall responses without altering the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-single producers during a mucosal infection. However, in the both the models, absence of Casz1 causes a significant diminution in IFN-\u03b3 IL-17A  iTh17 (Th1*) cells in tissues, correlating to reduced inflammation, and recall responses   in vivo  . Whether Th17 plasticity causes Th1* cell generation in tissues and Casz1 controls this process remains to be studied. Although Casz1 reduces Foxp3 expression when activated with low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2   in vitro   (Figure  B), there were no differences observed between WT and knockout cells under complete iT  polarization conditions   in vitro   or   in vivo   (Figure  A). This would not be surprising considering the reciprocal relationship between Th17 and T  lineages. Moreover, the frequency of CD25 Foxp3  cells was consistently higher in the absence of Casz1   in vivo  , implying that Casz1 plays a role in regulating these cells. Although CD25 Foxp3  cells are implicated in T  plasticity, the role of Casz1 in regulation of this population remains unclear. These data highlight the ability of Casz1 to contextually program Th lineage differentiation, depending on the cytokine and immunological location   in vivo   (Figures   and  ). When CD4  T cells are activated under Th17 inducing conditions, loss of Casz1 results in dramatic reduction of other Th17 hallmark effector molecules and lineage-determining transcription factors, including IL-17F, IL-21, FosL2, Ikaros, Ahr, Runx1, Rorc, IL1R1, and IL-23R (Figure  B). Under Th17 and Th1 polarization conditions   in vitro  , Casz1 restricts IFN-\u03b3 production (from IFN-\u03b3-single producers) (Figures  B\u2013D and  A), as in the EAE model. Consistently, our transcriptome analyses also show that many of the Th1 signature genes are significantly up-regulated in Casz1 deficient CD4  T cells, even under suboptimal Th17 milieu   in vitro   (Figure  C). Taken together, these results show that while Casz1 favors Th17 lineage   in vitro   and   in vivo  , it may also play a negative regulatory role in Th1 and iT  lineage commitment depending on the cytokine milieu. The mechanisms underlying Casz1-mediated restriction of T  and Th1 genes, and induction of iTh17\u2009cells or Th1* cells (IFN\u03b3 IL-17A ) in tissues remain to be investigated in the future. Consistent with the role of Casz1 in promoting Th17\u2009cells in mucosal tissues, the frequency of memory Th17\u2009cells is also lower in mucosal tissues of Casz1 knockout mice   ex vivo   (Figure S4B in Supplementary Material, Y axis). These results not only corroborate our results demonstrating the positive regulatory role of Casz1 in Th17 differentiation, but also highlight the possibility that Casz1 may be involved in the generation of memory Th17\u2009cells   in vivo   ( ), as well as IFN\u03b3 IL-17A  (Th1*) cells during memory Th17 responses, which will be studied in the future. Because we have deleted Casz1 in CD4  compartment, some of the effects may arguably be attributed to CD4  macrophages   in vivo  .   In vitro   experiments using purified CD4  T cells that showed Th program alterations in Casz1 knockout cells demonstrates that the observed effects are predominantly driven by CD4  T cell defects   in vivo  . Whether the loss of Casz1 additionally affects natural killer T cells and innate lymphoid cells remains to be investigated in the future. Mechanistically, our data show that Casz1 promotes the Th17 program at least in part by epigenetic regulation of several of the Th17 signature genes. Analysis of histone modification patterns reveals that Casz1 affects chromatin modification in Th17 genes, both in peripheral na\u00efve CD4  cells and in TCR stimulated Th17\u2009cells. On one hand, Casz1 maintains Th17 gene expression potential by inhibiting the attainment of H3K27me3-dependent repressive configuration at the   Il17a   and   Rorc   elements, and decreases H3K9me3 repressive marks at   Rorc   promoter in na\u00efve CD4  T cells (Figure  A). On the other hand in activated Th17\u2009cells, activation of TCR, IL-6, and TGF-\u03b21 receptor signals overcomes the differences in H3K27me3-dependent repressive states between WT and Casz1 deficient cells. However, in activated Th17\u2009cells, Casz1 autonomously promotes the acquisition of permissive H3K4me3 as well as H3K12Ac modifications in key Th17 genes (Figure  B). Consistent with these results we found that inhibition of H3K27 tri-methylation by EZH2 inhibition, only partially reversed the defect in IL-17A production by Casz1 deficient cells activated under Th17 conditions. Altering methylation and acetylation of histone modifications alone using chemical inhibitors does not completely restore Th17 defects in Casz1 knockout cells (Figures  C,D), suggesting additional functions of Casz1 in Th cell differentiation. Recently, Casz1 has been shown to interact with T-box transcription factor ( ). Whether such direct interactions between Casz1 and other transcription factors regulate T cell differentiation remains to be seen. \n\nWe did not examine whether Casz1 binds directly at any of the Th17 lineage genes because a Casz1 antibody that can be employed for CHIP purification is currently not available. Taken together, we have shown that while Casz1 can modulate Th1 and T  cell differentiation, only in certain cytokine contexts   in vivo  , it plays a central role in integrating cytokine cues and promoting Th17 differentiation program   in vitro   and   in vivo  . Control of Th17 program by Casz1, partially requires its ability to induce epigenetic changes in iTh17 genes. Thus, Casz1 signaling pathway represents an additional pharmacologically tractable signaling axis for modulating Th17 development and targeting a variety of immunodeficiency and inflammatory disorders. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nExperiments were performed at Case Western Reserve University under approved protocols in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\u2019s guidelines.

Progress in understanding the biology\u00a0of mosquitoes and developing the tools to fight them has been slowed by the lack of a high-quality genome assembly. Here we combine diverse technologies to produce the markedly improved, fully re-annotated AaegL5 genome assembly, and demonstrate how it accelerates mosquito science. We anchored physical and cytogenetic maps, doubled the number of known chemosensory ionotropic receptors that guide mosquitoes to human hosts and egg-laying sites, provided further insight into the size and composition of the sex-determining M locus, and revealed copy-number variation among glutathione   S  -transferase genes that are important for insecticide resistance. Using high-resolution quantitative trait locus and population genomic analyses, we mapped new candidates for dengue vector competence and insecticide resistance. AaegL5 will catalyse new biological insights and intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease vector. \n  \nAn improved, fully re-annotated   Aedes aegypti   genome assembly (AaegL5) provides insights into the sex-determining M locus, chemosensory systems that help mosquitoes to hunt humans and loci involved in insecticide resistance and will help to generate intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease vector. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Main \n  \nAn accurate and complete genome assembly is required to understand the unique aspects of mosquito biology and to develop control strategies to reduce their capacity to spread pathogens . The   Ae. aegypti   genome is large (approximately 1.25 Gb) and highly repetitive, and a 2007 genome project (AaegL3)  was unable to produce a contiguous genome fully anchored to a physical chromosome map  (Fig.\u00a0 ). A more recent assembly, AaegL4 , produced chromosome-length scaffolds that made it possible to detect larger-scale syntenic genomic regions in other species but suffered from short contigs (contig N50, 84 kb, meaning that half of the assembly is found on contigs >84 kb) and a correspondingly large number of gaps (31,018; Fig.\u00a0 ). Taking advantage of rapid advances in sequencing and assembly technology in the last decade, we used long-read Pacific Biosciences sequencing and Hi-C (a high-throughput sequencing method based on chromosome conformation capture) scaffolding to produce a new reference genome (AaegL5) that is highly contiguous, with a decrease of 93% in the number of contigs, and anchored end-to-end to the three   Ae. aegypti   chromosomes (Fig.\u00a0  and Extended Data Figs.\u00a0 ,  ). Using optical mapping and linked-read sequencing, we validated the local structure and predicted structural variants between haplotypes. We generated an improved gene set annotation (AaegL5.0), as assessed by a mean increase in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) read alignment of 12%, connections between many gene models that were previously split across multiple contigs, and a roughly twofold increase in the enrichment of assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) alignments near predicted transcription start sites. We demonstrate the utility of AaegL5 and the AaegL5.0 annotation by investigating a number of scientific questions that could not be addressed with the previous genome annotations.

Using flow cytometry, we estimated that the genome size of LVP_AGWG is approximately 1.22 Gb (Fig.\u00a0  and Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). To generate our primary assembly, we produced 166 Gb of Pacific Biosciences data (around 130\u00d7 coverage for a 1.28-Gb genome) and assembled the genome using FALCON-Unzip . This resulted in a total assembly length of 2.05 Gb (contig N50, 0.96 Mb; and NG50, 1.92 Mb, meaning half of the expected genome size found on contigs >1.92 Mb). FALCON-Unzip annotated the resulting contigs as either primary (3,967 contigs; N50, 1.30 Mb; NG50, 1.91 Mb) or haplotigs (3,823 contigs; N50, 193 kb), representing alternative haplotypes present in the approximately 80 male siblings pooled for sequencing (Table\u00a0  and Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). The primary assembly was longer than expected for a haploid   Ae. aegypti   genome, as predicted by flow cytometry and prior assemblies, which was consistent with remaining alternative haplotypes that were too divergent to be automatically identified as primary and associated alternative haplotig pairs.   \nComparison of assembly statistics \n  \nN/A, not applicable. \n\nScaffold N50 is the length of chromosome 3. \n  \n\nTo generate a linear chromosome-scale reference genome assembly, we combined the primary contigs and haplotigs that were generated by FALCON-Unzip to create an assembly comprising 7,790 contigs. We used Hi-C to order and orient these contigs, correct misjoined sections and merge overlaps (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). We set aside 359 contigs that were shorter than 20 kb and used the Hi-C data to identify 258 misjoined sections, resulting in 8,306 ordered and oriented contigs. This procedure revealed extensive sequence overlap among the contigs, consistent with the assembly of numerous alternative haplotypes. We developed a procedure to merge these alternative haplotypes, removing 5,440 gaps and boosting the contiguity (N50, 5.0 Mb; NG50, 4.6 Mb). This procedure placed 94% of sequenced (non-duplicated) bases onto three chromosome-length scaffolds that correspond to the three   Ae. aegypti   chromosomes. After scaffolding, we performed gap-filling and polishing using Pacific Biosciences reads. This removed 270 gaps and further increased the contiguity (N50, 11.8 Mb; NG50, 11.8 Mb), resulting in a final 1.279-Gb AaegL5 assembly and a complete mitochondrial genome (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). We used Hi-C contact maps to estimate the position of the centromere with a resolution of around 5 Mb: chromosome 1, approximately 150\u2013154 Mb; chromosome 2, around 227\u2013232 Mb, chromosome 3, around 196\u2013201 Mb. There are 229 remaining gaps in the primary assembly, including 173 on the three primary chromosomal scaffolds (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Analysis of near-universal single-copy orthologues using BUSCO  revealed a slight increase in complete single-copy orthologues and a reduction in fragmented and missing genes compared to previous assemblies (see\u00a0  and  ). AaegL5 is markedly more contiguous than AaegL3 and AaegL4 assemblies  (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). Using the TEfam, Repbase and de novo identified repeat databases, we found that 65% of AaegL5 was composed of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ,  ). \n\nComplete and correct gene models are essential for studying all aspects of mosquito biology. We used the NCBI RefSeq annotation pipeline to produce annotation version 101 (AaegL5.0; Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ) followed by manual curation of key gene families. AaegL5.0 formed the basis for a comprehensive quantification of transcript abundance in 253 sex-, tissue- and developmental stage-specific RNA-seq libraries (Supplementary Data\u00a0 \u2013 ). The AaegL5.0 gene set is considerably more complete and correct than previous versions. Many more genes have high protein coverage when compared to   Drosophila melanogaster   orthologues (915 more genes with >80% coverage, a 12.5% increase over AaegL3.4; Fig.\u00a0 ) and >12% more RNA-seq reads map to the AaegL5.0 gene set annotation than AaegL3.4 (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). In addition, 1,463 genes that were previously annotated separately as paralogues were collapsed into single gene models and 481 previously fragmented gene models were completed (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ,  ). For example,   sex peptide receptor   is represented by a six-exon gene model in AaegL5.0 compared to two partial gene fragments on separate scaffolds in AaegL3.4 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). Genome-wide, we mapped a 1.8-fold higher number of ATAC-seq reads, known to co-localize with promoters and other   cis  -regulatory elements , to predicted transcription start sites in AaegL5.0 compared to AaegL3.4, consistent with more complete gene models in AaegL5.0 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWe next validated the base-level and structural accuracy of the AaegL5 assembly. We estimate the lower bound of base-level accuracy of the assembly to have a quality value of 34.75 (meaning that 99.9665% of bases are correct, see\u00a0  and  ). To develop a fine-scale physical genome map based on AaegL5, we compared the assembly coordinates of 500 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing   Ae. aegypti   genomic DNA with physical mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). After removing repetitive BAC-end sequences and those with ambiguous FISH signals, 377 out of 387 (97.4%) of probes showed concordance between physical mapping and BAC-end alignment. The 10 remaining discordant signals were not supported by Bionano or 10X analysis, and therefore probably do not reflect misassemblies in AaegL5. The genome coverage of this physical map is 93.5%, compared to 45% of AaegL3 , and is one of the most complete genome maps across mosquito species . \n\n\n## Curation of multi-gene families \n  \nLarge multi-gene families are very difficult to assemble and correctly annotate, because recently duplicated genes typically share high sequence similarities or can be misclassified as alleles of a single gene. We curated genes in large multi-gene families that encode proteases, G\u00a0protein-coupled receptors, and chemosensory receptors using the improved AaegL5 genome and AaegL5.0 annotation. Serine proteases mediate immune responses  and metalloproteases have been linked to vector competence and mosquito\u2013  Plasmodium   interactions . Gene models for over 50% of the 404 annotated serine proteases and metalloproteases in AaegL3.4 were improved in AaegL5.0, and we found 49 previously unannotated protease genes (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). G\u00a0protein-coupled receptors are membrane proteins that respond to diverse external and internal sensory stimuli. We provide major corrections to gene models that encode 10 visual opsins and 17 dopamine and serotonin receptors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 \u2013 ). Three large\u00a0multi-gene\u00a0families of insect chemosensory receptors are ligand-gated ion channels: odorant receptors (  OR   gene family), gustatory receptors (  GR   gene family) and ionotropic receptors (  IR   gene family). These collectively allow insects to sense a vast array of chemical cues, including carbon dioxide and human body odours that activate and attract female mosquitoes. We identified 117 odorant receptors, 72 gustatory receptors (encoding 107 transcripts) and 135 ionotropic receptors in the AaegL5 assembly (Fig.\u00a0 , Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 \u2013 ), inferred new phylogenetic trees for each family to investigate the relationship of these receptors in   Ae. aegypti  ,   Anopheles gambiae   malaria mosquitoes and   D. melanogaster   (Extended Data Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 ), and revised expression estimates for adult male and female neural tissues using deep RNA-seq  (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). Our annotation identified 54 new ionotropic\u00a0receptor genes (Fig.\u00a0 , Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ), nearly doubling the known members of this family in   Ae. aegypti  . We additionally reannotated ionotropic receptors in   An. gambiae   and found 64 new genes. In   Ae. aegypti  , chemoreceptors are extensively clustered in tandem arrays (Fig.\u00a0  and Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ), in particular on chromosome 3p, in which over a third of all chemoreceptor genes (  n   = 111) are found within a 109-Mb stretch. Although 71 gustatory\u00a0receptor genes are scattered across chromosomes 2 and 3, only   AaegGr2  , a subunit of the carbon-dioxide receptor, is found on chromosome 1. Characterization of the full chemosensory\u00a0receptor repertoire will enable the development of novel strategies to disrupt mosquito biting behaviour. \n\n\n## Structure of the sex-determining M locus \n  \nSex determination in   Aedes   and   Culex   mosquitoes is governed by a dominant male-determining factor (M factor) at a male-determining locus (M locus) on chromosome 1 . This chromosome is homomorphic between the sexes except for the M/m karyotype, meaning that males are M/m and females are m/m. Despite the recent discovery of the M factor   Nix   in   Ae. aegypti  , which was entirely missing from the previous   Ae. aegypti   genome assemblies , the full molecular properties of the M locus remain unknown. We aligned AaegL5 (from M/m males) and AaegL4 (from m/m females), and identified a region that contained   Nix   in AaegL5 at which the assemblies diverged and that may represent the divergent M/m locus (Fig.\u00a0 ). A de novo optical map assembly spanned the putative AaegL5 M locus and extended beyond its two borders. We estimated the size of the M locus at approximately 1.5 Mb, including an approximately 163-kb gap between contigs (Fig.\u00a0 ). We tentatively identified the female m locus as the region in AaegL4 not shared with the M locus-containing chromosome 1, but note that the complete phased structure of the divergent male M locus and corresponding female m locus remain to be determined.   Nix   contains a single intron of 100 kb, while   myo-sex  , a gene encoding a myosin heavy chain protein that has previously been shown to be tightly linked to the M locus , is approximately 300 kb in length. More than 73.7% of the M locus is repetitive: long terminal repeat retrotransposons comprise 29.9% of the M locus compared to 11.7% genome-wide. Chromosomal FISH with   Nix  - and   myo-sex  -containing BAC clones  showed that these genes co-localize to the 1p pericentromeric region (1p11) in only one homologous copy of chromosome 1, supporting the placement of the M locus at this position in AaegL5 (Fig.\u00a0 ). We investigated the differentiation between the sex chromosomes (Fig.\u00a0 ) using a chromosome quotient method to quantify regions of the genome with a strictly male-specific signal . A sex-differentiated region in the LVP_AGWG strain extends to an approximately 100-Mb region surrounding the approximately 1.5-Mb M locus. This is consistent with the recent analysis of male\u2013female   F   in wild population samples and linkage map intercrosses  and could be explained by a large region of reduced recombination encompassing the centromere and M locus . The availability of a more completely assembled mosquito M locus provides opportunities to study the evolution and maintenance of homomorphic sex-determining chromosomes. The sex-determining chromosome of   Ae. aegypti   may have remained homomorphic at least since the evolutionary divergence between the   Aedes   and   Culex   genera more than 50 million years ago. With the more completely assembled M locus, we can investigate how these chromosomes have avoided the proposed eventual progression into heteromorphic sex chromosomes . \n\n\n## Structural variation and gene families \n  \nStructural variation is associated with the capacity to vector pathogens . We produced \u2018read cloud\u2019 Illumina sequencing libraries of linked reads with long-range (around 80 kb) phasing information from one male and one female mosquito using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform to investigate structural variants, including insertions, deletions, translocations and inversions, in individual mosquitoes. We observed abundant small-scale insertions and deletions (indels; 26 insertions and 81 deletions called, median 42.9 kb) and inversions and/or translocations (29 called) in these two individuals (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Eight of the inversions and translocations coincided with structural variants seen independently by Hi-C or FISH, suggesting that those variants are relatively common within this population and can be detected by different methods. AaegL5 will provide a foundation for the study of structural variants across   Ae. aegypti   populations. \n\n Hox   genes encode highly conserved transcription factors that specify segment identity along the anterior\u2013posterior body axis of all metazoans . In most vertebrates,   Hox   genes are clustered in a co-linear arrangement, although they are often disorganized or split in other animal lineages . All expected   Hox   genes are present as a single copy in   Ae. aegypti  , but we identified a split between   labial   and   proboscipedia   placing   labial   on a separate chromosome (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). We confirmed this in AaegL4, which was generated with Hi-C contact maps from a different   Ae. aegypti   strain , and note a similar arrangement in   Culex quinquefasciatus  , suggesting that it occurred before these two species diverged. Although this is not unprecedented , a unique feature of this organization is that both   labial   and   proboscipedia   appear to be close to telomeres. \n\nGlutathione   S  -transferases (GSTs) are a large multi-gene family involved in the detoxification of compounds such as insecticides. Increased GST activity has been associated with resistance to multiple classes of insecticides, including organophosphates, pyrethroids and the organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) . Amplification of detoxification genes is one mechanism by which insects can develop insecticide resistance . We found that three insect-specific GST epsilon\u00a0(GSTe) genes on chromosome 2, located centrally in the cluster (  GSTe2  ,   GSTe5\u00a0  and   GSTe7  ), are duplicated four times in AaegL5 relative to AaegL3 (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Short Illumina read coverage and optical maps confirmed the copy number and arrangement of these duplications in AaegL5 (Fig.\u00a0 ), and analysis of whole-genome sequencing data for four additional laboratory colonies showed variable copy numbers across this gene cluster (Fig.\u00a0 ). GSTe2 is a highly efficient metaboliser of DDT , and it is noteworthy that the cDNA from three GST genes in the quadruplication was detected at higher levels in DDT-resistant   Ae. aegypti   mosquitoes from southeast Asia . \n\n\n## Genome-wide genetic variation \n  \nMeasurement of genetic variation within and between populations is important for inferring ongoing and historic evolution in a species . To understand genomic diversity in   Ae. aegypti  , which spread in the last century from Africa to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, we performed whole-genome resequencing on four laboratory colonies. Chromosomal patterns of nucleotide diversity should correlate with regional differences in meiotic recombination rates . We observed pronounced declines in genetic diversity near the centre of each chromosome (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ), providing independent corroboration of the estimated position of each centromere by Hi-C (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTo investigate linkage disequilibrium in geographically diverse populations of   Ae. aegypti  , we first mapped Affymetrix SNP-Chip markers that were designed using AaegL3  to positions on AaegL5. We genotyped 28 individuals from two populations from Amacuzac, Mexico and Lop\u00e9 National Park, Gabon and calculated the pairwise linkage disequilibrium of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1-kb bins both genome-wide and within each chromosome (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). The maximum linkage disequilibrium in the Mexican population is approximately twice that of the population from Gabon, which probably reflects a recent bottleneck associated with the spread of this species out of Africa. \n\n\n## Dengue competence and pyrethroid resistance \n  \nTo illustrate the value of AaegL5 for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs), we used restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) markers to locate QTLs underlying dengue virus (DENV) vector competence. We identified and genotyped RAD markers in the F  progeny of a laboratory cross between wild   Ae. aegypti   founders from Thailand  (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). For this population, 197 F  females had previously been scored for DENV vector competence against four different DENV isolates (two isolates from serotype 1 and two from serotype 3) . The newly developed linkage map included a total of 255 RAD markers (Fig.\u00a0 ) with perfect concordance between genetic distances in centiMorgans (cM) and AaegL5 physical coordinates in Mb (Fig.\u00a0 ). We detected two significant QTLs on chromosome 2 that underlie the likelihood of DENV dissemination from the midgut (that is, systemic infection), an important component of DENV vector competence . One QTL was associated with a generalist effect across DENV serotypes and isolates, whereas the other was associated with an isolate-specific effect (Fig.\u00a0 ). QTL mapping powered by AaegL5 will make it possible to understand the genetic basis of   Ae. aegypti   vector competence for arboviruses. \n\nPyrethroid insecticides are used to combat mosquitoes, including   Ae. aegypti  , and emerging resistance to these compounds is a global problem . Understanding the mechanisms that underlie insecticide targets and resistance in different mosquito populations is critical to combating arboviral pathogens. Many insecticides act on ion channels, and we curated members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (Cys-loop LGIC) superfamily in AaegL5. We found 22 subunit-encoding Cys-loop LGICs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ), of which 14 encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. nAChRs consist of a core group of subunit-encoding genes (\u03b11\u2013\u03b18 and \u03b21) that are highly conserved between insect species, and at least one divergent subunit . Whereas   D. melanogaster   possesses only one divergent nAChR subunit,   Ae. aegypti   has five. We found that agricultural and veterinary insecticides impaired the motility of   Ae. aegypti   larvae (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that these Cys-loop LGIC-targeting compounds have potential as mosquito larvicides. The improved annotation presented here provides a valuable resource for investigating insecticide efficacy. \n\nTo demonstrate how a chromosome-scale genome assembly informs genetic mechanisms of insecticide resistance, we performed a genome-wide population genetic screen for SNPs correlating with resistance to deltamethrin in   Ae. aegypti   collected in Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, where pyrethroid-resistant and -susceptible populations co-exist (Fig.\u00a0 ). We uncovered an association with non-synonymous changes to three amino acid residues of the voltage-gated sodium channel VGSC, a known target of pyrethroids (Fig.\u00a0 ). The gene model for\u00a0  VGSC  , a complex locus spanning nearly 500 kb in AaegL5, was incomplete and highly fragmented in AaegL3. SNPs in this region have a lower expected heterozygosity (  H  ) in the resistant compared to the susceptible population, suggesting that they are part of a selective sweep for the resistance phenotype surrounding\u00a0  VGSC   (Fig.\u00a0 ). Accurately associating SNPs with phenotypes requires a fully assembled genome, and we expect that AaegL5 will be critical to understanding the evolution of insecticide resistance and other important traits. \n\n\n## Summary \n  \nThe high-quality genome assembly and annotation described here will enable major advances in mosquito biology, and has already allowed us to carry out a number of experiments that were previously impossible. The highly contiguous AaegL5 genome permitted high-resolution genome-wide analysis of genetic variation and the mapping of loci for DENV vector competence and insecticide resistance. A new appreciation of copy number variation in insecticide-detoxifying\u00a0  GSTe  \u00a0genes and a more complete accounting of Cys-loop LGICs will catalyse the search for new resistance-breaking insecticides. A doubling in the known number of chemosensory ionotropic receptors provides opportunities to link odorants and tastants on human skin to mosquito attraction, a key first step in the development of novel mosquito repellents. \u2018Sterile Insect Technique\u2019 and \u2018Incompatible Insect Technique\u2019 show great promise to suppress mosquito populations , but these population suppression methods require that only males are released. A strategy that connects a gene for male determination to a gene drive construct has been proposed to effectively bias the population towards males over multiple generations , and improved understanding of M locus evolution and the function of its genetic content should facilitate genetic control of mosquitoes that infect many hundreds of millions of people with arboviruses every year . \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data reporting \n  \nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. \n\n\n### Ethics information \n  \nThe participation of one\u00a0human\u00a0subject in blood-feeding mosquitoes\u00a0was approved and monitored by The Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol LVO-0652). This subject gave their written and\u00a0informed consent to participate. \n\n\n### Mosquito rearing and DNA preparation \n  \n Ae. aegypti   eggs from a strain labelled \u2018LVP_ib12\u2019 were supplied by M.V.S. from a colony maintained at Virginia Tech. We performed a single pair cross between a male and female individual to generate material for Hi-C, Bionano optical mapping, flow cytometry, SNP-Chip analysis of strain variance, paired-end Illumina sequencing and 10X Genomics linked reads (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). The same single male was crossed to a single female in two additional generations to generate high-molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA for Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing and to establish a colony (LVP_AGWG). Rearing was performed as previously described  and all animals were offered a human arm as a blood source. \n\n\n### SNP analysis of mosquito strains \n  \nData were generated as described , and PCA was performed using LEA 2.0 available for R v.3.4.0 . The following strains were used:   Ae. aegypti   LVP_AGWG (samples from the laboratory strain used for the AaegL5 genome assembly, reared as described in Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  by a single pair mating in 2016 from a strain labelled LVP_ib12 maintained at Virginia Tech),   Ae. aegypti   LVP_ib12 (laboratory strain, LVP_ib12, provided in 2013 by D. Severson, University of Notre Dame),   Ae. aegypti   LVP_MR4 (laboratory strain labelled LVP_ib12 obtained in 2016 from MR4 at the Centers for Disease Control via BEI Resources catalogue MRA-735),   Ae. aegypti   Yaounde, Cameroon (field specimens collected in 2014 and provided by B. Kamgang),   Ae. aegypti   Rockefeller (laboratory strain provided in 2016 by G. Dimopoulos, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health),   Ae. aegypti   Key West, Florida (field specimens collected in 2016 and provided by W. Tabachnick). Strains used for the linkage disequilibrium data presented in Extended Data Fig. 9c, d were:   Ae. aegypti   from Amacuzac, Morelos, Mexico (field specimens collected in 2016 and provided by C. Gonzalez Acosta) and   Ae. aegypti   from La Lope National park forest, Gabon (field specimens collected and provided by S. Xia). \n\n\n### Flow cytometry \n  \nGenome size was estimated by flow cytometry as described , except that the propidium iodide was added at a concentration of 25 \u03bcl mg , not 50 \u03bcl mg , and samples were stained in the cold and dark for 24 h to allow the stain to fully saturate the sample. In brief, nuclei were isolated by placing a single frozen head of an adult sample along with a single frozen head of an adult   Drosophila virilis   female standard from a strain with 1C = 328 Mb into 1 ml of Galbraith buffer (4.26 g MgCl , 8.84 g sodium citrate, 4.2 g 3-[  N  -morpholino] propane sulfonic acid (MOPS), 1 ml Triton X-100 and 1 mg boiled RNase A in 1 l of ddH O, adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl and filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter)  and grinding with 15 strokes of the A pestle at a rate of 3 strokes per 2 s. The resultant ground mixture was filtered through a 60-\u03bcm nylon filter (Spectrum Labs). Samples were stained with 25 \u03bcg of propidium iodide and held in the cold (4 \u00b0C) and dark for 24 h at which time the relative red fluorescence of the 2C nuclei of the standard and sample were determined using a Beckman Coulter CytoFlex flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm. At least 2,000 nuclei were scored under each 2C peak and all scored peaks had a coefficient of variation of 2.5 or less . Average channel numbers for sample and standard 2C peaks were scored using CytExpert software version 1.2.8.0 supplied with the CytoFlex flow cytometer. Significant differences among strains were determined using Proc GLM in SAS with both a Tukey and a Sheff\u00e9 option. Significance levels were the same with either option. Genome size was determined as the ratio of the mean channel number of the 2C sample peak divided by the mean channel number of the 2C   D. virilis   standard peak times 328 Mb, where 328 Mb is the amount of DNA in a gamete of the standard. The following species/strains were used:   Ae. mascarensis   (collected by A. Bheecarry on Mauritius in December 2014. Colonized and maintained by J.R.P.),   Ae. aegypti   Ho Chi Minh City F13 (provided by D. J. Gubler, Duke-National University of Singapore as F  eggs from females collected in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, between August and September 2013. Colonized and maintained for 13 generations by A.G.-S.),   Ae. aegypti   Rockefeller (laboratory strain provided by D. Severson, Notre Dame),   Ae. aegypti   LVP_AGWG (reared as described in Extended Data Fig.\u00a0  from a strain labelled LVP_ib12 maintained by M.V.S. at Virginia Tech),   Ae. aegypti   New Orleans F8 (collected by D. Wesson in New Orleans 2014, colonized and maintained by J.R.P. through 8 generations of single pair mating),   Ae. aegypti   Uganda 49-ib-G5 (derived by C.S.M. through 5 generations of full-sibling mating of the U49 colony established from eggs collected by J.-P. Mutebi in Entebbe, Uganda in March 2015). \n\n\n### Pacific Biosciences library construction, sequencing and assembly \n  \n#### HMW DNA extraction for Pacific Biosciences sequencing \n  \nHMW DNA extraction for Pacific Biosciences sequencing was performed using the Qiagen MagAttract Kit (67563) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with approximately 80 male sibling pupae in batches of 25 mg. \n\n\n#### SMRTbell library construction and sequencing \n  \nThree libraries were constructed using the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences). In brief, genomic DNA (gDNA) was mechanically sheared to 60 kb using the Megaruptor system (Diagenode) followed by DNA damage repair and DNA end repair. Universal blunt hairpin adapters were then ligated onto the gDNA molecules after which non-SMRTbell molecules were removed with exonuclease. Pulse-field gels were run to assess the quality of the SMRTbell libraries. Two libraries were size-selected using SageELF (Sage Science) at 30 kb and 20 kb, the third library was size-selected at 20 kb using BluePippin (Sage Science). Prior to sequencing, another DNA-damage repair step was performed and quality was assessed with pulse-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 177 SMRT cells were run on the RS II using P6-C4 chemistry and 6 h videos. \n\n\n#### Contig assembly and polishing \n  \nA diploid contig assembly was carried out using FALCON v.0.4.0 followed by the FALCON-Unzip module (revision 74eefabdcc4849a8cef24d1a1bbb27d953247bd7) . The resulting assembly contains primary contigs, a partially phased haploid representation of the genome and haplotigs, which represent phased alternative alleles for a subset of the genome. Two rounds of contig polishing were performed. For the first round, as part of the FALCON-Unzip pipeline, primary contigs and secondary haplotigs were polished using haplotype-phased reads and the Quiver consensus caller . For the second round of polishing we used the \u2018resequencing\u2019 pipeline in SMRT Link v.3.1, with primary contigs and haplotigs concatenated into a single reference. Resequencing maps all raw reads to the combined assembly reference with BLASR (v.3.1.0) , followed by consensus calling with Arrow ( ) . \n\n\n\n### Hi-C sample preparation and analysis \n  \n#### Library preparation \n  \nIn brief, insect tissue was crosslinked and homogenized. The nuclei were then extracted and permeabilized, and libraries were prepared using a modified version of the in situ Hi-C protocol that we optimized for insect tissue . Separate libraries were prepared for samples derived from three individual male pupae. The resulting libraries were sequenced to yield 118 million, 249 million and 114 million reads (coverage: 120\u00d7) and these were processed using Juicer . \n\n\n#### Hi-C approach \n  \nUsing the results of FALCON-Unzip as input, we used Hi-C to correct misjoins, to order and orient contigs, and to merge overlaps (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). The Hi-C based assembly procedure that we used is described in detail in the\u00a0  and  . Notably, both primary contigs and haplotigs were used as input. This was essential, because Hi-C data identified genomic loci in which the corresponding sequence was absent in the primary FALCON-Unzip contigs, and present only in the haplotigs; the loci would have led to gaps, instead of contiguous sequence, if the haplotigs were excluded from the Hi-C assembly process (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Hi-C scaffolding \n  \nWe set aside 359 FALCON-Unzip contigs shorter than 20 kb, because such contigs are more difficult to accurately assemble using Hi-C. To generate chromosome-length scaffolds, we used the Hi-C maps and the remaining contigs as inputs to the previously described algorithms . Note that both primary contigs and haplotigs were used as input. We performed quality control, manual polishing and validation of the scaffolding results using Assembly Tools . This produced three chromosome-length scaffolds. Notably, the contig N50 decreased slightly, to 929,392 bp, because of the splitting of misjoined contigs. \n\n\n#### Hi-C alternative haplotype merging \n  \nExamination of the initial chromosome-length scaffolds using Assembly Tools  revealed that extensive undercollapsed heterozygosity was present. In fact, most genomic intervals were repeated, with variations, on two or more unmerged contigs. This suggested that the levels of undercollapsed heterozygosity were unusually high, and that the true genome length was far shorter than either the total length of the Pacific Biosciences contigs (2,047 Mb), or the initial chromosome-length scaffolds (1,973 Mb). Possible factors that could have contributed to the unusually high rate of undercollapsed heterozygosity seen in the FALCON-Unzip Pacific Biosciences contigs relative to prior contig sets for   Ae. aegypti   generated using Sanger sequencing (AaegL3) , include high heterozygosity levels in the species and incomplete inbreeding in the samples that we sequenced. The merge algorithm described previously  detects and merges draft contigs that overlap one another owing to undercollapsed heterozygosity. Because undercollapsed heterozygosity does not affect most loci in a typical draft assembly, the default parameters are relatively stringent. We adopted more permissive parameters for AaegL5 to accommodate the exceptionally high levels of undercollapsed heterozygosity, but found that the results would occasionally merge contigs that did not overlap. To avoid these false positives, we developed a procedure to manually identify and \u2018whitelist\u2019 regions of the genome containing no overlap, based on both Hi-C maps and LASTZ alignments (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ,   and  ). We then reran the merge step, using the whitelist as an additional input. Finally, we performed quality control of the results using Assembly Tools , which confirmed the absence of the undercollapsed heterozygosity that we had previously observed. The resulting assembly contained three chromosome-length scaffolds (310 Mb, 473 Mb and 409 Mb), which spanned 94% of the merged sequence length. The assembly also contained 2,364 small scaffolds, which spanned the remaining 6% (Table\u00a0 ). These lengths were consistent with the results of flow cytometry and the lengths obtained in prior assemblies.\u00a0Notably, the merging of overlapping contigs using the above procedure frequently eliminated gaps, and thus greatly increased the contig N50, from 929,392 to 4,997,917 bp. \n\n\n\n### Final gap-filling and polishing \n  \n#### Scaffolded assembly polishing \n  \nFollowing scaffolding and de-duplication, we performed a final round of arrow polishing. PBJelly  from PBSuite version 15.8.24 was used for gapfilling of the de-duplicated HiC assembly (see \u2018Protocol.xml\u2019 in\u00a0  and  ). After PBJelly, the liftover file was used to translate the renamed scaffolds to their original identifiers. For this final polishing step (run with SMRT Link v3.1 resequencing), the reference sequence included the scaffolded, gap-filled reference, as well as all contigs and contig fragments not included in the final scaffolds ( ). This reduces the likelihood that reads map to the wrong haplotype, by providing both haplotypes as targets for read mapping. For submission to NCBI, two scaffolds identified as mitochondrial in origin were removed (see below), and all remaining gaps on scaffolds were standardized to a length of 100 Ns to indicate a gap of unknown size. The assembly quality value was estimated using independent Illumina sequencing data from a single individual male pupa (library H2NJHADXY_1/2). Reads were aligned with BWA-MEM v.0.7.12-r1039 . FreeBayes v.1.1.0-50-g61527c5-dirty  was used to call SNPs and short indels with the parameters -C 2 -0 -O -q 20 -z 0.10 -E 0 -X -u -p 2 -F 0.6. Any SNP and short indels showing heterozygosity (for example, 0/1 genotype) were excluded. The quality value was estimated at 34.75 using the PHRED formula with SNPs as the numerator (597,798) and number of bases with at least threefold coverage as the denominator, including alternate alleles (1,782,885,792). \n\n\n#### Identification of mitochondrial contigs \n  \nDuring the submission process for this genome, two contigs were identified as mitochondrial in origin and were removed from the genomic assembly, manually circularized, and submitted separately. The mitochondrial genome is available as GenBank accession number MF194022.1, RefSeq accession number NC_035159.1. \n\n\n\n### Bionano optical mapping \n  \n#### HMW DNA extraction \n  \nHMW DNA extraction was performed using the Bionano Animal Tissue DNA Isolation Kit (RE-013-10), with a few protocol modifications. A single-cell suspension was made as follows. First, 47 mg of frozen male pupae was fixed in 2% v/v formaldehyde in Homogenization Buffer from the kit (Bionano 20278), for 2 min on ice. Then, the pupae were roughly homogenized by blending for 2 s, using a rotor\u2013stator tissue homogenizer (TissueRuptor, Qiagen 9001271). After another 2 min fixation, the tissue was finely homogenized by running the rotor\u2013stator for 10 s. Subsequently, the homogenate was filtered with a 100-\u03bcm nylon filter, fixed with ethanol for 30 min on ice, spun down, and washed with more Homogenization Buffer (to remove residual formaldehyde). The final pellet was resuspended in Homogenization Buffer. A single agarose plug was made using the resuspended cells, using the CHEF Mammalian Genomic DNA Plug Kit (BioRad 170-3591), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The plug was incubated with Lysis Buffer (Bionano 20270) and Puregene Proteinase K (Qiagen 1588920) overnight at 50 \u00b0C, then again the following morning for 2 h (using new buffer and Proteinase K). The plug was washed, melted and solubilized with GELase (Epicentre G09200). The purified DNA was subjected to 4 h of drop dialysis (Millipore, VCWP04700) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes P11496). \n\n\n#### DNA labelling \n  \nDNA was labelled according to commercial protocols using the DNA Labelling Kit NLRS (RE-012-10, Bionano Genomics). Specifically, 300 ng of purified genomic DNA was nicked with 7 U nicking endonuclease Nt.BspQI (New England BioLabs, NEB) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in NEBuffer3. The nicked DNA was labelled with a fluorescent-dUTP nucleotide analogue using Taq polymerase (NEB) for 1 h at 72 \u00b0C. After labelling, the nicks were ligated with Taq ligase (NEB) in the presence of dNTPs. The backbone of fluorescently labelled DNA was counterstained with YOYO-1 (Invitrogen). \n\n\n#### Data collection \n  \nThe DNA was loaded onto the nanochannel array of Bionano Genomics IrysChip by electrophoresis of DNA. Linearized DNA molecules were then imaged automatically followed by repeated cycles of DNA loading using the Bionano Genomics Irys system. The DNA-molecule backbones (YOYO-1 stained) and locations of fluorescent labels along each molecule were detected using the in-house-generated software package, IrysView. The set of label locations of each DNA molecule defines an individual single-molecule map. After filtering data using normal parameters (molecule reads with length greater than 150 kb, a minimum of 8 labels and standard filters for label and backbone signals), a total of 299 Gb and 259 Gb of data were collected from Nt.BspQI and Nb.BssSI samples, respectively. \n\n\n#### De novo genome map assembly \n  \nDe novo assembly was performed with non-haplotype aware settings (optArguments_nonhaplotype_noES_irys.xml) and pre-release version of Bionano Solve3.1 (Pipeline version 6703 and RefAligner version 6851). On the basis of the overlap\u2013layout\u2013Consensus paradigm, pairwise comparisons of all DNA molecules were performed to create an overlap graph, which was then used to create the initial consensus genome maps. By realigning molecules to the genome maps (RefineB   P   = 10 \u00d7 10 ) and by using only the best match molecules, a refinement step was performed to refine the label positions on the genome maps and to remove chimeric joins. Next, during an extension step, the software aligned molecules to genome maps (extension,   P   = 10 \u00d7 10 ), and extended the maps based on the molecules aligning past the map ends. Overlapping genome maps were then merged using a merge   P  -value cut-off of 10   P   = 10 \u00d7 10 . These extension and merge steps were repeated five times before a final refinement was applied to \u2018finish\u2019 all genome maps (refine final,   P   = 10 \u00d7 10 ). Two genome map de novo assemblies, one with nickase Nt.BspQI and the other with nickase Nb.BssSI, were constructed. Alignments between the constructed de novo genome assemblies and the L5 assembly were performed using a dynamic programming approach with a scoring function and a   P  -value cutoff of   P   = 10 \u00d7 10 . \n\n\n\n### Transposable element identification \n  \n#### Identification of known transposon elements \n  \nWe first identified known transposable elements using RepeatMasker (version 3.2.6)  against the mosquito TEfam ( , data downloaded July 2017), a manually curated mosquito transposable-elements database. We then ran RepeatMasker using the TEfam database and Repbase transposable-elements library (version 10.05). RepeatMasker was set to default parameters with the -s (slow search) flag and NCBI/RMblast program (v.2.2.28). \n\n\n#### De novo repeat family identification \n  \nWe searched for repeat families and consensus sequences using the de novo repeat prediction tool RepeatModeler (version 1.0.8)  using default parameters with RECON (version 1.07) and RepeatScout (1.0.5) as core programs. Consensus sequences were generated and classified for each repeat family. Then RepeatMasker was run on the genome sequences, using the RepeatModeler consensus sequence as the library. \n\n\n#### Tandem repeats \n  \nWe also predicted tandem repeats in the whole genome and in the repeatmasked genome using Tandem Repeat Finder . Long tandem copies were identified using the \u2018Match=2, Mismatch=7, Delta=7, PM=80, PI=10, Minscore=50 MaxPeriod=500\u2019 parameters. Simple repeats, satellites and low complexity repeats were found using \u2018Match=2, Mismatch=7, Delta=7, PM=80, PI=10, Minscore=50, and MaxPeriod=12\u2019 parameters. \n\nA file representing the coordinates of all identified repeat and transposable-element structures in AaegL5 can be found at  . \n\n\n\n### Generation of RefSeq gene set annotation \n  \nThe AaegL5 assembly was deposited at NCBI in June 2017 and annotated using the NCBI RefSeq Eukaryotic gene annotation pipeline . Evidence to support the gene predictions came from over 9 billion Illumina RNA-seq reads, 67,000 Pacific Biosciences IsoSeq transcripts, 300,000 expressed sequence tags and well-supported proteins from   D. melanogaster   and other insects. Annotation Release 101 was made public in July 2017, and specific gene families were subjected to manual annotation and curation. Detailed descriptions of the manual annotation and curation of multigene families (  Hox   genes, proteases, opsins and biogenic amine receptors, chemosensory receptors and LGICs) can be found in the\u00a0  and  . See also  . \n\n\n### Alignment of RNA-seq data to AaegL5 and quantification of gene expression \n  \nPublished RNA-seq reads  and unpublished RNA-seq reads from tissue-specific libraries produced by Verily Life Sciences were mapped to the RefSeq assembly GCF_002204515.2_AaegL5.0 with STAR aligner (v.2.5.3a)  using the two-pass approach. Reads were first aligned in the absence of gene annotations using the following parameters: --outFilterType BySJout; --alignIntronMax 1000000; --alignMatesGapMax 1000000; --outFilterMismatchNmax 999; --outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.04; --clip3pNbases 1; --outSAMstrandField intronMotif; --outSAMattrIHstart 0; --outFilterMultimapNmax 20; --outSAMattributes NH HI AS NM MD; --outSAMattrRGline; --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate. Splice junctions identified during the first pass mapping of individual libraries were combined and supplied to STAR using the --sjdbFileChrStartEnd option for the second pass. Reads mapping to gene models defined by the NCBI annotation pipeline (GCF_002204515.2_AaegL5.0_genomic.gff) were quantified using featureCounts  with default parameters. Count data were transformed to transcripts per million values using a custom Perl script. Details on libraries, alignment statistics and gene expression estimates (expressed in transcripts per million) are provided as Supplementary Data\u00a0 \u2013 . \n\n\n### Identification of \u2018collapsed\u2019 and \u2018merged\u2019 gene models from AaegL3.5 to AaegL5.0 \n  \nVectorBase annotation AaegL3.5 was compared to NCBI   Ae. aegypti   annotation release 101 on AaegL5.0 using custom code developed at NCBI as part of NCBI\u2019s eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline. First, assembly\u2013assembly alignments were generated for AaegL3 (GCA_000004015.3) \u00d7 AaegL5.0 (GCF_002204515.2) as part of NCBI\u2019s Remap coordinate remapping service, as described at  . The alignments are publicly available in NCBI\u2019s Genome Data Viewer ( ), the Remap interface, and by FTP in either ASN.1 or GFF3 format ( ). Alignments are categorized as either \u2018first pass\u2019 (reciprocity = 3) or \u2018second pass\u2019 (reciprocity = 1 or 2). First pass alignments are reciprocal best alignments, and are used to identify regions on the two assemblies that can be considered equivalent. Second pass alignments are cases in which two regions of one assembly have their best alignment to the same region on the other assembly. These are interpreted to represent regions in which two paralogous regions in AaegL3 have been collapsed into a single region in AaegL5, or vice versa. \n\nFor comparing the two annotations, both annotations were converted to ASN.1 format and compared using an internal NCBI program that identifies regions of overlap between gene, mRNA and coding sequence (CDS) features projected through the assembly\u2013assembly alignments. The comparison was performed twice, first using only the first pass alignments, and again using only the second pass alignments corresponding to regions in which duplication in the AaegL3 assembly had been collapsed. Gene features were compared, requiring at least some overlapping CDS in both the old and new annotation to avoid noise from overlapping genes and comparisons between coding and non-coding genes. AaegL5.0 genes that matched to two or more VectorBase AaegL3.5 genes were identified. Matches were further classified as collapsed paralogues if one or more of the matches was through the second pass alignments, or as improvements due to increased contiguity or annotation refinement if the matches were through first pass alignments (for example, two AaegL3.5 genes represent the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of a single gene on AaegL5.0, such as\u00a0  sex peptide receptor  . Detailed lists of merged genes are in Supplementary Data\u00a0 ,  . \n\n\n### Comparison of alignment to AaegL3.4 and AaegL5.0 \n  \nThe sequences comprising transcripts from the AaegL5.0 gene set annotation were extracted from coordinates provided in GCF_002204515.2_AaegL5.0_genomic.gtf. Sequences corresponding to AaegL3.4 gene set annotations were downloaded from Vectorbase ( ). Salmon (v.0.8.2)  indices were generated with default parameters, and all libraries described in Supplementary Data\u00a0  were mapped to both AaegL3.4 and AaegL5 sequences using \u2018quant\u2019 mode with default parameters. Mapping results are presented as Supplementary Data\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### ATAC-seq \n  \nThe previously described ATAC-seq protocol  was adapted for   Ae. aegypti   brains. Individual brains from LVP_MR4 non-blood-fed females (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ) or females 48 h or 96 h after taking a human blood meal (data not shown) were dissected in 1\u00d7 PBS, immediately placed in 100 \u03bcl ice-cold ATAC lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl , 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630), and homogenized in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube using 50 strokes of a Wheaton 1-ml PTFE-tapered tissue grinder. Animals at 96 h after the blood meal were deprived of access to a water oviposition site and were considered gravid at the time of dissection. Lysed brains were centrifuged at 400  g   for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatant was discarded. Nuclei were resuspended in 52.5 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 Tagmentation buffer (provided in the Illumina Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit) and 5 \u03bcl were removed to count nuclei on a haemocytometer. In total, 50,000 nuclei were used for each transposition reaction. The concentration of nuclei in Tagmentation buffer was adjusted to 50,000 nuclei in 47.5 \u03bcl Tagmentation buffer and 2.5 \u03bcl Tn5 enzyme was added (provided in the Illumina Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit). The remainder of the ATAC-seq protocol was performed as described . The final library was purified and size-selected using double-sided AMPure XP beads (0.6\u00d7, 0.7\u00d7). The library was checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Resulting libraries were sequenced as 75-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform at an average read depth of 30.5 million reads per sample. Raw fastq reads were checked for nucleotide distribution and read quality using FASTQC ( ) and mapped to the AaegL5 and AaegL3 versions of the   Ae. aegypti   genome using Bowtie v.2.2.9 . Aligned reads were processed using Samtools 1.3.1  and Picard 2.6.0 ( ) and only uniquely mapped and non-redundant reads were used for downstream analyses. To compare the annotation and assembly of the   sex peptide receptor   gene in AaegL3 and AaegL5, we used NCBI BLAST  to identify AAEL007405 and AAEL010313 as gene fragments in AaegL3.4 annotation that map to\u00a0  sex peptide receptor  \u00a0in the AaegL5.0 genome (BLAST   E   values for both queries mapping to\u00a0  sex peptide receptor  \u00a0were 0.0). Next, we used GMAP  to align AAEL007405 and AAEL010313 fasta sequences to AaegL5. The resulting GFF3 annotation file was used by Gviz  to plot RNA-seq reads and sashimi plots as well as ATAC-seq reads in the region containing\u00a0  sex peptide receptor  . Transcription start site analysis was performed using HOMER v.4.9 . In brief, databases containing 2-kb windows flanking transcription start sites genome-wide were generated using the \u2018parseGTF.pl\u2019 HOMER script from AaegL3.4 and AaegL5.0 GFF3 annotation files. Duplicate transcription start sites and transcription start sites that were within 20 bp from each other were merged using the \u2018mergePeaks\u2019 HOMER script. Coverage of ATAC-seq fragments in predicted transcription start site regions was calculated with the \u2018annotatePeaks.pl\u2019 script. Fold change in predicted transcription site regions was calculated by dividing the ATAC fragments per base pair per predicted transcription start site in the AaegL5.0 genome by ATAC fragments per base pair per predicted transcription start site in the AaegL3.4 genome at the 0 base pair point in each predicted transcription start site. Coverage histograms were plotted using ggplot v.2 2.2.1 in RStudio v.1.1.383, R v.3.4.2 . \n\n\n### M locus analysis \n  \n#### Aligning chromosome assemblies and Bionano scaffolds \n  \nThe boundaries of the M locus were identified by comparing the current AaegL5 assembly and the AaegL4 assembly  using a program called LAST  (data not shown). To overcome the challenges of repetitive hits, both AaegL5 and AaegL4 assemblies were twice repeat-masked  against a combined repeat library of TEfam-annotated transposable elements ( )  and a RepeatModeler output  from the   Anopheles   16 Genomes project . The masked sequences were then compared using BLASTn  and we then set a filter for downstream analysis to include only alignment with \u226598% identity over 1,000 bp. After the identification of the approximate boundaries of the M locus (and m locus), which contains two male-specific genes,   myo-sex   and   Nix  , we zoomed in by performing the same analysis on regions of the M locus and m locus plus 2 Mb flanking regions without repeatmasking. In this and subsequent analyses, only alignment with \u226598% identity over 500 bp were included. Consequently, approximate coordinates of the M locus and m locus were obtained on chromosome 1 of the AaegL5 and AaegL4 assemblies, respectively. Super-scaffold_63 in the Bionano optical map assembly was identified by BLASTN  that spans the entire M locus and extends beyond its two borders. \n\n\n#### Chromosome quotient analysis \n  \nThe chromosome quotient (CQ)  was calculated for each 1,000-bp window across all AaegL5 chromosomes. To calculate the CQ, Illumina reads were generated from two paired sibling female and male sequencing libraries. To generate libraries for CQ analysis, we performed two separate crosses of a single LVP_AGWG male to 10 virgin females. Eggs from this cross were hatched, and virgin male and female adults collected within 12 h of eclosion to verify their non-mated status. We generated genomic DNA from five males and five females from each of these crosses. Sheared genomic DNA was used to generate libraries for Illumina sequencing with the Illumina TruSeq Nano kit and sequencing performed on one lane of 150-bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 in high-output mode. \n\nFor a given sequence   S   of a 1,000-bp window,  , where   is the number of female Illumina reads aligned to   S  , and   is the number of male Illumina reads aligned to   S  . Normalization was not necessary for these datasets because the mean and median CQs of the autosomes (chromosomes 2 and 3) are all near 1. A CQ value lower than the 0.05 indicates that the sequences within the corresponding 1,000-bp window had at least 20-fold more hits to the male Illumina data than to the female Illumina data. Not every 1,000-bp window produces a CQ value because many were completely masked by RepeatMasker . To ensure that each CQ value represents a meaningful data point obtained with sufficient alignments, only sequences with more than 20 male hits were included in the calculation. The CQ values were then plotted against the chromosome location of the 1,000-bp window (Fig.\u00a0 ). Under these conditions, there is not a single 1,000-bp fragment on chromosomes 2 and 3 that showed CQ = 0.05 or lower. \n\n\n#### Chromosome FISH \n  \nSlides of mitotic chromosomes were prepared from imaginal discs of fourth instar larvae following published protocols . BAC clones were obtained from the University of Liverpool  or from a previously described BAC library . BACs were plated on agar plates (Thermo Fisher) and a single bacterial colony was used to grow an overnight bacterial culture in LB broth plates (Thermo Fisher) at 37 \u00b0C. DNA from the BACs was extracted using Sigma PhasePrep TM BAC DNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, NA-0100). BAC DNA for hybridization was labelled by nick translation with Cy3-, Cy5-dUTP (Enzo Life Sciences) or Fluorescein 12-dUTP (Thermo Fisher). Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI in Prolong Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher). Slides were analysed using a Zeiss LSM 880 Laser Scanning Microscope at 1,000\u00d7 magnification. We note that localization of the M-locus to 1p11 is supported by both FISH and genomic analyses, but is contrary to a previously published placement at 1q21 . \n\n\n\n### Identification and analysis of   Ae. aegypti   GST and P450 genes and validation of the repeat structure of the GSTe cluster \n  \nGenes were initially extracted from the AaegL5.0 genome annotation (NCBI release 101) by text search and filtered to remove \u2018off target\u2019 matches (for example, \u2018cytochrome P450 reductase\u2019), then predicted protein sequences of a small number of representative transcripts were used to search the protein set using BLASTp, to identify by sequence similarity sequences not captured by the text search (resulting in two additional P450s, no GSTs). For each gene family, predicted protein sequences were used to search the proteins of the AaegL3.4 gene set using BLASTp. All best matches, and additional matches with amino acid identity >90% were tabulated for each gene family (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ) to identify both closely related paralogues and alleles annotated as paralogues in AaegL3.4. On the basis of a BLASTp search against the AaegL3.4 protein set, the two putative P450 genes not annotated as such in AaegL5.0 (encoding proteins XP_001649103.2 and XP_021694388.1) appear to be incorrect gene models in the AaegL5.0 annotation, which should in fact be two adjacent genes (  CYP9J20   and   CYP9J21   for XP_001649103.2;   CYP6P12   and   CYP6BZ1   for XP_021694388.1). Compared to AaegL3.4, which predicts a single copy each of\u00a0  GSTe2  ,   GSTe5   and   GSTe7  ,\u00a0the NCBI annotation of AaegL5.0 predicts three copies each of\u00a0  GSTe2   and   GSTe5  , and four copies of\u00a0  GSTe7  , arranged in a repeat structure. BLASTn searches revealed one additional copy each of\u00a0  GSTe2   and   GSTe5\u00a0  in the third duplicated unit. Both contain premature termination codons owing to frameshifts, but these could be owing to uncorrected errors in the assembly. Error correction of all duplicated units was not possible owing to the inability to unequivocally align reads to units not \u2018anchored\u2019 to adjacent single-copy sequence. \n\nTo validate these tandem duplications, two lanes of Illumina whole-genome sequence data from a single pupa of the LVP_AGWG strain (H2NJHADXY) were aligned to a hard-masked version of the AaegL3 reference genome using Bowtie2 v.2.2.4 , with \u2018--very-fast-local\u2019 alignment parameters, an expected fragment size between 0 and 1,500 bp and relative orientation \u2018forward\u2013reverse\u2019 (\u2018-I 0 -X 1500 \u2013fr\u2019). Aligned reads with a mapping quality less than 10 were removed using Samtools . \u2018featureCounts\u2019, part of the \u2018Subread\u2019 v.1.5.0-p2 package , was used to assign read pairs or reads (\u2018tags\u2019) aligned to either DNA strand (\u2018-s 0\u2019) and overlapping the coding regions of a gene by at least 100 bp (\u2018-t CDS\u2013minOverlap 100\u2019) to genes as an estimate of representation in the genome. Gene-wise tag counts were normalized by calculating the fragments per kilobase of gene length per million mapped reads (FPKM), using the following equation: (tag count/gene length in kb)/(sum of tag counts for all genes in genome/1,000,000). \n\nMedian FPKM for all genes in the genome was calculated (48.22), allowing FPKM of GSTe genes to be expressed relative to this. To examine strain differences in coverage at this cluster, we repeated this analysis for the four laboratory colonies analysed in Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 . Median FPKM values across all genes ranged from 47.68 to 48.46 and gene-wise FPKM values normalized relative to these medians are plotted in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nTo visualize the sequence identity of the repeat structure in the GSTe cluster (Fig.\u00a0 ), we extracted the region spanning the cluster from AaegL5 chromosome 2 (351,597,324\u2013351,719,186 bp) and performed alignment of Pacific Biosciences reads using minimap2 v2.1.1 (minimap2 -DP -k7 -w1 -B2 -r200 -g100 -m1 L5_gst.fa L5_gst.fa)  and visualized these alignments using D-GENIES v1.2.0  with minimum identity set to 0.15 and \u2018Strong Precision\u2019 enabled. To validate this repeat structure, we aligned two de novo optical maps created by Bionano using linearized DNA labelled with Nt.BspQI or Nb.BssSI. Single molecules from both maps span the entire region and the predicted restriction pattern provides support for the repeat structure as presented in AaegL5 (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### QTL mapping of DENV vector competence \n  \nIn theory, a good-quality genome assembly is not necessary for QTL mapping procedures, because it relies on a linkage map that can be generated de novo from empirical recombination fractions. This typically involves three steps: (i) marker selection based on the Mendelian segregation ratios, (ii) marker assignment to linkage groups and (iii) marker ordering within each linkage group. However, if a high-quality reference genome assembly is available, the physical position of each marker can be determined and this prior information greatly facilitates steps (ii) and (iii), as shown below. \n\nTo demonstrate the improvement enabled by our new genome, we generated two linkage maps using the same Illumina sequence data that were aligned either to AaegL3 or AaegL5 genome assemblies. Although the initial number of markers was 616 in both cases, the final linkage map was 3.3-fold denser with AaegL5 than with AaegL3, as shown in Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 . The difference in marker density between the two linkage maps is because many markers were filtered out from the AaegL3 data. Because the AaegL3 assembly is highly fragmented (>4,700 scaffolds), the position of each marker within the linkage groups is primarily determined from the recombination fractions. This ordering step is performed by creating a backbone with a subset of informative markers using a two-point algorithm, followed by the positioning of the remaining markers one at a time using a multi-point method. Only markers that are unambiguously positioned are kept in the final linkage map for QTL mapping. We note that AaegL4, which de-duplicated and scaffolded AaegL3 onto chromosomes , would probably yield a similar improvement in mapping resolution. \n\nAnother complication arises for the chromosome 1 in   Ae. aegypti  , because recombination is strongly reduced in the region containing the sex-determining M locus. This leads to the severely biased segregation ratios for markers anchored to this linkage group. In our F  intercross design, the fully sex-linked markers lacked the F  paternal genotype in F  females and segregated in the same manner as a backcross design. No linkage analysis method is readily available to deal with a chromosome that behaves like a mixture of intercross and backcross designs. Therefore, AaegL3-guided linkage analysis and QTL mapping for chromosome 1 were restricted to the fully sex-linked region based on a backcross design. By contrast, AaegL5-guided linkage analysis and QTL mapping for chromosome 1 made use of all markers regardless of their segregation ratios, allowing chromosome-wide coverage. As mentioned in the present manuscript, the only caveat is that our analytical procedure assumes autosomal Mendelian proportions, which may have resulted in over- or underestimation of linkage distances between markers on chromosome 1. The linkage map was iteratively refined by checking for misplaced markers based on visual inspection of the LOD/rf matrix. \n\nUltimately, AaegL5 has a markedly improved QTL mapping resolution over AaegL3. For instance, we mapped the same QTL underlying systemic DENV dissemination at the extremity of chromosome 2 with both AaegL3 and AaegL5. The 1.5 LOD support interval was much larger for the AaegL3-guided linkage map (0\u201350 cM, 74% of the linkage group) than for the AaegL5-guided linkage map (0\u201317 cM, 9% of the linkage group). We present this analysis in Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n#### Mosquito crosses \n  \nA large F  intercross was created from a single mating pair of field-collected F  founders. Wild mosquito eggs were collected in Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand in February 2011 as previously described . In brief, F  eggs were allowed to hatch in filtered tap water and the larvae were reared until the pupae emerged in individual vials.   Ae. aegypti   adults were identified by visual inspection and maintained in an insectary under controlled conditions (28 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C, 75 \u00b1 5% relative humidity and 12:12-h light:dark cycle) with access to 10% sucrose. The F  male and female initiating the cross were chosen from different collection sites to avoid creating a parental pair with siblings from the same wild mother . Their F  offspring were allowed to mass-mate and collectively oviposit to produce the F  progeny (Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 ). A total of 197 females of the F  progeny were used as a mapping population to generate a linkage map and detect QTLs underlying vector competence for DENV. \n\n\n#### Vector competence \n  \nFour low-passage DENV isolates were used to orally challenge the F  females as previously described . In brief, four random groups of females from the F  progeny were experimentally exposed to two virus isolates belonging to DENV serotype 1 (KDH0026A and KDH0030A) and two virus isolates belonging to DENV serotype 3 (KDH0010A and KDH0014A), respectively. All four virus isolates were derived from human serum specimens collected in 2010 from clinically ill patients who were infected with DENV at the Kamphaeng Phet Provincial Hospital . Because the viruses were isolated in the laboratory cell culture, informed consent of the patients was not necessary for the present study. Complete viral genome sequences were previously deposited into GenBank (accession numbers HG316481, HG316582, HG316483, and HG316484) . Phylogenetic analysis assigned the viruses to known viral lineages that were circulating in southeast Asia in the previous years . Each isolate was amplified twice in C6/36 (  Aedes albopictus  ) cell lines (maintained at AFRIMS in Bangkok, Thailand; used only to grow virus, not explicitly authenticated or checked for mycoplasma contamination) before vector competence assays. Four- to seven-day-old F  females were starved for 24 h and offered an infectious blood meal for 30 min. Viral titres in the blood meals ranged from 2.0 \u00d7 10  to 2.5 \u00d7 10  plaque-forming units per ml across all isolates. Fully engorged females were incubated under the conditions described above. Vector competence was scored 14 days after the infectious blood meal according to two conventional phenotypes: (i) midgut infection and (ii) viral dissemination from the midgut. These binary phenotypes were scored based on the presence or absence of infectious particles in body and head homogenates, respectively. Infectious viruses were detected by plaque assay performed in LLC-MK2 (rhesus monkey kidney epithelial) cells as previously described . \n\n\n#### Genotyping \n  \nMosquito gDNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin 96 Tissue Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel). For the F  male, it was necessary to perform whole-genome amplification using the Repli-g Mini kit (Qiagen) to obtain a sufficient amount of DNA. F  parents and females of the F  progeny were genotyped using a modified version of the original double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol , as previously described . The final libraries were spiked with 15% PhiX and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using a 150-cycle paired-end chemistry (Illumina). A previously developed bash script pipeline  was used to process the raw sequence reads. High-quality reads (Phred scores >25) trimmed to the 140-bp length were aligned to the AaegL5 reference genome (July 2017) using Bowtie v.0.12.7 . Parameters for the ungapped alignment included \u22643 mismatches in the seed, suppression of alignments with >1 best reported alignment under a \u2018try-hard\u2019 option. Variant and genotype calling was performed from a catalogue of RAD loci created with the ref_map.pl pipeline in Stacks v.1.19 . Downstream analyses only used high-quality genotypes at informative markers that were homozygous for alternative alleles in the F  parents (for example, AA in the F  male and BB in the F  female), had a sequencing depth \u226510\u00d7 and were present in \u226560% of the mapping population. \n\n\n#### Linkage map \n  \nA comprehensive linkage map based on recombination fractions among RAD markers in the F  generation was constructed using the R package OneMap v.2.0-3 . Every informative autosomal marker is expected to segregate in the F  mapping population at a frequency of 25% for homozygous (AA and BB) genotypes and 50% for heterozygous (AB) genotypes. Autosomal markers that significantly deviated from these Mendelian segregation ratios (  P   < 0.05) were filtered out using a   \u03c7   test. Owing to the presence of a dominant male-determining locus on chromosome 1, fully sex-linked markers on chromosome 1 are expected to segregate in F  females with equal frequencies (50%) of heterozygous (AB) and F  maternal (BB) genotypes, because the F  paternal (AA) genotype only occurs in F  males. As previously reported , strong deviations from the expected Mendelian segregation ratios were observed for a large proportion of markers assigned to chromosome 1 in the female F  progeny. Markers on chromosome 1 were included if they had heterozygous (AB) genotype frequencies inside the 40\u201360% range and F  maternal (BB) genotype frequencies inside the 5%\u201365% range. These arbitrary boundaries for marker selection were largely permissive for partially or fully sex-linked markers on chromosome 1. Owing to a lack of linkage analysis methods that deal with sex-linked markers when only one sex is genotyped, the recombination fractions between all pairs of selected markers were estimated using the rf.2pts function with default parameters for all three chromosomes. The rf.2pts function, which implements the expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm, was used to estimate haplotype frequencies and recombination rates between markers  under the assumption of autosomal Hardy\u2013Weinberg proportions. Owing to this analytical assumption, the estimates of cM distances could be over- or underestimated for markers on chromosome 1. Markers linked with a LOD score \u226511 were assigned to the same linkage group. Linkage groups were assigned to the three distinct   Ae. aegypti   chromosomes based on the physical coordinates of the AaegL5 assembly. Recombination fractions were converted into genetic distances in cM using the Kosambi mapping function . Linkage maps were exported in the R/qtl environment  in which they were corrected for tight double crossing-overs with the calc.errorlod function based on a LOD cut-off threshold of 4. Duplicate markers with identical genotypes were removed with the findDupMarkers function. To remove markers located in highly repetitive sequences, RAD sequences were blasted against the AaegL5 assembly using BLASTn v.2.6.0. Markers with >1 blast hit on chromosomes over their 140-bp length and 100% identity were excluded from linkage analysis. Reported RAD markers were distributed as follows: chromosome 1,   n   = 76; chromosome 2,   n   = 80; chromosome 3,   n   = 99. \n\n\n#### QTL mapping \n  \nThe newly developed linkage map was used to detect and locate QTLs that underlie the DENV vector competence indices described above. Midgut infection was analysed in all F  females whereas viral dissemination was analysed only in midgut-infected females. The four different DENV isolates were included as a covariate to detect QTL\u2013isolate interactions. Single QTL detection was performed in the R/qtl environment  using the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm of the scanone function using a binary trait model. Genome-wide statistical significance was determined by empirical permutation tests, with 1,000 genotype\u2013phenotype permutations of the entire dataset. \n\n\n#### Comparison between AaegL5 and AaegL3 \n  \nTo assess the improvement obtained in AaegL5 to perform QTL mapping, a linkage map was built by aligning RAD markers to the AaegL3 assembly. The AaegL3-guided linkage map was built by assigning markers to chromosomes and by ordering them within each linkage group only on the basis of their recombination fractions. Markers were initially filtered based on their segregation ratios as described above and assigned to the same linkage group based on a LOD score threshold of \u226514. Linkage groups were assigned to the three   Ae. aegypti   chromosomes using supercontigs that were previously mapped to the chromosomes . For each linkage group, a backbone was created with a small subset of informative markers (  n   = 6) using the rf.2pts two-point algorithm of the OneMap package. The remaining markers were positioned one at a time using the OneMap order.seq multi-point method, which compares all maps including the new marker at all possible positions keeping the original linkage map unchanged. This procedure produces both a \u2018safe\u2019 and a \u2018forced\u2019 marker order. The \u2018forced\u2019 marker map indicates the most likely position for each marker, whereas the \u2018safe\u2019 marker map only displays the unambiguously positioned markers. The AaegL3-guided QTL mapping was performed with the \u2018safe\u2019 marker map. Strong bias in Mendelian segregation ratios of markers anchored to chromosome 1 impeded their ordering. Fully sex-linked markers lacked the F  paternal (AA) genotype in F  females, and segregated analogously to a backcross design in which F  AB heterozygotes are backcrossed to F  BB homozygotes. No linkage analysis method is readily available to deal with a chromosome that behaves like a mixture of intercross and backcross designs. Therefore, AaegL3-guided linkage analysis and QTL mapping for chromosome 1 were restricted to the fully sex-linked region based on a backcross design. A new OneMap input file only including markers lacking the F  paternal (AA) genotype was made by setting the population type to \u2018backcross\u2019 instead of \u2018F2 intercross\u2019. Markers were ordered using the order.seq function of the OneMap package as described above. A table summarizing this comparison is available as Extended Data Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n### Mapping insecticide resistance and VGSC \n  \nThe mosquito population Viva Caucel from Yucat\u00e1n State in Southern Mexico (longitude \u221289.71827, latitude 20.99827), was collected in 2011 through the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n. We identified up to 25 larval breeding sites from 3\u20134 city blocks and collected around 1,000 larvae. Larvae were allowed to eclose, and twice a day we aspirated the adults from the cartons, discarding anything other than   Ae. aegypti  . Then, 300\u2013400   Ae. aegypti   were released into a 2-foot (61-cm) cubic cage where they were allowed to mate for up to five days with ad libitum access to sucrose, after which they were blood fed to collect eggs for the next generation. Then, 390 adult mosquitoes were phenotyped for deltamethrin resistance. We exposed groups of 50 mosquitoes (3\u20134 days old) to 3 \u03bcg of deltamethrin-coated bottles for 1 h. After this time, active mosquitoes were transferred to cardboard cups and placed into an incubator (28 \u00b0C and 70% humidity) for 4 h; these mosquitoes were referred to as the resistant group. Immobile mosquitoes were transferred to a second cardboard cup. After 4 h, newly recovered mosquitoes were aspirated, frozen and labelled as recovered; these were excluded from the current study. The mosquitoes that were immobilized and remained inactive at 4 h post-treatment were scored as susceptible. DNA was isolated from individual mosquitoes by the salt extraction method  and resuspended in 150 \u03bcl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). We constructed a total of four gDNA libraries. Two groups were pooled from DNA of 25 individual females that survived 1 h of deltamethrin exposure (resistant replicates 1 and 2). The second set of two libraries was obtained by pooling DNA from 25 females that were immobilized and inactive at 4 h post-treatment (susceptible replicates 1 and 2). Before pooling, DNA from each individual mosquito was quantified using the Quant-IT Pico Green kit (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and around 40 ng from each individual DNA sample (25 individuals per library) was used for a final DNA pool of 1 \u03bcg. Pooled DNA was sheared and fragmented by sonication to obtain fragments between 300 and 500 bp (Covaris). We prepared one library for each of the four DNA pools following the Low Sample protocol from the Illumina TrueSeqDNA PCR-Free Sample preparation guide (Illumina). Because 65% of the   Ae. aegypti   genome consists of repetitive DNA, we performed an exome-capture hybridization to enrich for coding sequences using custom SeqCap EZ Developer probes (NimbleGen, Roche). Probes covered protein-coding sequences (not including untranslated regions) in the AaegL1.3 genebuild using previously specified exonic coordinates . In total, 26.7 Mb of the genome (2%) was targeted for enrichment. TruSeq libraries were hybridized to the probes using the xGenLockDown recommendations (Integrated DNA Technologies). The targeted DNA was eluted and amplified (10\u201315 cycles) before being sequenced on one flow cell of a 100-bp HiSeq Rapid-duo paired-end sequencing run (Illumina) performed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA, USA). \n\nThe raw sequence files (FASTQ) for each pair-ended gDNA library were aligned to a custom reference physical map generated from the assembly AaegL5. Nucleotide counts were loaded into a contingency table with four rows corresponding to \u2018Alive Rep1\u2019, \u2018Alive Rep2\u2019, \u2018Dead Rep1\u2019 and \u2018Dead Rep2\u2019. The numbers of columns (  c  ) corresponded to the number of alternative nucleotides at a SNP locus. The maximum value for   c   is 6, corresponding to A, C, G, T, insert or deletion. Three (2 \u00d7   c  ) contingency tables were subjected to   \u03c7   analyses (  c   \u2212 1 degrees of freedom) to determine whether there are significant (  P   \u2264 0.05) differences between (1) Alive replicates, (2) Dead replicates and (3) Alive versus Dead. If analysis (1) or (2) was significant, then that SNP locus was discarded. Otherwise the third contingency table consisted of two rows corresponding to Alive (sum of replicates 1 and 2), Dead (replicates 1 and 2 summed), and   c   columns. The   \u03c7   value from the (2 \u00d7   c  ) contingency   \u03c7   analysis with (  c   \u2212 1) degrees of freedom was loaded into Excel to calculate the one-tailed probability of the   \u03c7   distribution probability (  P  ). This value was transformed with \u2212log (  P  ). The experiment-wise error rate was then calculated following the method of Benjamini and Hochberg  to lower the number of type I errors (false positives). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this paper. \n\n\n### Code availability \n  \nThe overview of the Hi-C workflow, as well as modifications to 3D-DNA associated with AaegL5, is shared on GitHub at  .

However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist . Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38 , along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X\u00a0chromosome , we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1\u00a0Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes. \n  \nHigh-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing is used to create a new human genome assembly that improves on the coverage and accuracy of the current reference (GRCh38) and includes the gap-free, telomere-to-telomere sequence of the X\u00a0chromosome. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Main \n  \nComplete, telomere-to-telomere reference genome assemblies are necessary to ensure that all genomic variants are discovered and studied. At present, unresolved areas of the human genome are defined by multi-megabase satellite arrays in the pericentromeric regions and the ribosomal DNA arrays on acrocentric short arms, as well as regions enriched in segmental duplications that are greater than hundreds of kilobases in length and that exhibit sequence identity of more than 98% between paralogues. Owing to their absence from the reference, these repeat-rich sequences are often excluded from genetics and genomics studies, which limits the scope of association and functional analyses . Unresolved repeat sequences also result in unintended consequences; for example, paralogous sequence variants incorrectly being called as allelic variants , and the contamination of bacterial gene databases . Completion of the entire human genome is expected to contribute to our understanding of chromosome function , human disease  and genomic variation, which will improve technologies in biomedicine that use short-read mapping to a reference genome (for example, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) , chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP\u2013seq)  and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC\u2013seq) ). \n\nThe fundamental challenge of reconstructing a genome from many comparatively short sequencing reads\u2014a process known as genome assembly\u2014is distinguishing the repeated sequences from one another . Resolving such repeats relies on sequencing reads that are long enough to span the entire repeat or accurate enough to distinguish each repeat copy on the basis of unique variants . The difficulty of the assembly problem and limits of past technologies are highlighted by the fact that the human genome remains unfinished 20 years after its initial release in 2001 . The first human reference genome released by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI Build 28) was highly fragmented, with half of the genome contained in continuous sequences (contigs) of 500\u00a0kb or more (NG50). Efforts to finish the genome , together with the stewardship of the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) , greatly increased the continuity of the reference to an NG50 contig length of 56\u00a0Mb in the most recent release\u2014GRCh38\u2014but the most repetitive regions of the genome remain unsolved and no chromosome is completely represented telomere to telomere. A de novo assembly of ultra-long (greater than 100\u00a0kb) nanopore reads showed promising assembly continuity in the most difficult regions , but this proof-of-concept project sequenced the genome to only 5\u00d7 depth of coverage and failed to assemble the largest human genomic repeats. Previous modelling on the basis of the size and distribution of large repeats in the human genome predicted that an assembly of 30\u00d7 ultra-long reads would approach the continuity of the human reference . Therefore, we hypothesized that high-coverage ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing would enable the first complete assembly of human chromosomes. \n\nTo circumvent the complexity of assembling both haplotypes of a diploid genome, we selected the effectively haploid CHM13hTERT cell line for sequencing (hereafter, CHM13) . This cell line was derived from a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) with a 46,XX karyotype. The genomes of such uterine moles originate from a single sperm that has undergone post-meiotic chromosomal duplication; these genomes are, therefore, uniformly homozygous for one set of alleles. CHM13 has previously been used to patch gaps in the human reference , benchmark genome assemblers and diploid variant callers , and investigate human segmental duplications . Karyotyping of the CHM13 line confirmed a stable 46,XX karyotype, with no observable chromosomal anomalies (Extended Data Fig.  , Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Maximum likelihood admixture analysis  confidently assigns the majority of haplotypes to a European origin, with the potential of some Asian or Amerindian admixture (Extended Data Fig.  ,\u00a0Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## Highly continuous whole-genome assembly \n  \nHigh-molecular-weight DNA from CHM13 cells was extracted and prepared for nanopore sequencing using a previously described ultra-long-read protocol . In total, we sequenced 98 MinION flow cells for a total of 155\u00a0Gb (50\u00d7 coverage, 1.6\u00a0Gb per flow cell, Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Half of all sequenced bases were contained in reads of 70\u00a0kb or longer (78\u00a0Gb, 25\u00d7 genome coverage) and the longest validated read was 1.04\u00a0Mb. Once we had collected sufficient sequencing coverage for de novo assembly, we combined 39\u00d7 coverage of the ultra-long reads with 70\u00d7 coverage of previously generated PacBio data and assembled the CHM13 genome using Canu . Canu selected the longest 30\u00d7-coverage ultra-long and 7\u00d7-coverage PacBio reads for correction and assembly. This initial assembly totalled 2.90\u00a0Gb, with half of the genome contained in continuous sequences (contigs) of length 75\u00a0Mb or greater (NG50), which exceeds the continuity of the GRCh38 reference genome (75 versus 56\u00a0Mb for NG50). The assembly was then iteratively polished by a series of sequencing technologies in order of longest to shortest read lengths: Nanopore, PacBio and linked-read Illumina. Consensus accuracy improved from 99.46% for the initial assembly to 99.67% after Nanopore polishing and 99.99% after PacBio polishing. Illumina data were used only\u00a0to correct small insertion and deletion errors in uniquely mappable regions of the genome, which had a marginal effect on the average accuracy but reduced the number of frameshifted genes. Putative misassemblies were identified through analysis of the Illumina linked-read barcodes (10X Genomics) and optical mapping (Bionano Genomics) data not used in the initial assembly. The initial contigs were broken at regions of low mapping coverage and the corrected contigs were then ordered and oriented relative to one another using the optical map. Over 90% of six chromosomes are represented in two contigs and ten are represented by two scaffolds (Fig.  ).    CHM13 whole-genome assembly and validation.  \n a  , Gapless contigs are illustrated as blue and orange bars next to the chromosome ideograms (highlighting contig breaks). Several chromosomes are broken only in centromeric regions. Large gaps between contigs (for example, middle of chr1) indicate sites of large heterochromatic blocks (arrays of human satellite 2 and 3 in yellow) or ribosomal DNA arrays with no GRCh38 sequence. Centromeric satellite arrays that are expected to be similar in sequence between non-homologous chromosomes are indicated: chr1, chr5 and chr19 (green); chr4 and chr9 (light blue); chr5 and chr19 (pink); chr13 and chr21 (red); and chr14 and chr22 (purple).   b  , The X\u00a0chromosome was selected for manual assembly, and was initially broken at three locations: the centromere (artificially collapsed in the assembly), a large segmental duplication (DMRTC1B, 120\u00a0kb), and a second segmental duplication with a paralogue on chromosome 2 (134\u00a0kb). Gaps in the GRCh38 reference (black) and known segmental duplications (red; paralogous to Y, pink) are annotated. Repeats larger than 100\u00a0kb are named with the expected size (kb) (blue, tandem repeats; red, segmental duplications).   c  , Misassembly of the GAGE locus identified by the optical map (top), and corrected version (bottom) showing the final assembly of 19 (9.5\u00a0kb) full-length repeat units and two partial repeats.   d  , Quality of the GAGE locus before and after polishing using unique (single-copy) markers to place long reads. Dots indicate coverage depth (number of mapped sequencing reads overlapping each base) of the primary (black) and secondary (red) alleles recovered from mapped PacBio HiFi reads (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Because the CHM13 genome is effectively haploid, regions of low coverage or increased secondary allele frequency indicate low-quality regions or potential repeat collapses. Marker-assisted polishing markedly improved allele uniformity across the entire GAGE locus. \n  \n\nThe final assembly consists of 2.94\u00a0Gb in 448 contigs with a contig NG50 of 70\u00a0Mb. A total of 98 scaffolds (173 contigs) were unambiguously assigned to a reference chromosome, representing 98% of the assembled bases. We estimated the median consensus accuracy of this whole-genome assembly to be at least 99.99%, on the basis of both previously finished BAC sequences  and mapped Illumina linked reads (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Although similar to the GRCh38 ungapped length (2.95\u00a0Gb), our assembly size is shorter than the estimated human genome size of 3.2\u00a0Gb. We estimate approximately 170\u00a0Mb of collapsed bases using the Segment Duplication Assembler (SDA) method . Compared to other recent assemblies, we resolved a greater fraction of the 341 CHM13 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences that have previously been isolated and finished from segmentally duplicated and other difficult-to-assemble regions of the genome  (Table  , Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Comparative annotation of our whole-genome assembly also shows a higher agreement of mapped transcripts than previous assemblies and only a slightly increased rate of potential frameshifts compared to GRCh38 . Of the 19,618 protein-coding genes annotated in the CHM13 de novo assembly, just 170 (0.86%) contain a predicted frameshift, or, if measured by transcripts, only 334 of 83,332 transcripts (0.40%) contain a predicted frameshift (Supplementary Table  ). When used as a reference sequence for calling structural variants in other genomes, CHM13 reports an even balance of insertion and deletion calls (Extended Data Fig.  , Supplementary Note\u00a0 ), as expected, whereas GRCh38 demonstrates a deletion bias, as previously reported . Compared to other long-read assemblies, GRCh38 calls twice as many inversions as CHM13\u00a0(mean 26 versus 13 inversions per genome), suggesting that some misoriented sequences remain in the current human reference (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Of these inversions, 19 are specific to GRCh38 and not found in 5 recently assembled long-read human genomes (Supplementary Table  ). We identified telomeric sequences within the assembly and the reads (Extended Data Fig.  ,\u00a0Supplementary Note\u00a0 ), which were highly concordant in telomere size, and our assembly includes 41 of 46 expected telomeres at contig ends. Thus, in terms of continuity, completeness and correctness, our CHM13 assembly exceeds all previous human de novo assemblies\u2014including the current human reference genome, by some quality metrics (Supplementary Table  ).   \nAssembly statistics for CHM13 and the human reference sorted by continuity \n  \nGRCh38 is expected to have a lower identity to BACs derived from CHM13 as it represents a different human genome. \n\nPrimary Technology: sequencing technology used for contig assembly. The PacBio CLR assembly was additionally polished using Illumina linked reads. The Nanopore ultra-long assembly was polished with the PacBio CLR and Illumina linked reads. GRCh38 is primarily based on Sanger-sequenced BACs, but has been continually curated and patched since the completion of the human genome project. Assembly: assembler used and reference to the published assembly. Size: sum of bases in the assembly in Gb including N-bases. GRCh38 assembly size includes 110\u00a0Mb of alternative (ALT) sequences. No. of contigs: total number of contigs in the assembly; scaffolds were split at three consecutive N-bases to obtain contigs. NG50: half of the 3.09-Gb human genome size contained in contigs of this length or greater in Mb. Supernova NG50 statistics were identical between the two reported pseudo-haplotypes. BACs resolved (%): percentage of 341 \u2018challenging\u2019 CHM13 BACs found intact in the assembly. BACs unresolved by the best CHM13 assembly either map across multiple contigs or map to a single contig with large structural variation, indicating an error in either the BAC or whole-genome assembly. BACs %idy all: median alignment accuracy versus all validation BACs. BACs %idy uni: median alignment accuracy versus the 31 validation BACs that occur outside of segmental duplications (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n  \n\n\n## A finished human X\u00a0chromosome \n  \nUsing this whole-genome assembly as a basis, we selected the X\u00a0chromosome for manual finishing and validation, owing to its high continuity in the initial assembly; distinctive and well-characterized centromeric alpha satellite array ; unique behaviour during development ; and disproportionate involvement in Mendelian disease . The de novo assembly of the X\u00a0chromosome was broken in three places: at the centromere and at two near-identical segmental duplications of greater than 100\u00a0kb (Fig.  ). The two segmental duplications breaking the assembly were manually resolved by identifying ultra-long reads that completely spanned the repeats and were uniquely anchored on either side, thus allowing for a confident placement in the assembly. Improvements of assembly quality for these difficult regions were evaluated by mapping an orthogonal set of PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads generated from CHM13  and assessing read depth over informative single-nucleotide-variant differences (Methods). In addition, experimental validation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) confirmed that the now-complete assembly correctly represents the tandem repeats of the CHM13 genome, including seven CT47 genes (7.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.)), six CT45 genes (6.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38), 19 complete and two partial GAGE genes (19.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.745), 55 DXZ4 repeats (55.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.09) and a 3.1-Mb centromeric DXZ1 array (1,408\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040.69 2,057-bp repeats) (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\nPrevious high-resolution studies of the haploid centromeric satellite array on the X\u00a0chromosome (DXZ1) have informed our present genomic models of human centromere organization . The X\u00a0centromere, as with all normal human centromeres, is defined at the sequence level by alpha satellite DNA\u2014an AT-rich (around 171\u00a0bp) tandem repeat, or \u2018monomer\u2019 . The canonical repeat of the DXZ1 array is defined by 12 divergent monomers that are ordered to form a larger repeating unit of around 2\u00a0kb, which is known as a \u2018higher-order repeat\u2019 (HOR) . The HORs are tandemly arranged into a large, multi-megabase-sized satellite array (that is, 2.2\u20133.7\u00a0Mb; mean of 3,010 kb (s.d.\u00a0=\u00a0429,   n  \u00a0=\u00a049))  with limited nucleotide differences between repeat copies . These previous assessments were used to guide our evaluation of the DXZ1 assembly, and offered established experimental methods to evaluate the structure of the DXZ1 array  (Extended Data Fig.  ). To assemble the X\u00a0centromere, we constructed a catalogue of structural and single-nucleotide variants within the canonical DXZ1 repeat unit (around 2\u00a0kb)  and used these variants as signposts  to uniquely tile ultra-long reads across the entire centromeric satellite array (DXZ1) (Extended Data Fig.  ), as was previously done for the Y\u00a0centromere . The DXZ1 array was estimated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) Southern blotting to be in the range of approximately 2.8\u20133.1\u00a0Mb (Fig.  , Extended Data Fig.  ), in which the resulting restriction profiles were in agreement with the structure of the predicted array assembly (Fig.  ). Copy-number estimates of the DXZ1 repeat by ddPCR were benchmarked against a panel of previously sized arrays by PFGE Southern blotting, and provided further support for an array of around 2.8\u00a0Mb (1,408\u00a0\u00b1\u00a081.38) copies of the canonical 2,057-kb repeat) (Fig.  , Supplementary Table  , Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Furthermore, direct comparisons of DXZ1 structural-variant frequency with PacBio HiFi data were highly concordant  (Fig.  , Extended Data Fig.  ).    Validated structure of the 3.1-MB CHM13 X-centromere array.  \n a  , Top, the array, with approximately\u00a02-kb repeat units labelled by vertical bands (grey is the canonical unit; coloured are structural variants). A single LINE/L1Hs insertion in the array is marked by an arrowhead. Bottom, a predicted restriction map for enzyme BglI, with dashed lines indicating regions outside of the DXZ1 array. A minimum tiling path was reconstructed for illustration purposes and was not the mechanism for initial assembly (Extended Data Fig.  ).   b  , Experimental PFGE Southern blotting for a BglI digest in duplicate (band sizing indicated by triangles; BglI, 2.87\u00a0Mb\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16), that matches the in silico predicted band patterns (  a  ) for the CHM13 array (experimentally repeated six times with similar results).   c  , Array size estimates were provided using ddPCR (performed in triplicate; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.) optimized against PFGE Southern blots (HAP1,   n  \u00a0=\u00a06; T6012,   n  \u00a0=\u00a04; LT690,   n  \u00a0=\u00a07; CHM13,   n  \u00a0=\u00a013).   d  , Catalogue of 33 DXZ1 structural variants identified relative to the 2,057-bp canonical repeat unit (grey), along with the number of instances observed, frequency in the array, number of alpha satellite monomers and size. INS, insertion (that is, the 8.1-kb inserted LINE/L1Hs).   e  , Coverage depth of mapped (grey) and uniquely anchored (black) nanopore reads to the DXZ1 array. Marker-assisted polishing (bottom) improves coverage uniformity versus the unpolished (top) assembly. Single-copy, unique markers are shown as vertical green bands, with a decreased but non-zero density across the array.   f  , Distributions show the spacing between adjacent unique markers on chromosome X and DXZ1. On average, unique markers are found every 66 bases on chromosome X, but only every 2.3\u00a0kb in DXZ1, with the longest gap between any two adjacent markers being 42\u00a0kb. \n  \n\nCurrent long-read assemblies require rigorous consensus polishing to achieve maximum base call accuracy . Given the placement of each read in the assembly, these polishing tools statistically model the underlying signal data to make accurate predictions for each sequenced base. Key to this process is the correct placement of each read that will contribute to the polishing. Owing to ambiguous read mappings, our initial polishing attempts decreased the assembly quality within the largest X-chromosome repeats (Extended Data Fig.  ). To overcome this, we analysed Illumina sequencing data to catalogue short (21\u00a0bp), unique (single-copy) sequences that are present on the CHM13 X\u00a0chromosome (Extended Data Fig.  ). Even within the largest repeat arrays, such as DXZ1, there was enough variation between repeat copies to induce unique 21-mer markers at semi-regular intervals (Fig.  , Extended Data Fig.  ). These markers were used to inform the correct placement of long X-chromosome reads within the assembly (Methods). Two rounds of iterative polishing were performed for each technology; first with Oxford Nanopore, then PacBio and finally Illumina linked reads , and the consensus accuracy increased after each round. The Illumina data were too short to confidently anchor using unique markers and were only used to polish the unique regions for which mappings were unambiguous. This careful polishing process proved critical for accurately finishing X-chromosome repeats that exceeded both Nanopore and PacBio read lengths. \n\nOur manually finished X-chromosome assembly is complete, gapless and estimated to be 99.991% accurate on the basis of X-specific BACs or 99.995% accurate on the basis of the mapped Illumina data. There is unambiguous support for 99.9% of the assembly bases (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ), which meets the original Bermuda Standards for finished genomic sequences . Accuracy is predicted to be slightly lower (median identity 99.3%) across the largest repeats, such as the DXZ1 satellite array, but this is difficult to measure owing to a lack of BAC clones from these regions. Mapped long-read and optical-mapping data show uniform coverage across the completed X\u00a0chromosome and no evidence of structural errors in regions that could be mapped (Fig.  , Extended Data Fig.  ,\u00a0Supplementary Note\u00a0 ), and Strand-seq data confirm the absence of any inversion errors (Extended Data Fig.  ). Single-nucleotide-variant calling through long-read mapping revealed that the initial assembly quality was lower in the large, tandemly repeated GAGE and CT47 gene families, but these issues were resolved by polishing and validated through ultra-long-read mapping and optical mapping (Fig.  , Extended Data Fig.  ,\u00a0Supplementary Table  ). Mapped long-read coverage across the DXZ1 array shows uniform depth of coverage and high accuracy, as measured by TandemQUAST  (Fig.  , Extended Data Figs.  j,  ). We identified all HiFi reads that match the DXZ1 repeat. All reads\u2014except one with a large, probably erroneous homopolymer\u2014were explained by our reconstruction, confirming the completeness of the DXZ1 array. Mapped coverage across the entire X\u00a0chromosome was uniform, with coverage of only a small percentage of bases being more than three standard deviations from the mean (0.44% Nanopore, 0.77% PacBio continuous long reads (CLR), 2.4% HiFi). Low-coverage HiFi regions were enriched for low unique-marker density, making them difficult to assign owing to their relatively short length (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Furthermore, variant calling identified no high-frequency variants from the HiFi or CLR data and only low-complexity variants from the ultra-long-read data, which are likely to represent errors in the ultra-long-read data rather than true assembly error. Our complete telomere-to-telomere version of the X\u00a0chromosome fully resolved 29 reference gaps , totalling 1,147,861 bp of previous ambiguous bases (N-bases). \n\n\n## Chromosome-wide DNA methylation maps \n  \nNanopore sequencing is sensitive to methylated bases, as revealed by modulation in the raw electrical signal . Precisely anchored ultra-long reads provide a new method to profile patterns of methylation over repetitive regions that are often difficult to detect with short-read sequencing. The X\u00a0chromosome has many epigenomic features that are unique in the human genome. X-chromosome inactivation, in which one of the female X\u00a0chromosomes is silenced early in development and remains inactive in somatic tissues, is expected to provide a unique methylation profile chromosome-wide. In agreement with previous studies , we observe decreased methylation across the majority of the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) located at both tips of the X-chromosome arms (Fig.  ). The inactive X\u00a0chromosome also adopts an unusual spatial conformation and, consistent with previous studies , CHM13 chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data support two large superdomains partitioned at the macrosatellite repeat DXZ4 (Extended Data Fig.  ). On closer analysis of the DXZ4 array we found distinct bands of methylation (Fig.  ), with hypomethylation observed at the distal edge, which is generally concordant with previously described chromatin structure . Notably, we also identified a region of decreased methylation within the DXZ1 centromeric array (around 60\u00a0kb, chrX: 59,217,708\u201359,279,205) (Fig.  ). To test whether this finding was specific to the X\u00a0array or also found at other centromeric satellites, we manually assembled a centromeric array of around 2.02\u00a0Mb on chromosome 8 (D8Z2)  and used the same unique-marker mapping strategy to confidently anchor long reads across the array (G.A.L. et al., manuscript in preparation). In doing so, we identified another hypomethylated region within the D8Z2 array, similar to our observation on the DXZ1 array (Extended Data Fig.  )\u2014which further demonstrates the capability of our ultra-long-read mapping strategy to provide base-level chromosome-wide DNA methylation maps. Studies will be needed to validate this finding for additional chromosomes and samples, and to evaluate the potential importance, if any, of these methylation patterns.    Chromosome-wide analysis of CpG methylation.  \nMethylation estimates were calculated by smoothing methylation frequency data with a window size of 500 nucleotides. Coverage depth and high quality methylation calls (|log-likelihood|\u00a0>\u00a02.5) for PAR1, DXZ1 and DXZ4 are shown as insets. Only reads with a confident unique anchor mapping and the presence of at least one high-quality methylation call were considered.   a  , Nanopore coverage and methylation calls for pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of chromosome X (1,563\u20132,600,000).

Although we have focused here on finishing the X\u00a0chromosome, our whole-genome assembly has reconstructed several other chromosomes with only a few remaining gaps, and can serve as the basis for completing additional chromosomes. However, there are still a number of challenges to be overcome. For example, applying these approaches to diploid samples will require phasing the underlying haplotypes to avoid mixing regions of complex structural variation. Our preliminary analysis of other chromosomes shows that regions of duplication and centromeric satellites larger than that of the X\u00a0chromosome will require the development of additional methods . This is especially true of the acrocentric human chromosomes, the massive satellite arrays and segmental duplications of which have yet to be resolved at the sequence level. In addition, Fig.   highlights the centromeric satellite arrays that are expected to be similar in sequence between non-homologous chromosomes. Arrays such as these will need to be phased both between and within chromosomes. \n\nFinishing the human genome will proceed as these remaining challenges are met, beginning with the comparatively easier-to-assemble chromosomes (for example, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18\u00a0and 20), and eventually concluding with the chromosomes that contain large blocks of classical human satellites (1, 9\u00a0and 16) and the acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21\u00a0and 22). In the near term, reference gaps closed in the CHM13 genome will be integrated into GRCh38 using the existing \u2018patch\u2019 infrastructure of the GRC. Once all CHM13 chromosomes are completed, we plan to provide these to the GRC as the basis for a new, entirely gapless, reference genome release, which would probably be a mosaic of the current reference with CHM13 sequence in the most difficult regions. Efforts to finally complete the GRC human reference genome will help to advance the necessary technology towards our ultimate goal of complete, telomere-to-telomere, diploid assemblies for all human genomes. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data reporting \n  \nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. \n\n\n### Cell culture \n  \nCells from the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 were originally cultured from one case of a hydatidiform mole at Magee-Womens Hospital (Pittsburgh) as part of a research study that occurred in the early 2000s (IRB MWH-20-054). At that time, the CHM13 cells were cultured, karyotyped using Q\u00a0banding, and subsequently immortalized using human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). For this study, cryopreserved CHM13 cells were thawed and cultured in complete AmnioMax C-100 Basal Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and grown in a humidity-controlled environment at 37\u2009\u00b0C, with 95% O  and 5% CO . Fresh medium was exchanged every three days and all cells used for this study did not exceed passage 10. Cells have been authenticated and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. \n\n\n### Karyotyping \n  \nMetaphase slide preparations were made from the human hydatidiform mole cell line CHM13, and prepared by a standard air-drying technique as previously described . DAPI banding techniques were performed to identify structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in the karyotypes according to the ISCN . Karyotypes were analysed using a Zeiss M2 fluorescence microscope and Applied Spectral Imaging software (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing \n  \nHigh-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010  CHM13 cells using a modified Sambrook and Russell protocol . Libraries were constructed using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies with 15 \u03bcg of DNA. The initial reaction was typically divided into thirds for loading and FRA buffer (104 mM Tris pH 8.0, 233 mM NaCl) was added to bring the volume to 21 ul. These reactions were incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 48 h to allow the buffers to equilibrate before loading. Most sequencing was performed on the Nanopore GridION with FLO-MIN106 or FLO-MIN106D R9 flow cells, with the exception of one Flongle flow cell used for testing. Sequencing reads used in the initial assembly were first base-called on the sequencing instrument. After all data were collected, the reads were base-called again using the more recent Guppy algorithm (v.2.3.1 with the \u2018flip-flop\u2019 model enabled). \n\nA 10X Genomics linked-read genomic library was prepared from 1 ng of high-molecular-weight genomic DNA using a 10X Genomics Chromium device and Chromium Reagent Kit v.2 according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 DNA sequencer on an S4 flow cell, generating 586 million paired-end 151-base reads. The raw data were processed using RTA 3.3.3 and bwa 0.7.12 . The resulting molecule size was calculated to be 130.6 kb from a Supernova  assembly. \n\nDNA was prepared using the \u2018Bionano Prep Cell Culture DNA Isolation Protocol\u2019. After cells were collected, they were put through a number of washes before embedding in agarose. A proteinase K digestion was performed, followed by additional washes and agarose digestion. The DNA was assessed for quantity and quality using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit and CHEF gel. A 750-ng aliquot of DNA was labelled and stained following the Bionano Prep Direct Label and Stain (DLS) protocol. Once stained, the DNA was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit and run on the Saphyr chip. \n\nHi-C libraries were generated, in replicate, by Arima Genomics using four restriction enzymes. After the modified chromatin digestion, digested ends were labelled, proximally ligated, and then proximally ligated DNA was purified. After the Arima-HiC protocol, Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries were prepared by first shearing then size-selecting DNA fragments using SPRI beads. The size-selected fragments containing ligation junctions were enriched using Enrichment Beads provided in the Arima-HiC kit, and converted into Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries using the Swift Accel-NGS 2S Plus kit (P/N: 21024) reagents. After adaptor ligation, DNA was PCR-amplified and purified using SPRI beads. The purified DNA underwent standard quality control (qPCR and Bioanalyzer) and was sequenced on the HiSeq X following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. \n\n\n### Nanopore and PacBio whole-genome assembly \n  \nCanu v.1.7.1  was run with all rel1 Oxford Nanopore data (on-instrument basecaller, rel1) generated on or before 7 November 2018 (totalling 39\u00d7 coverage) and PacBio sequences (Sequence Read Archive (SRA): PRJNA269593) generated in 2014 and 2015 (totalling 70\u00d7 coverage) . Several chromosomes in the assembly are broken only at centromeric regions (for example, chr10, chr12, chr18 and so on) (Fig.  ). Despite apparent continuity across several centromeres, (for example, chr8, chr11\u00a0and chrX), the assembler reported many fewer than the expected number of repeat copies. \n\n\n### Manual gap closure \n  \nGaps on the X\u00a0chromosome were closed by mapping all reads against the assembly and manually identifying reads joining contigs that were not included in the automated Canu assembly. This generated an initial candidate chromosome assembly, with the exception of the centromere. Four regions of the candidate assembly were found to be structurally inconsistent with the Bionano optical map and were corrected by manually selecting reads from those regions and locally reassembling with Canu  and Flye v.2.4 . Low-coverage long reads that confidently spanned the entire repeat region were used to guide and evaluate the final assembly where available. Evaluation of copy number and repeat organization between the reassembled version and spanning reads was performed using HMMER (v.3)  trained on a specific tandem repeat unit, and the reported structures were manually compared. Default parameters for Minimap2  resulted in uneven coverage and polishing accuracy over tandemly repeated sequences. This was successfully addressed by increasing the Minimap2 -r parameter from 500 to 10,000 and increasing the maximum number of reported secondary alignments (-N) from 5 to 50. Final evaluation of repeat base-level quality was determined by mapping of PacBio datasets (CLR and HiFi) (Extended Data Fig.  , Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\nThe alpha satellite array in the X\u00a0centromere, owing to its availability as a haploid array in male genomes, is one of the best-studied centromeric regions at the genomic level, with a well-defined 2-kb repeat unit , physical and genetic maps  and an expected range of array lengths . We initially generated a database of alpha satellite containing ultra-long reads, by labelling those reads with at least one complete consensus sequence  of a 171-bp canonical repeat in both orientations, as previously described . Reads containing alpha in the reverse orientation were reverse-complemented, and screened with HMMER (v.3) using a 2,057-bp DXZ1 repeat unit. We then used run-length encoding in which runs of the 2,057-bp canonical repeat (defined as any repeat in the range of minimum: 1,957 bp, maximum: 2,157 bp) were stored as a single data value and count, rather than the original run. This allowed us to redefine all reads as a series of variants, or repeats, that differ in size or structure from the expected canonical repeat unit, with a defined spacing in between. Identified CHM13 DXZ1 structural variants in the ultra-long-read data were compared to a library of previously characterized rearrangements in published PacBio (CLR  and HiFi ) using Alpha-CENTAURI, as described . Output annotation of structural variants and canonical DXZ1 spacing for each read were manually clustered to generate six initial contigs, two of which are known to anchor into the adjacent Xp or Xq. To define the order and overlap between contigs, we identified all 21-mers that had an exact match within the high-quality DXZ1 array data obtained from CRISPR\u2013Cas9 Duplex-seq (CRISPR-DS) targeted resequencing  (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). Overlap between the two or more 21-mers with equal spacing guided the organization of the assembly. Orthogonal validation of the spacing between contigs (and contig structure) was supported with additional ultra-long read coverage, providing high-confidence in repeat unit counts for all but three regions. \n\n\n### Chromosome X long-read polishing \n  \nWe used a novel mapping pipeline to place reads within repeats using unique markers. Length   k   substrings (  k  -mers) were collected from the Illumina linked reads, after trimming off the barcodes (the first 23 bases of the first read in a pair). The read was placed in the location of the assembly that had the most unique markers in common with the read. Alignments were further filtered to exclude short and low-identity alignments. This process was repeated after each polishing round, with new unique markers and alignments recomputed after each round. Polishing proceeded with one round of Racon followed by two rounds of Nanopolish and two rounds of Arrow. Post-polishing, all previously flagged low-quality loci showed substantial improvement, with the exception of 139\u2013140.3 which still had a coverage drop and was replaced with an alternate patch assembly generated by Canu using PacBio HiFi data. \n\n\n### Whole-genome long-read polishing \n  \nThe rest of the whole-genome assembly was polished similarly to the X\u00a0chromosome, but without the use of unique   k  -mer anchoring. Instead, two rounds of Nanopolish, followed by two rounds of Arrow, were run using the above parameters, which rely on the mapping quality and length and identity thresholds to determine the best placements of the long reads. As no concerted effort was made to correctly assemble the large satellite arrays on chromosomes other than the X\u00a0chromosome, this default polishing method was deemed sufficient for the remainder of the genome. However, future efforts to complete these remaining chromosomes are expected to benefit from the unique   k  -mer anchoring mapping approach. \n\n\n### Whole-genome short-read polishing \n  \nThe Illumina linked reads were used for a final polishing of the whole assembly, including the X\u00a0chromosome, but using only unambiguous mappings and correcting only small insertion and deletion errors (Supplementary Note\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Methylation analysis \n  \nTo measure CpG methylation in nanopore data we used Nanopolish . Nanopolish uses a Hidden Markov model on the nanopore current signal to distinguish 5-methylcytosine from unmethylated cytosine. The methylation caller generates a log-likelihood value for the ratio of probability of methylated to unmethylated CGs at a specific   k  -mer. We next filtered methylation calls using the nanopore_methylation_utilities tool ( ), which uses a log-likelihood ratio of 2.5 as a threshold for calling methylation . CpG sites with log-likelihood ratios greater than 2.5 (methylated) or less than \u22122.5 (unmethylated) are considered high quality and included in the analysis. Reads that did not have any high-quality CpG sites were excluded from the subsequent methylation analysis. Figure   shows the coverage of reads with at least one high quality CpG site. Nanopore_methylation_utilities integrates methylation information into the alignment BAM file for viewing in the bisulfite mode in IGV  and also creates Bismark-style files which we then analysed with the R Bioconductor package BSseq (v.1.20.0) . We used the BSmooth algorithm  within the BSseq package for smoothing the data to estimate the methylation level at specific regions of interest. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this paper. \n\n\n\n## Online content \n  \nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41586-020-2547-7. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7484160, "text_md5": "ac045314013719e479b80474313a9b1e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 1104], "journal": [1105, 1111], "publication_year": [1113, 1117], "title": [1128, 1190], "keywords": [1204, 1265], "abstract": [1278, 2895], "body": [2904, 42411]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32663838, "doi": "10.1038/s41586-020-2547-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7484160", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7484160"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7484160\">7484160</a>", "list_title": "PMC7484160  Telomere-to-telomere assembly of a complete human X chromosome"}

DFUs are characterized by a deregulated immune response with decreased neutrophils due to loss of the transcription factor, FOXM1. Diabetes primes neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), contributing to tissue damage and impaired healing. However, the role of FOXM1 in priming diabetic neutrophils to undergo NET formation remains unknown. Here, we found that FOXM1 regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in neutrophils and inhibition of FOXM1 results in increased ROS leading to NET formation. Next generation sequencing revealed that TREM1 promoted the recruitment of FOXM1  neutrophils and reversed effects of diabetes and promoted wound healing   in\u2009vivo  . Moreover, we found that TREM1 expression correlated with clinical healing outcomes of DFUs, indicating TREM1 may serve as a useful biomarker or a potential therapeutic target. Our findings highlight the clinical relevance of TREM1, and indicates FOXM1 pathway as a novel regulator of NET formation during diabetic wound healing, revealing new therapeutic strategies to promote healing in DFUs. \n  \nThe FOXM1 transcription factor modulates NETs by regulating ROS during diabetic wound healing. TREM1 contributes to the clinical healing outcome and promotes FOXM1  neutrophil recruitment to enhance diabetic wound healing.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDiabetes Mellitus is associated with numerous debilitating comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy (Brem & Tomic\u2010Canic,\u2009 ; Alavi   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). A major complication of diabetes is the development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), nonhealing ulcerative wounds present on the lower extremities that incur devastating clinical outcomes (Brem & Tomic\u2010Canic,\u2009 ; Alavi   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Approximately one in four diabetic patients will develop a DFU in their lifetime (Armstrong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Many DFUs necessitate lower limb amputation, which has a 5\u2010year survival rate of 40\u201350% (Armstrong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Soo   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Despite the critical need for effective therapies to heal DFUs and reduce associated amputation rates, no new therapies have been FDA approved for efficacy since 1998. The pathogenesis of DFUs involves many intrinsic factors such as neuropathy, vasculopathy, ischemia, infection, fibrosis, and immune dysfunction (Alavi   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Armstrong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Ramirez   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). In particular, the immune response in DFUs is permissive to a hyperproliferative and nonmigratory epidermis, biofilm formation, and infection (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Ramirez   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). \n\nAcute wound healing is a highly organized process that involves the sequential yet overlapping action of multiple process including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling (Pastar   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Stone   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ,  ; Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Keratinocytes, macrophages, platelets, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory immunocytes are key cellular effectors of cutaneous healing and have stringently regulated roles in each healing stage (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Koh & DiPietro,\u2009 ). Studies comparing wounding in the oral mucosa, in which wound closure is rapid and occurs without scarring, with cutaneous wounding emphasize the importance of controlled inflammation to achieve optimal wound closure (Chen   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Turabelidze   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Iglesias\u2010Bartolome   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Uchiyama   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). The proinflammatory cellular infiltrate of early stage acute wound healing is composed primarily of neutrophils that kill invading microbes, and macrophages that clear apoptotic neutrophils and restore tissue integrity for wound closure (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ,  ; Wilgus   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Williams   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Neutrophils use several antimicrobial mechanisms, including phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and exocytosis of antimicrobial peptides from membrane\u2010bound granules (degranulation; Kaplan & Radic,\u2009 ; Ley   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). An additional mechanism, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is a distinct cell death program in which neutrophils extrude web\u2010like structures composed of decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial peptides and enzymes (neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, myeloperoxidase, and others; Brinkmann   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Kaplan & Radic,\u2009 ; Sollberger   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Deregulated NET formation has been proposed to contribute to an array of inflammatory conditions including autoimmunity, thrombosis, malignancy, and sepsis (Fuchs   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Amulic   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Gupta & Kaplan,\u2009 ; Jorch & Kubes,\u2009 ; Byrd   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Enhanced NET release and impaired NET clearance in the blood and tissues of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are implicated in the progression of vascular damage and atherosclerosis as well as in lupus nephritis (Hakkim   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Mistry   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; O'Neil   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Similarly, unregulated NET formation contributes to an impaired healing response in diabetic wound healing (Wong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Fadini   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Upon wounding, diabetic mice produce higher levels of NETs that is rescued by treatment with DNAse\u20101 (Wong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). An excess of other NET components, including neutrophil elastase and proteinase\u20103, were found to be predictive indicators of poor healing outcome in patients with diabetes (Fadini   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). However, the priming of neutrophils to enhance NET formation during diabetic wound healing is poorly understood. \n\nForkhead Box\u2009M1 (FOXM1) is a transcriptional activator of proliferation in an array of cell types and is overexpressed in many cancers (Liao   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). FOXM1 is also involved in the acute wound resolution of hyperoxic lung injury (Xia   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ), as well as hepatocyte proliferation (Gieling   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ) and leukocyte function (Ren   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Gage   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ) during toxic injury of the liver. Transgenic mice with FOXM1 deletion in the myeloid cell lineage also show significantly delayed liver repair (Kalin   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). In addition, FOXM1 has been shown to regulate ROS levels by inducing expression of ROS scavenger genes to control oxidative stress (Park   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Smirnov   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Choi   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). We previously showed that inhibition of FOXM1 in diabetic mouse models of cutaneous wounding resulted in delayed wound closure and decreased recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Further, comparative transcriptomic analysis of human DFUs with acute wounds of skin and oral mucosa implicated FOXM1 as a regulator of the neutrophil response in diabetic wound healing (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). \n\nHere, we investigated the role of FOXM1 in regulating NET formation in acute wounds and DFUs. Comparisons of neutrophil\u2010associated transcriptional signatures between DFUs and acute skin wounds showed partial or complete inhibition of transcripts involved in neutrophil function and response in DFUs. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of FOXM1 increased ROS levels and induced NET formation in human neutrophils, suggesting that loss of FOXM1 contributes to inhibition of healing in DFUs through increased NETs. Furthermore, we identified triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell\u20101 (TREM1) as a neutrophil\u2010specific regulator suppressed in DFUs. Activation of TREM1 promoted FOXM1  neutrophil recruitment, decreased NETs, and enhanced diabetic wound healing   in\u2009vivo  , demonstrating a novel pathway for regulating NET formation in diabetic wounds. Moreover, TREM1 expression correlated with the clinical outcomes of healing in patients with DFUs. Our data identified a novel pathway for regulating NET formation during diabetic wound healing through TREM1/FOXM1. This regulatory pathway serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker to predict clinical patient outcomes and as a target for development of new therapies that can reprogram chronic, nonhealing DFUs into healing\u2010competent wounds. \n\n\n## Results and Discussion \n  \n### Deregulated neutrophil response in DFUs \n  \nWe have previously demonstrated that decreased neutrophils in DFUs results in an overall poorly controlled inflammatory response contributing to inhibition of healing (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). To further investigate this, we assessed the transcriptomic differences by RNA\u2010seq of human DFU samples compared to human skin acute wounds at the day 3 and focused on processes involved in neutrophil function. Enriched GO biological processes in skin acute day 3 wounds included cell movement of neutrophils, infiltration by neutrophils, chemotaxis of neutrophils, and response of neutrophils that were either found absent or partially regulated in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). Several transcripts associated with a neutrophil gene signature were found to be either suppressed or partially regulated in DFUs compared to skin acute day 3 wounds (Fig\u2009 ). Among them are included the cytokines   CSF3  ,   CSF3R  , and   IL6   and the chemokines   CXCL2  ,   CXCL3  ,   CXCL8  , and   CCL2  . In addition, the   STAT3   transcription factor and   TLR2   were found deregulated in DFUs compared to skin acute day 3 wounds. Next, we validated our findings by qPCR of several genes related to the neutrophil gene signature and determined these were induced in skin acute day 3 wounds, but inhibited in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed cell viability of neutrophils' pathway to be upregulated and cell death of neutrophils' pathway to be inhibited in skin acute day 3 wounds, whereas the opposite was observed in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). Neutrophils are the first immune cells to arrive after injury and are involved in killing microbes and activating other cell types involved in the repair process (Brinkmann   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Kaplan & Radic,\u2009 ; Wilgus   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Ley   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). We previously demonstrated that the immune landscape in DFUs is deficient in neutrophils due to lack of the FOXM1 transcriptional regulator. IPA analysis of cell death and viability pathways indicate that the absence of neutrophils in DFUs is due to increased neutrophil death linked to loss of FOXM1. Taken together, these results indicate that the neutrophil response present in skin acute wounds that facilitates healthy\u2010wound healing is deregulated in chronic nonhealing DFUs. \n   Deregulated neutrophil response in human tissue samples obtained from diabetic foot ulcers  \n  \nEnriched GO processes from human skin acute day 3 wounds compared to human DFU demonstrates processes involved in neutrophil function to be deregulated in DFUs compared to acute wounds. \n  \nNeutrophil gene signature comparing human skin acute day 3 wounds to human DFUs demonstrating decreased presence of neutrophils in human DFUs. \n  \nqPCR validations of neutrophil genes.   n  \u2009=\u20097 DFUs and   n  \u2009=\u20093 skin acute day 3 wounds. **  P  \u2009<\u20090.01 (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. \n  \nIngenuity Pathway Analysis of predicted network shows activation of cell viability of neutrophils and inhibition of cell death of neutrophils in human skin wounds compared to activation of cell death of neutrophils in human DFUs. \n  \n  \n\n### FOXM1 inhibition promotes NET formation \n  \nWe have previously shown that blocking the function of FOXM1 inhibits neutrophil responses in DFUs (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Neutrophils from patients with DFUs are known to undergo NET formation resulting in tissue damage and impaired healing (Fadini   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Although apoptosis is the primary form of neutrophil cell death, cell death by NET formation does occur during acute wound healing as a mechanism for eliminating pathogens (Wong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ), which must be tightly regulated to ensure a proper immune response. Diabetes primes neutrophils to undergo NETosis (Wong   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ); as a result, the balance between neutrophil apoptosis and NETosis in diabetic wounds shifts in favor of NETosis, producing an improper neutrophil response and inhibition of wound healing in DFUs. Therefore, we investigated if inhibition of FOXM1 regulates NET formation and contributes to the decreased neutrophil response. We isolated human peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy donors and utilized a pharmacological approach using a specific FOXM1 inhibitor, FDI\u20106. Specificity of FDI\u20106 inhibition of FOXM1 was validated by qPCR and showed decreased expression of   FOXM1   and its target gene   SOD2   (Fig\u2009 ). Treatment with FDI\u20106 resulted in increased NET release compared to vehicle control, implicating FOXM1 in the regulation of NET formation (Fig\u2009 ). NETs were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of citrullinated histone\u20103 (citH3), a marker of neutrophils undergoing NET formation (Wang   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ), with the neutrophil marker elastase (Fig\u2009 ). We further validated NET formation after FOXM1 inhibition using the streptozoticin (STZ)\u2010induced diabetic mouse model and assessed citH3 by immunofluorescence staining. As expected, we found increased citH3 in diabetic wounds. Topical treatment of wounds with FDI\u20106 resulted in increased citH3 compared to vehicle\u2010treated nondiabetic wounds (Fig\u2009 ). These findings demonstrate that inhibition of FOXM1 promotes NET formation. \n   Inhibition of FOXM1 increases ROS and induces NET formation  \n  \nRepresentative images of human neutrophils treated with the FOXM1 inhibitor, FDI\u20106.

Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. **  P  \u2009<\u20090.01 (one\u2010way ANOVA followed by Sidak   post\u2010hoc   test). \n  \n  \nTo determine the mechanism by which FOXM1 regulates NET formation, we assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels after FOXM1 inhibition. ROS generation is implicated in the pathways leading to NET formation (Brinkmann   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Lood   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Pathway analysis revealed suppression of FOXM1 in DFUs results in increased ROS compared to acute skin wounds (Fig\u2009 ). Therefore, we measured ROS levels and NET formation in neutrophils treated with FDI\u20106 in the presence or absence of N\u2010acetylcysteine (NAC), a known inhibitor of ROS and NET formation (Fuchs   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Lim   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Neutrophils treated with phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (PMA), a known inducer of NET formation (Fuchs   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Lim   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ), in the presence or absence of NAC were used as controls. Inhibition of FOXM1 induced ROS and NET formation to levels comparable to PMA (Figs\u2009  and C, and  ). Combination treatment of FDI\u20106 with NAC significantly inhibited ROS levels and NET formation (Fig\u2009  and C). Furthermore, IPA analysis identified FOXM1\u2010regulated genes known to be involved in ROS generation, including   SOD2   and   CAT   that function to inhibit ROS accumulation in acute skin acute day 3 wounds (Fig\u2009 ). They were found to be inhibited in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). These results support that inhibition of FOXM1 leads to increased ROS levels resulting in NET formation in neutrophils. \n   FOXM1 regulates ROS levels during wound healing  \n  \nFOXM1 regulates genes involved in reducing ROS levels and is activated in human skin acute day 3 wounds compared to suppression in human DFUs. \n  \nRepresentative images of human neutrophils treated with the FOXM1 inhibitor, FDI\u20106, in presence or absence of NAC.

(Scale bar: 100\u2009\u03bcm). \n  \n  \n\n### TREM1, inhibited in DFUs, stimulates neutrophil healing responses that are linked to FOXM1 \n  \nNext, we performed IPA analysis to determine potential upstream regulators responsible for regulating FOXM1 pathway in neutrophils that could serve as a potential therapeutic target for patients with DFUs. To further investigate this, we assessed the transcriptomic differences in DFUs compared to skin acute day 3 wounds by RNA\u2010seq and performed IPA analysis to determine specific upstream regulators involved in regulating neutrophil responses during wound healing. Among them, the cytokine\u2010encoding transcripts included   TNF  ,   IL6  ,   IL1B  ,   IFN\u03b3  , and   CSF2  , which were found to be either suppressed or incompletely activated in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). We also found the transcription factors   NF\u03baB  ,   STAT3  ,   STAT1  , and   FOXM1   as well as   P38 MAPK   and   ERK1/2   pathways to be suppressed or less activated in DFUs, in contrast to being found highly upregulated in human skin acute day 3 wounds. Moreover, we identified   TREM1  , a potent amplifier of the inflammatory response known to be highly expressed in neutrophils, to be significantly upregulated in skin acute day 3 wounds, but suppressed in DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). TREM1 is a membrane\u2010bound receptor expressed on myeloid lineage of cells and is a potent stimulator of the inflammatory response (Bouchon   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ,  ; Colonna,\u2009 ). TREM1 activation triggers release of pro\u2010inflammatory molecules such as IL\u20108 and TNF (Colonna,\u2009 ; Carrasco   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ) that we found were inhibited in DFUs. We performed further IPA analysis to determine the role of TREM1 in neutrophil function during wound healing. We identified several enriched processes that are involved in regulation of neutrophil functions that include cell movement of neutrophils, recruitment of neutrophils, and immune response of cells (Fig\u2009 ). These processes were strongly activated in skin day 3 acute wounds and suppressed in DFUs. To determine if TREM1 is linked to FOXM1, we performed analysis connecting TREM1 pathway to FOXM1 and found several genes previously described to be regulated by TREM1 that could promote FOXM1 activation, including   IL1B  ,   IL6  ,   CDK1  ,   AREG  ,   SOD2  , and   CXCL8   (Fig\u2009 ). Taken together, these results indicate that TREM1 may stimulate the neutrophil response present in skin acute wounds through FOXM1 activation to facilitate healthy wound healing. Furthermore, its downregulation in chronic DFUs may be important contributor of nonhealing wounds. \n   TREM1 stimulates the neutrophil response and is linked to FOXM1, that is inhibited in DFUs  \n  \nUpstream regulators found to be activated in human skin wounds that are suppressed or partially regulated in human DFUs involved in neutrophil response. \n  \nTREM1 functions related to neutrophil response shows activation in human skin wounds compared to suppression in human DFUs. \n  \nTREM1 predicted network connecting downstream target genes to their downstream biological processes leading to FOXM1 activation. \n  \n  \n\n### TREM1 activation increases FOXM1  neutrophil recruitment, decreases NETs, and enhances wound healing in diabetic mice \n  \nTo corroborate the human data with an   in\u2009vivo   model, we investigated the effect of TREM1 activation on wound healing using the db/db diabetic mouse model of wound healing. We utilized a pharmacological approach for the activation with the \u237a\u2010TREM1 activator (Bouchon   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). \u237a\u2010TREM1 was topically applied to full\u2010thickness wounds created on dorsal skin of mice. We studied the kinetics of wound healing in wounds treated with \u237a\u2010TREM1 when compared to isotype\u2010matched IgG treatment (vehicle). Treatment with \u237a\u2010TREM1 significantly enhanced wound healing in diabetic wounds compared to control IgG at days 2 and 4 postwounding (Fig\u2009 ), with day 4 being the time point of a peak inflammatory response. \n   Activation of TREM1 enhances wound healing and increases FOXM1  neutrophils in the wounds of diabetic mice  \n  \nRepresentative images of wounded skin after topical treatment with either vehicle (IgG isotype control) or \u237a\u2010TREM1 activator at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8\u2009days after wounding.

Quantification of wound areas in   n  \u2009=\u200910 for vehicle diabetic and 12 wounds for \u237a\u2010TREM1\u2010treated wounds were performed with Fiji software. Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. **  P  \u2009<\u20090.01, and ****  P  \u2009<\u20090.0001 (two\u2010way ANOVA followed by Tukey's   post\u2010hoc   test). \n  \nRepresentative pictures of vehicle (IgG isotype control) and \u237a\u2010TREM1\u2010treated diabetic wounds at day 4 show basal keratin marker K5, and neutrophil marker Ly6G, FOXM1, and citH3. Treatment of wounds with \u237a\u2010TREM1 resulted in increased FOXM1  and decreased citH3  neutrophils compared to vehicle\u2010treated diabetic wounds. (Scale bar: 50\u2009\u03bcm). Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity was performed with Fiji software.   n  \u2009=\u20097 diabetic vehicle wounds and 6 diabetic \u237a\u2010TREM1 wounds. Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, and **  P  \u2009<\u20090.01 (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). \n  \n  \nNext, we tested the effect of TREM1 activation on neutrophil recruitment   in\u2009vivo  , by assessing the presence of FOXM1  neutrophils in day 4 wounds in mice treated with either vehicle or \u237a\u2010TREM1. No significant differences were found in nondiabetic wounds treated with \u237a\u2010TREM1 compared to vehicle (Fig\u2009 ). We found increased presence of FOXM1  neutrophils in \u237a\u2010TREM1\u2010treated diabetic wounds compared to vehicle\u2010treated controls (Fig\u2009 ). Moreover, to assess the NET formation, we quantified FOXM1  and citH3  neutrophils. We found FOXM1  neutrophils inversely correlated with citH3  neutrophils in \u237a\u2010TREM1\u2010treated diabetic wounds, supporting that FOXM1 inhibits NET formation (Fig\u2009 ). These results indicate that TREM1 activation increases FOXM1  neutrophil response in diabetic wounds by inhibiting NET formation and stimulating healing (Fig\u2009 ). \n   Treatment with \u237a\u2010TREM1 has no significant effect on FOXM1 and citH3 in nondiabetic wounds  \nRepresentative pictures of vehicle (IgG isotype control) and \u237a\u2010TREM1\u2010treated nondiabetic wounds at day 4 show basal keratin marker K5, and neutrophil marker Ly6G, FOXM1, and citH3. Treatment of wounds with \u237a\u2010TREM1 resulted in no significant differences in FOXM1  and citH3  neutrophils compared to vehicle\u2010treated wounds. (Scale bar: 50\u2009\u03bcm). Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity was performed with Fiji software.   n  \u2009=\u20093 wounds per group. Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). \n  \nAlthough our data demonstrate TREM1 activation to be associated with increased wound healing in diabetic wounds by inhibiting NET formation, other factors are also known to contribute to inhibition of healing in diabetic wounds. In this complex and mutlifactorial disease, decreased angiogenesis and keratinocyte deregulation are among the hallmarks of DFUs that contribute to impaired wound healing (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Reduced angiogenesis leads to increased cell death due to loss of balance between pro\u2010 and anti\u2010angiogenic factors (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Furthermore, keratinocytes in DFUs lose their migratory capacity and fail to close the wound, contributing to increased risk of infection and amputation (Eming   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). TREM1 has been shown to be expressed on endothelial cells and keratinocytes (Hyder   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ), suggesting that TREM1 activation may exert broad pro\u2010healing effects in diabetic wounds. Future studies are needed to address the role of TREM1 in regulating these processes during diabetic wound healing. \n\n\n### TREM1 expression and neutrophil recruitment contributes to the clinical healing outcome of DFUs \n  \nWe next determined if inhibition of TREM1 and its downstream targets contribute to the nonhealing clinical outcome of patients with DFUs. We obtained tissue samples from patients in which the healing outcome was determined by a surrogate endpoint, the percent reduction in wound size after 4\u2009weeks of standard wound care (Margolis   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Stojadinovic   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). DFUs were grouped into two categories as either healing, in which wound reduction of wound size was greater than 50%; or nonhealing, in which wound reduction was less than 50%. We performed qPCR to quantify   TREM1   and genes encoding for molecules involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment,   CXCL8  ,   CXCR1  , and   CXCR2  , in healing and nonhealing. We found   TREM1  ,   CXCL8  ,   CXCR1  , and   CXCR2   expression to be induced in healing, but suppressed in nonhealing (Fig\u2009 ). To further validate our findings, we performed immunofluorescence staining for TREM1 the NET marker citH3. We found increased presence of TREM1 in tissue obtained from healing DFUs when compared to nonhealing DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). Moreover, citH3 was found decreased in healing DFUs compared to nonhealing DFUs (Fig\u2009 ). Taken together, our data support that TREM1 expression and NET formation are associated with the clinical healing outcome of patients with DFUs. \n   TREM1 expression is associated with the clinical outcome of healing in DFUs  \n  \nqPCR of TREM1 and genes involved in neutrophil recruitment demonstrate increased expression in healing DFUs compared to nonhealing DFUs (  n  \u2009=\u20095 healing and   n  \u2009=\u20096 nonhealing). Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05. **  P  \u2009<\u20090.01 (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). \n  \nRepresentative images of healing and nonhealing DFUs show basal keratin marker K5 and TREM1 and corresponding quantification from healing (  n  \u2009=\u20094) and nonhealing (  n  \u2009=\u20094) is shown in the graph. Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). (Scale bar: 50\u2009\u03bcm). \n  \nRepresentative images of cit\u2010H3 immunohistochemistry show increase staining in nonhealing DFUs when compared to healing DFUs, which was confirmed by corresponding quantification from healing (  n  \u2009=\u20093) and nonhealing (  n  \u2009=\u20093), shown in the graph. Data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's   t  \u2010test). (Scale bar: 50\u2009\u03bcm). \n  \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the role of TREM1 and FOXM1 signaling in regulating NET formation during diabetic wound healing. We performed a comprehensive comparative analysis between tissue biopsies derived from patients with DFUs and human skin acute wounds using next\u2010generation sequencing. We identified FOXM1 as a novel regulator of NET formation through modulation of ROS levels to promote a healthy\u2010neutrophil immune response during wound healing. In addition, we identified TREM1 to be linked to the FOXM1 pathway in this context. Activation of TREM1 increased recruitment of FOXM1  neutrophils and enhanced diabetic wound healing   in\u2009vivo  . We previously found FOXM1 to be downregulated in DFUs, leading to decreased neutrophil response, suggesting modulation of the TREM1/FOXM1 network as a potential therapeutic target for restoring a healthy neutrophil response in diabetic wounds. Moreover, TREM1 expression correlated with the healing outcome of DFUs, further supporting TREM1 as an important regulator of promoting a proper neutrophil immune response during wound healing. Our data demonstrate that lack of TREM1/FOXM1 network in the DFU leads to increased NET formation of neutrophils contributing to inhibition of wound healing. In addition, we identify a novel regulation of NET formation during diabetic wound healing by the FOXM1 network, underscoring its role in pathophysiology of DFUs. As such the TREM1/FOXM1 regulatory network can serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and as therapeutic targets. Targeting this network may achieve restoration of acute healing response in DFUs, reprogramming them into healing competent wounds. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Mice \n  \nAll animal studies were carried out according to the protocol approved by the Animal and Care Committee at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Db/db mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic mice were generated as previously described (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Both male and female mice were used in the wound healing studies. Treatments were performed at 7\u20139\u2009weeks of age and all experiments were conducted using littermate controls. \n\n\n### Wound healing assay   in\u2009vivo  \n  \nFull\u2010thickness wounds were created as previously described (Iglesias\u2010Bartolome   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Uchiyama   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ; Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized, and hair was shaved on dorsal skin and cleaned with 70% ethanol. Wounds were created using 6\u2009mm full\u2010thickness excisional wounds with sterile punch biopsies (Integra Miltex) and topically treated with either 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010TREM1 antibody (R&D Systems; MAB1187) or isotype control anti\u2010IgG (Invitrogen; 31903) dissolved in 1\u00d7 sterile PBS. Treatments were applied every 2\u2009days and digitally photographed at indicated time points and wound areas were measured using Fiji. Changes in wound area are expressed as percentages of initial wound area. \n\n\n### Patient demographics \n  \nFull\u2010thickness DFU (  n  \u2009=\u200913, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation\u2009=\u200956\u2009\u00b1\u200913, 13 males) and DFS (  n  \u2009=\u20098, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation\u2009=\u200966\u2009\u00b1\u200913, 7 males, 1 female) samples were obtained from patients receiving standard care at the University of Miami Hospital Wound Clinic, as previously described (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). The protocols including written informed consent were approved by the university Institutional Review Board (IRB #20140473; #20090709).

Ulcers with clinical signs of infection were excluded. Exclusion criteria for DFU were (i) active cellulitis; (ii) osteomyelitis; (iii) gangrene; (iv) vascular insufficiency (defined as an ankle\u2010brachial index (ABI)\u2009<\u20090.7 and for those with an ABI\u2009>\u20091.3; (v) revascularization to the ipsilateral lower extremity in the last 6\u2009weeks; and (vi) any experimental drugs taken or applied topically to the wound for 4\u2009weeks preceding the study. \n\n\n### Real\u2010time reverse transcriptase   PCR  \n  \nHuman skin, human DFU specimens, and human neutrophils were lysed with TRIAzol and RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sawaya   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). RNA (1.0\u2009\u03bcg) from human skin, human DFUs, or human neutrophils was reverse transcribed using a qScript cDNA kit (QuantaBio) and real\u2010time PCR was performed in triplicates using the Bio\u2010Rad CFX Connect thermal cycler and detection system and a PerfeCTa SYBR Green Supermix (QuantaBio). Relative expression was normalized for levels of ARPC2 or Actin where indicated. The primer sequences for ARPC2 are forward primer (5\u2032\u2010TCCGGGACTACCTGCACTAC\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010GGTTCAGCACCTTGAGGAAG\u20103\u2032); CSF3 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010AAGCTGGTGAGTGAGTGTG\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010GGGATGCCCAGAGAGTGTC\u20103\u2032); CSF3R forward primer (5\u2032\u2010TTGCAGCCCCAACAGGAAG\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010ATGATTGTGGGCACCCAGG\u20103\u2032); IL6 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010CATCCTCGACGGCATCTCAG\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010ACCAGGCAAGTCTCCTCATTG\u20103\u2032); TREM1 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010TGCCCACTCTATACCAGCCC\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010GTTGAACACCGGAACCCTGATG\u20103\u2032); CXCL8 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010GAAGTTTTTGAAGAGGGCTGAGA\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010TTGCTTGAAGTTTCACTGGCATC\u20103\u2032); CXCR1 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010TGGCCGGTGCTTCAGTTAG\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010AGGGGCTGTAATCTTCATCTGC\u20103\u2032); CXCR2 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010CTAAGTGGCACCTGTCCTGG\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010TTCTGACCTGGGTTGCAAGG\u20103\u2032); FOXM1 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010CGTCGGCCACTGATTCTCAAA\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010GGCAGGGGATCTCTTAGGTTC\u20103\u2032); SOD2 forward primer (5\u2032\u2010GCACTAGCAGCATGTTGAGC\u20103\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032\u2010TTGATGTGAGGTTCCAGGGC\u20103\u2032); Actin forward primer (5\u2032\u2010CACCAACTGGGACGACAT\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010ACAGCCTGGATAGCAACG\u20103\u2032). \n\n\n### Neutrophil isolation \n  \nHuman peripheral blood from male and females was collected by venipuncture in heparinized tubes from healthy control subjects recruited at the Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD. Neutrophils were isolated by layering 20\u2009ml of blood on top of 20\u2009ml of PolymorphPrep\u2122 (Progen) and centrifuged at 500\u2009  g   for 35\u2009min. The layer containing the neutrophil fraction was obtained and added to equal volume of 1\u00d7 Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) diluted with equal volumes of water to restore neutrophils to normal osmolality. Neutrophil suspension was centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 400\u2009  g   and resuspended with 0.2% NaCl for red blood cell lysis for 1\u2009min. Equal volumes of 1\u00d7 HBSS was added and neutrophil suspension was centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 400\u2009  g   and resuspended in RPMI media. Neutrophils from three different blood donors were isolated, pooled, and performed in triplicate per each condition. \n\n\n### Quantification of   NET   formation \n  \nNeutrophils were treated with either 5\u2009\u03bcM of FDI\u20106 (Sigma Aldrich), 0.5\u2009\u03bcM of PMA (Sigma Aldrich), in the presence or absence of 5\u2009mM of N\u2010acetylcysteine (Sigma Aldrich). Vehicle (DMSO) served as a control. Neutrophils were pretreated for 30\u2009min with N\u2010acetylcysteine. For experiments involving TREM1, neutrophils were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010TREM1 antibody (R&D Systems) in presence or absence of 5\u2009\u03bcM of FDI\u20106. Isotype control anti\u2010IgG (Bio\u2010Rad) served as a control. SYTOX green dye (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 0.2\u2009\u03bcM. NUCLEAR\u2010ID Red dye (Enzo Life Sciences) was added at a dilution of 1\u2009\u03bcl into 1.5\u2009ml media and was used for staining nuclei of live neutrophils. The IncuCyteS3 instrument software (Essen BioScience) was used to measure NET formation using a previously described protocol (Gupta   et\u2009al  ,\u2009 ). Three image sets from distinct regions per well using a 20\u00d7 objective lens were taken every 20\u2009min and each condition was run in quadruplets. The filters applied to the green channel excluded objects below the radius of 10\u2009\u03bcm, fluorescence threshold of 1.00 green corrected units, and area of 100\u2009\u03bcm . This minimum area threshold for green was used to recognize the decondensed chromatin of cells. NET formation was quantified by normalizing the green object counts to the red object counts to obtain a ratio of the number of neutrophils undergoing NET formation to the total number of live neutrophils. \n\n\n### Immunofluorescence staining and visualization of   NETs   in\u2009vitro  \n  \nNeutrophils were isolated from human blood and grown in either normal glucose (5\u2009mM glucose) or high glucose (25\u2009mM glucose) media and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 5\u2009\u03bcM of FDI\u20106 for 3\u2009h. Neutrophils were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX\u2010100 for 5\u2009min. NETs were detected by immunofluorescence staining using anti cit\u2010Histone 3 antibody (Abcam, 1:300; ab5103) and anti Elastase (Novus Biologicals, 1:300; NBP2\u201053193). NETs were visualized using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscopy. Quantification of NETs was carried out using the NETosis assay commercially available kit (Abcam) according to manufacturer's protocol. \n\n\n### Reactive oxygen species assay \n  \nReactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using ROS\u2010ID Total ROS/Superoxide Detection Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Neutrophils were isolated as described above and the ROS\u2010ID Total ROS/Superoxide Detection Kit was used according the manufacturer's instructions. ROS levels were measured using IncuCyteS3 instrument software (Essen BioScience) and quantified by normalizing green object counts to the total number of live neutrophils. \n\n\n### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nParaffin embedded tissue sections of discarded DFUs were used for staining with anti\u2010Keratin 5 (1:750; LSBio; LS\u2010C22715), and anti TREM1 (1:1,000; Abcam; ab225861). Murine wounds were excised at day 4 postwounding and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C and sections were used for anti Ly6G (1:500; BD Pharmingen; 551459), anti FOXM1 (1:500; Cell Signaling; 20459S), and anti citH3 (1:1,000; Abcam; ab5103) staining. Stainings were visualized with either Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010rabbit antibody (1:500; Invitrogen; A21206), Alexa Fluor 555\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010guinea pig antibody (1:500; Invitrogen; A21435), Alexa Fluor 647\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse antibody (1:500; Invitrogen; A21235) and mounted with VECTASHIELD antifade mounting media with DAPI (Vectorlabs) to visualize cell nuclei. Specimens were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. \n\nFor peroxidase stainings, slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated in xylene and decreasing ethanol solutions. Peroxidase was quenched using 0.3% H O  in methanol for 20\u2009min. Antigen retrieval was performed for 30\u2009min in 95\u00b0 water bath in 10\u2009mM of TRIS, 1\u2009mM of EDTA, 0.1% tween pH\u2009=\u20099 buffer. Slides were washed in PBS and blocked/permeabilized for 10\u2009min with 10\u2009mg/ml gelatin and 1.25% Triton in PBS. Slides were blocked 10\u2009min in 5% FBS, 5% Goat Serum, and 7.5% Bockhen in 1\u00d7 PBS. Slides were blocked for additional 10\u2009min using 50% Background Sniper and 50% Background Punisher solution. Slides were incubated overnight in anti citH3 (1:10,000; Abcam; ab5103) in Background Enhancer at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed 3\u00d7 in PBST and then blocked with 5% goat serum for 10\u2009min. Rabbit on pharma polymer (secondary) was added for 20\u2009min and washed 3\u00d7 with PBST. Immunoperoxidase reaction was stimulated with DAB substrate. Slides were counterstained with Mayers Hemoxatylin and washed/dehydrated with successive ethanol solutions and xylene washes. Dermis peroxidase staining was quantified using deprecated, positive pixel count function in QuPath software. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nPathway enrichment statistics were calculated within the Ingenuity software package using Fisher's exact test with Benjamini\u2010Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Upstream regulators and gene ontology enrichment   P  \u2010values were similarly calculated within IPA using Fisher's exact test. Statistics for NET and ROS assays studies were performed using one\u2010way ANOVA followed by Tukey's posthoc test. Statistics for qPCR validations comparing DFU to acute skin wounds were performed using Mann\u2013Whitney   U   two\u2010tailed test. Statistics for qPCR comparing healing and nonhealing DFUs were performed using two\u2010tailed unpaired   t   test. Statistics for wound healing assay and NET formation assays were performed using either a one\u2010way ANOVA followed by Sidak   post\u2010hoc   test or a two\u2010way ANOVA followed by Tukey's   post\u2010hoc   test where indicated. \n\n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Andrew P Sawaya:   Conceptualization; data curation; formal analysis; validation; investigation; visualization; methodology; writing \u2013 original draft; writing \u2013 review and editing.

Post\u2013exertional malaise is a worsening of these symptoms after a physical or mental exertion and is considered a central feature of the illness. Scant observations in the available literature provide qualitative assessments of post\u2013exertional malaise in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. To enhance our understanding, a series of outpatient focus groups were convened. \n\n Methods:   Nine focus groups totaling 43 patients who reported being diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome were held between November 2016 and August 2019. Focus groups queried post\u2013exertional malaise in daily life and participants' retrospective memory of post\u2013exertional malaise that followed an exercise provocation with a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Data analysis followed the grounded theory method to systematically code and categorize the data to find meaningful patterns. A qualitative software package was used to move text into categories during data coding. \n\n Results:   A wide range of symptoms were attributed to exertion both in daily lives and following cardiopulmonary exercise testing. While three core symptoms emerged (exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and neuromuscular complaints), participants' descriptions were notable for their unique individual variations. Of 18 participants who responded to questions centered around symptoms following a cardiopulmonary exercise test, 17 reported that symptoms started within 24 h and peaked in severity within 72 h following the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Patients described post\u2013exertional malaise as interfering with their ability to lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\n Conclusion:   The experience of post\u2013exertional malaise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome varies greatly between individuals and leads to a diminished quality of life. myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients describe post\u2013exertional malaise as all-encompassing with symptoms affecting every part of the body, difficult to predict or manage, and requiring complete bedrest to fully or partially recover. Given the extensive variability in patients, further research identifying subtypes of post\u2013exertional malaise could lead to better targeted therapeutic options. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPersistent and disabling fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive difficulties, and musculoskeletal/joint pain are characteristic of a disorder that has been referred to as the Royal Free Disease, benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and systemic exertion intolerance disease at various times in history ( ). The term   myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome   is currently the most common term used in diagnostic criteria, by advocates, and by the US Federal Government to refer to the illness ( ). Post\u2013exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of these symptoms after minimal physical or mental exertion ( ). PEM is considered a central feature of ME/CFS ( ). The cause of ME/CFS remains unknown, and there are no approved diagnostic tests or treatments ( ). Historically, measurement of PEM has had considerable controversy, and patient groups have felt left out of the process by which policy makers develop definitions of ME/CFS ( ,  ). Qualitative research affords patients an opportunity to discuss their experiences with researchers at length and inform patient-focused clinical decision making ( ). \n\nPrevious qualitative assessments of ME/CFS have shown a significant and debilitating effect on the lives of patients. ME/CFS patients have described the fatigue experience as all-encompassing and debilitating, fluctuating, unpredictable, often triggered by minor activities, and causing a significant impediment to daily functioning ( ). A previous study using qualitative telephone interviews found the lessening ability to independently perform daily tasks had a significant impact on psychological well-being of ME/CFS patients ( ). The one study of which we are aware that employed focus groups to explore PEM in individuals with ME/CFS ( ) queried patients about different dimensions of fatigue and found distinct physical and cognitive dimensions, including five key themes: exhausted, drained of energy, heavy feeling, cognitive fog, and muscle weakness. \n\nPrevious quantitative studies looking at PEM in ME/CFS patients have shown a wide range of physical and cognitive symptoms affecting every part of the body ( ,  \u2013 ). These studies have detailed common PEM symptoms (e.g., physical fatigue, cognitive exhaustion, muscle pain, unrefreshed sleep, and headaches) and timeframes for symptom onset and duration. A recent study ( ) used survey data to summarize symptoms, triggers, and time patterns for onset and duration of PEM and found most patients experienced several cognitive and physical symptoms and that triggers of PEM can be physical, cognitive, and emotional. That study also found that onset relative to exertion ranged from immediate to more than 24 h, and duration ranged from <1 h to years. \n\nAlthough the scientific literature provides few qualitative assessments of PEM in ME/CFS patients, qualitative descriptions of chronic fatigue have been made in other health disorders. A metasynthesis of fatigue across several long-term conditions such as cancer and stroke, not including ME/CFS, produced some commonalities in the fatigue experience ( ). For instance, participants described fatigue as unpredictable in occurrence, intensity, and duration and feeling a loss of control of the body. Patients with whiplash-associated disorders suffer from fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive deficits similar to ME/CFS patients ( ). Chronic fatigue can be unpredictable and triggered by anxiety and emotional trauma ( ). Using the DePaul PEM Questionnaire, one study found the fatigue experience in a subset of cancer patients was similar to PEM in ME/CFS patients ( ). However, unlike ME/CFS patients, many patients with fatiguing conditions such as multiple sclerosis and post-polio syndrome are able to exercise without experiencing PEM ( ). \n\nBecause PEM in ME/CFS patients is still underexplored, especially through purely qualitative methods, the aim of the current study was to expand the knowledge base on the symptoms; manner of onset; timeframes for onset, peak, and duration of PEM; and impact on day-to-day lives of patients. We aimed to understand how ME/CFS is impacted by exertion in day-to-day life and how this compares to the impact after cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Additionally, we wanted to delve deeper into the experience of PEM following CPET, a gap in the current research. Based on the literature we expected to find a feeling of loss of control and unpredictability to PEM. We also expected to find physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects. \n\nWe present results from nine focus groups conducted to better understand PEM experiences from the perspective of ME/CFS patients. Focus groups were centered on ME/CFS patients' usual daily symptoms and how these changed or worsened following exertion. Additionally, for five of the nine focus groups, we recruited ME/CFS patients who had undergone a CPET evaluation and prompted them to report their memory of the symptoms following the CPET evaluation. The primary purpose of the focus groups was to provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of how ME/CFS patients experience their illness. Secondarily, results from the current study were used to inform the design of an exploratory ME/CFS study at the National Institutes of Health ( ). We present these findings to aid physicians who provide care to these patients and other investigators interested in designing mechanistic studies of PEM. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nWe chose to conduct a qualitative assessment through the collection and analyses of rich textual data enabling depth and nuance of discovery not possible via purely quantitative methods. For example, while surveys may produce a comprehensive list of symptoms, focus groups can capture the personal experiences and importance of specific symptoms from the perspective of individual ME/CFS patients. A qualitative exploratory focus group approach was chosen because of its known benefit for underexplored topic areas and disabled populations ( ,  ,  ). Focus groups offers the ability to understand the unique experiences of patients and provide a deep, more nuanced understanding of the PEM experience within their social worlds. Focus groups have the further benefit of allowing participants to compare and contrast their experiences, which is particularly helpful when exploring a relatively unknown area. Focus group participants were queried about PEM in their daily lives and in relation to previous CPET tests in which they had participated. Nine focus groups were conducted between November 2016 and August 2019. They ranged from 4 to 7 participants per group for a total of 43 participants and ranged in length from 103 to 120 min. All focus groups were conducted over the telephone to enable geographic diversity without travel burden for the ME/CFS participants. \n\nData analysis followed the grounded theory method first developed by Glaser and Strauss ( ). This approach was chosen to generate a theoretical understanding of the experience of PEM within the social context of persons with ME/CFS. Grounded theory is an inductive, iterative method of conducting qualitative research in which theory is built from the data. Focus group scripts were iteratively modified to further explore emergent categories identified during data analysis. Consistent with the grounded theory approach, data were analyzed using the constant comparative method ( ). The constant comparative method is the process of generating conceptual categories from uncategorized data. This involves comparing each piece of data so that similar pieces of data are labeled and grouped to form categories. Every new piece of data is then compared to this categorical structure, and the structure is reconstructed in an iterative manner until no new piece of data challenges the structure's ability to account for all pieces of data ( ). \n\n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited using purposeful sampling, a qualitative sampling procedure in which investigators intentionally recruit participants who have experienced the phenomenon being explored ( ). Specifically, 257 potential participants were interviewed by members of the study team. Recruitment solicitations were posted on ME/CFS advocacy websites and were emailed to persons willing to be contacted for research from the practices of health professionals specializing in the evaluation of ME/CFS patients. The majority of these participants were ME/CFS patients in the community and referred by physicians to exercise physiologists for clinical CPET evaluations. All focus group participants reported having received an ME/CFS diagnosis by a health care provider; an independent verification of medical records was not performed. \n\nWithin the pool of individuals who expressed interest in participating, we sought to maximize variability with respect to age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, severity of impairment (in bed most of the time or not), years since symptoms onset, and geographic location to gain a wide representation. The study was approved by the Combined NeuroScience Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants using a witnessed telephone consenting process. \n\n\n### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing \n  \nCPET is an exercise physiology protocol that is typically used to measure exercise performance and tolerance. It typically involves performing exercise on a cycle ergometer that starts off being easy and steadily becomes harder over time. Participants are instructed to exercise until they reach subjective exhaustion and cannot continue to exercise further ( ). Small studies report that a single CPET session (1-day CPET) is a reliable way to induce PEM in ME/CFS patients ( ). Single-session CPET is being used as a method to induce PEM for scientific inquiry ( ). Some ME/CFS patients undergo an exercise protocol that has them perform two CPET evaluations on sequential days (2-days CPET) as an evaluation of ME/CFS status ( ). \n\nAs we were interested in learning more about PEM following CPET, five of the nine focus groups were restricted to ME/CFS patients who had undergone CPET to probe them about their experiences with PEM following the test. Of the 18 participants who reported on the timeframe for PEM following CPET, half underwent the 2-days CPET, and half underwent the 1-day CPET. Participants who underwent 2-days CPETs were asked to describe symptoms following Day 1, while also explaining any compounding effects from Day 2. \n\n\n### Data Collection \n  \nAll focus groups were conducted by an experienced focus group moderator who had no prior experience with the study population or ME/CFS to ensure impartiality. The semistructured focus group script included broad questions aimed to explore patients' experiences of having PEM, both in their daily lives and in response to the CPET test. Discussion questions centered around activities that can trigger PEM, specific symptoms of PEM, how long after exertion symptoms began, how long the symptoms lasted, and at what point the symptoms were at their worst. Participants were also asked about strategies they employed to try to alleviate symptoms of PEM. With respect to the discussion questions related to the CPET test, we sought to gain a complete picture of how patients felt before the test, during the test, and following the test, including a better understanding of the experience of the onset and course of symptoms.   shows the final version of discussion questions. \n  \nFocus group discussion questions. \n  \nAt the start of each focus group, participants were given information about the purpose of the discussion and basic ground rules for the discussion such as giving everyone a chance to speak and that there were no right or wrong answers. As is usual during the conduct of focus groups, some participated more than others. However, the moderator systematically solicited participation from each participant and intervened when the discussion veered off topic. Participants often \u201cfed off\u201d each other generating broad and comprehensive discussions. Based on the potential for overexertion, focus groups were limited to 2 h, which allowed for most participants to answer every question; occasionally, not every participant responded to all discussion questions. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nFor reasons explained above, we chose the grounded theory approach and, within that approach, the constant comparative method to analyze our data. Data analysis began after the first focus group and continued iteratively throughout the study. Three researchers developed the coding scheme individually and through team meetings and discussions. In-depth meetings were held to discuss coding differences at length and reach consensus. By the completion of the ninth focus group, salient themes were confirmed and repeated with no new themes emerging (i.e., saturation), signaling an end for the need for further participant recruitment ( ). A qualitative software package ( ) was used that automated the analysis process described above by allowing the researchers to electronically highlight words or phrases from each transcript and drag them into folders labeled for each theme and subtheme. The software package also allowed for easily combining or separating categories as needed based on analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nForty-three participants with ME/CFS participated in nine focus groups. Participant demographics are shown in  . Eight overarching themes emerged with salience to ME/CFS patients' experiences with PEM. Themes included the following: (1) PEM was triggered by three broad categories of events; (2) effects of PEM were impacted by baseline pre-exertional symptoms; (3) PEM had a wide symptom range with few differences between daily PEM and PEM following CPET, with three core symptoms (exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and neuromuscular complaints); (4) PEM following CPET was more immediate and of longer duration than PEM in daily life; (5) the manner of onset of PEM symptoms varied; (6) complete rest was necessary to gain any relief in PEM symptoms; (7) planning and moderation of energy expenditure were seen as essential to avoiding PEM; and (8) the uncertainty and debility of PEM created despair. \n  \nDemographic characteristics of focus group participants (  n   = 43). \n  \n### Theme 1. PEM Was Triggered by Three Broad Categories of Events \n  \nWe asked focus group participants to give examples of activities that caused them to have PEM. Notably, there were three broad categories of activities: physical activity, cognitive effort, and emotion precipitated, although there was overlap across the three groups. These categories included triggers such as household chores, social activities, errands outside of the home, physical exercise, cognitive activities, and emotional moments ( ). \n  \nExamples of post\u2013exertional malaise triggers given by focus group respondents. Some triggers fall into multiple categories. \n  \nOne participant explained how a trip to the grocery store can cause PEM: \n \n\u201c  I can go grocery shopping 1 day and I am completely spent for 2 or 3 days.\u201d  \n \nAnother participant described how a trip to Walmart can cause PEM: \n \n\u201c  I'm walking through Walmart to get my prescriptions but I'll feel ok, but then as soon as I get home it's like flipping a switch, and I just immediately have no energy.\u201d  \n \nParticipants frequently described how cognitive effort can cause PEM symptoms, as this participant described: \n \n\u201c  I specifically notice it if I've had a one-on-one conversation with a friend. After about anywhere from 30 min to an hour, my brain literally starts to shut down, and I can't think clearly and I can't pay attention anymore.\u201d  \n \nAnother cognitive trigger example was described: \n \n\u201c  Yesterday I was doing some sorting of a folder trying to clean some things out not even like processing just keeping this, throwing out that, and like an hour of that really burned my brain. I could feel that immediately after.\u201d  \n \nMany participants also described how PEM can be caused by social or emotional stress. One participant described the effect of having her parents visit on a Saturday: \n \n\u201c  Compared to a normal Saturday for me, which is just having my son at home with my husband, I engaged in several hours of social interaction, which I normally don't do. I have all this extra stress of parents coming. It's unexpected and other people in my house and all of that. So the next day midmorning, I start feeling bad and I know I definitely need to rest. So I start feeling bad and I lay down. I am basically in bed for 4 h.\u201d  \n \nAnother participant explained how stress can be a trigger for PEM: \n \n\u201c  Stress is a big trigger. If I have a lot of things going on, a lot of things I need to do, or a lot of things I need to accomplish, and/or feel like I need to accomplish, it's hard for me to let go of those things. And I don't get better as quickly if I don't recognize it.\u201d  \n \n\n### Theme 2. Effects of PEM Were Impacted by Baseline Pre-exertional Symptoms \n  \nWhen focus group participants were asked to describe PEM following exertion, many expressed the importance of understanding their \u201cstarting point\u201d or \u201cbaseline.\u201d Participants described the pliable nature of symptoms and how successive exertion can compound symptoms. One participant explained this compounding effect: \n \n\u201c  Two days after going to the doctor, my baseline was now exacerbated. It took much less [to cause PEM]. It could now be just having to get in the car and go get my kids, which I do every single day. I'm now unable to do because of that doctor appointment 2 days prior.\u201d  \n \nHaving an accurate assessment of baseline was particularly important for PEM following CPET evaluation. Many patients had to travel a long way to get to the site where the CPET was performed. These participants explained that PEM can be compounded by back-to-back exertion and that travel was a trigger for PEM. One participant explained: \n \n\u201c  I had to travel several days across a number of states and I had to fly and all that, so it took a lot out of me just to get to the site of the testing, so I was feeling worse than a typical day for me by the time I got to the test site.\u201d  \n \nAnother participant described the effect of the travel to get to the CPET: \n \n\u201c  Flying from Illinois to California and all the traveling, even with having a wheelchair, there was still walking and stress of traveling. I was going in already at a low baseline.\u201d  \n \nBecause ME/CFS symptoms can vary widely based on exertion in daily living, to accurately detect changes in symptoms from before to after CPET, it is imperative to obtain a thorough pre-CPET assessment. \n\nThis concept was not limited to CPET evaluation, but also was frequently mentioned in relation to daily PEM. Participants emphasized that when they overexert while already in an episode of PEM, the result was amplified. \n\nThis participant described how PEM symptoms can compound: \n \n\u201c  If I do make it to the point where I almost faint, it is harder to recover from. Those situations for me are only happening if I just keep letting it compound, if this is several weeks of overexertion or having a cold or another issue.\u201d  \n \nThis compounding effect has implications for the management of PEM as described in a later section. \n\n\n### Theme 3. PEM Had a Wide Symptom Range With Few Differences Between Daily PEM and Following CPET, With Three Core Symptoms (Exhaustion, Cognitive Difficulties, and Neuromuscular Complaints) \n  \nDuring focus groups, we asked participants to describe symptoms they have experienced following exertion, both in their daily lives and following a CPET evaluation. We purposely did not query participants about specific symptoms, but rather asked a general open-ended question, \u201cWe'd like to hear some specific examples of how you feel throughout your entire body after exertion.\u201d The purpose of this inquiry was to capture these complaints in the participant's own words. As such, no attempt was made to verify medical symptoms or diagnosis. Additionally, the intention of asking participants about symptoms was to determine the range and most commonly reported symptoms, but it was not feasible in the limited time to query each participant about every potential symptom. Furthermore, the benefit of using focus groups was to capture the most salient symptoms to participants without medical jargon or predetermined categories.   and  ,   present the range and frequency of symptoms reported during focus groups, both for daily PEM and following CPET evaluation. Similar symptoms were reported for daily PEM and PEM following CPET evaluation. In response to this general question, nearly all participants described three core symptoms (exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and neuromuscular complaints), both for daily PEM and PEM following CPET evaluation. \n  \nNumber of focus group participants with self-described post\u2013exertional malaise symptoms. \n  \n The medical groupings listed on this table are based on the participant's own description of the symptoms. No medical examination was given, nor was there an attempt to verify or qualify self-report symptom  . \n    \nSymptoms of daily post\u2013exertional malaise. \n    \nSymptoms of post\u2013exertional malaise following cardiopulmonary exercise test. \n  \n#### Theme 3a. Exhaustion \n  \nParticipants explained that the exhaustion from PEM is different than what they experienced before having ME/CFS. One participant put it this way: \n \n\u201cAnd it's a flulike exhaustion, really tiring. I used to be an athlete. I had a very intense job. So I would feel a lot of fatigue from those activities. But this is not that type of fatigue. This is a type of fatigue I felt when I rarely got the flu, years ago. Only that flu lasted for a few days and not for the years they have now.\u201d \n \nFor some participants, the exhaustion from PEM was severe as explained by a participant: \n \n\u201cOn some days, just walking from my bed to the bathroom was exhausting\u201d \n \nAnother participant explained how PEM: \n \n\u201cFeels like you've had the flu, and you're just so weak and everything hurts, and you're exhausted trying to take a shower.\u201d \n \nAnother participant described exhaustion following CPET as: \n \n\u201cI was exhausted. My arms and legs felt like Jell-O. Like they didn't want to do things.\u201d \n \nSimilarly, another explained that after CPET: \n \n\u201cThey just had to pick me up and toss me on the bed that they keep next to the bike. I couldn't even get off the bike and onto the bed myself because I was so exhausted.\u201d \n \n\n#### Theme 3b. Cognitive Difficulties \n  \nCognitive difficulties were described as both difficulty thinking clearly/paying attention and difficulty speaking or finding words. \n\nOne participant described cognitive difficulties as: \n \n\u201cI get what I call molasses-type thinking. So I can still think, but it's harder to think and harder to put ideas together. And sometimes I have to read things over a few times to make them stick in my brain.\u201d \n \nAnother explained: \n \n\u201cI can't think clearly. I'm unable to make any decisions about anything. Numbers, I feel almost like they're Greek, and they just don't make sense to me anymore at all.\u201d \n \nThinking clearly was a common complaint as another described: \n \n\u201cI can be in a complete fog for a couple of days, and it is hard to make any decisions or remember basic things.\u201d \n \nSimilarly, another participant described: \n \n\u201cI find it much harder to follow a conversation or a story.\u201d \n \nWhen describing the difficulty talking or finding words, one participant described: \n \n \u201cWith speaking verbally, with words that I have known forever. The words weren't there anymore  .\u201d \n \n\n#### Theme 3c. Neuromuscular Complaints \n  \nPatients often complained of neuromuscular symptoms, which included muscle pain/aches and muscle weakness. One participant described the overall muscle pain as: \n \n\u201cIt's like pain has suddenly flared. They'll just be days that are like every exercise in any position I do just hurts. And I try something different, and it hurts and it hurts, and everything is just very irritated and I just have to stop, you know, I can't keep going.\u201d \n \nWhen describing muscle weakness, a participant talked about a three-block walk: \n \n\u201cI walked three blocks to a CVS and we were in there for maybe 10 min. And I had to leave; my legs were getting so weak they were shaky as if I had just run 10 miles. I had to go out and sit down. We had to go to a coffee place and sit for 20 to 30 min before I could move again to go three blocks back.\u201d \n \nAnother participant compared muscle weakness to falling out of a truck: \n \n\u201cLike having glue between my muscles and feeling bruised all over, like I fell out of a truck.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the three core symptoms, participants described a wide range of other symptoms including sensory sensitivity, feelings of despair, difficulty sleeping, headaches, nausea, and sore throat, among others ( ). Furthermore, no obvious symptom patterns or subsets emerged, but rather PEM symptoms were very specific to the individual. Additionally, patients reported several individual subcategories of major symptoms. For example, within the musculoskeletal subcategory, participants separately described muscle pain and muscle weakness, and as noted above, within cognitive difficulties, participants saw a distinction between difficulty focusing/thinking clearly and difficulty finding words/delayed talking. Participants also told us they view their physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms as separate. As one participant explained: \n \n\u201cA physical reaction and emotional reaction are just so separate.\u201d \n \nOthers explained how the emotional aspects can be tied to the unpredictability of PEM. One participant explained: \n \n\u201cYou're questioning what awaits you. It's daily and in every single thing you do, everything you commit to. It's hard.\u201d \n \nWhile not as commonly mentioned as the three core symptoms, many participants described sensitivity to light, sound, and smell as part of PEM. One participant explained: \n \n\u201cI have to put on earphones. I need to block the sound. I wear a mask to block the light, wear sunglasses.\u201d \n \nWhen describing sensory sensitivity another participant said: \n \n\u201cI have to keep my room dark and noise to a minimum. If that's not good enough, then I have to wear an eye mask and earplugs to decrease the noise.\u201d \n \nAnother talked about her sensitivity to noise: \n \n\u201cEven what's normal noise for people was painful to me. It would make me cry.\u201d \n \n\n\n### Theme 4. PEM Following CPET Was More Immediate and of Longer Duration Than PEM in Daily Life \n  \nFocus group participants were asked about the timeframes for PEM symptoms, both after exertion in their daily lives and following CPET. We wanted to better understand when PEM symptoms began, peaked, and subsided. Open-ended questions were asked about PEM with no predetermined time frame provided to participants. We analyzed data for post\u2013daily exertion and post-CPET separately ( ,  ). For daily PEM, most participants perceived a delayed onset of symptoms, with nearly half reporting symptoms beginning 12\u201348 h after exertion. In contrast, more than three-quarters of participants reporting the onset of symptoms following CPET said they began immediately or within several hours. For participants who gave a timeframe for when symptoms of daily PEM peaked, nearly all agreed they peaked within 48 h after exertion, whereas peak in symptoms following CPET was reported sooner, with more than half saying they peaked within 24 h following the test. Approximately half of participants describing PEM from typical daily activities said that symptoms lasted between 2 and 7 days. Half of participants who described PEM symptoms following CPET said the duration was 48\u201396 h. \n  \nTimeframes for onset, peak, and duration of daily post\u2013exertional malaise. \n    \nTimeframes for onset, peak, and duration of post\u2013exertional malaise following cardiopulmonary exercise test. \n  \nFocus group participants contrasted PEM following CPET with PEM in their daily lives. This enabled participants to illustrate how the test pushed them beyond their usual activities. In particular, for many participants PEM following CPET was more immediate than PEM in their daily lives. Fourteen of 18 participants described having symptoms immediately or within a few hours following CPET compared to less than half of participants describing daily PEM. Many participants described sudden and immediate symptoms following the CPET, and for some, these began while still exercising on the bike, as described by this participant: \n \n\u201cDuring the test and right after I felt terrible. I felt I was going to pass out and very out of breath. I felt extremely nauseous like I was going to throw up. I felt very weak, and I was shaking, and they had to help get me off the bike.\u201d \n \nAnother participant explained: \n \n\u201cAs soon as I got off of the bike, I was incredibly wobbly. My muscles weren't working right, like I couldn't get them to work well. So they had me lie flat immediately for about an hour. During that time I started to feel sick. And by the time I got back to the hotel, I was in bed for the rest of the day.\u201d \n \nIn addition to having more immediate symptoms following CPET, many also talked about how the CPET symptoms were more severe than PEM symptoms in daily life. As one participant told us: \n \n\u201cIt was radically different than what normal life is because a lot of energy was expended in a short period of time\u2026 My day to day life is much different than that. I don't normally use energy that quickly and in that quantity. It's usually more of a gradual pronounced thing, whether it's working around the house a little bit, doing different chores\u2026 Normally that buildup of energy happens over a longer period of time.\u201d \n \nAnother explained that: \n \n\u201cThe symptoms [following CPET] were similar to PEM in day to day life, but they're multiplied by a factor of five, every one of them.\u201d \n \nAnother participant agreed the symptoms were similar but more intense: \n \n\u201cI'm not sure the symptoms were a whole lot different than what I normally experience. It was just so much all at once.\u201d \n \nReinforcing that PEM following CPET was more severe than daily PEM, this participant described how she still has not fully recovered: \n \n\u201cBy the time I got home, I was pretty much a wreck. I was able to walk into the house on my own with my husband helping hold me up but I was unable to function at all. I wasn't brushing my teeth. I was just focused on getting to the bathroom. And I would say it took 4 months before I came back to close to my baseline. I don't think I've ever returned back to what I was before I walked into that test.\u201d \n \n\n### Theme 5. The Manner of Onset of PEM Symptoms Varied \n  \nSeparate from when PEM began (as shown in  ,  ), we also determined whether participants perceived the onset of symptoms as sudden or gradual. We asked them to describe the transition from before exertion to experiencing symptoms of PEM. Many participants explained that it varied such that some symptoms came on suddenly and other symptoms were more gradual. As one participant explained: \n \n\u201cThe hand tremors were sudden. The other symptoms I would say were more gradual. The other symptoms being the body pain, the diarrhea, the low-grade fever.\u201d \n \nFor participants who reported their symptoms to have a usual onset, they were nearly evenly split between gradual and sudden onset. One participant described the gradual onset of symptoms as: \n \n\u201cIt was gradual. The symptoms just started coming on, and they just kept getting a little bit worse and a little bit worse and a little bit worse.\u201d \n \nAnother participant said that for her the onset is usually sudden. She explained: \n \n\u201cThe symptoms often happen with an episode of low blood pressure, near fainting experience. And so, when they're combined, it's very sudden. And I can have an episode of almost fainting that comes on within minutes.\u201d \n \nInterestingly, 11 focus group participants described experiencing an adrenaline rush while doing an activity before the PEM symptoms came on, both in daily activities and during the CPET. These participants described experiencing \u201cadrenaline,\u201d \u201cendorphins,\u201d and \u201ceuphoria.\u201d One participant described this feeling after CPET as: \n \n\u201cI get that high of feeling like, wow, I can do anything\u2026\u201d \n \nAnother explained: \n \n \u201cEmotionally right after my test I felt elated  .\u201d \n \nAnother said, \n \n \u201cI had a surge of endorphins and adrenaline during the test  .\u201d \n \n\n### Theme 6. Complete Rest Was Necessary to Gain Any Relief in PEM Symptoms \n  \nWhen asked what could alleviate PEM symptoms, virtually every participant agreed that while in an episode of PEM, complete rest was absolutely necessary to reduce symptoms. Many participants emphasized that this was not a strategy so much as an outcome. For these participants, complete rest was a \u201cdemand from the body.\u201d One participant described it as: \n \n\u201cI have to say that the only thing that helps me, that helps those symptoms start to subside is complete rest. There is not a drug, there is nothing. It is complete rest\u201d \n \nAnother participant elaborated, \n \n\u201cComplete rest is really the only thing that can facilitate a recovery for me. Basically, I have to stop and put things on hold because I realize when I am weakened with PEM, if I push through\u2026 I will end up making the symptoms worse, like going downhill really fast.\u201d \n \nAnother described: \n \n\u201cIt feels like life has all but shut down. It's such a profound undercutting of everything that feels positive, everything that feels like you can make a movement out or forward or up. Somebody was talking about the need to lie down. It's not even just a need. It's an absolute necessity. And I think that PEM just courses through your body and steals everything away that you think of as lively.\u201d \n \nWhen asked to describe what \u201ccomplete rest\u201d entails, most participants described lying down \u201cabsolutely flat\u201d and with as little sensory input as possible. For many, this included ear plugs, darkness, and solitude. Some participants minimized going to the bathroom or had a bedside toilet option. In addition to complete rest, participants described a wide array of practices including over-the-counter and prescription medications, relaxation techniques, special diets, and professional counseling. \n\n\n### Theme 7. Planning and Moderation of Energy Expenditure Was Essential to Avoiding PEM \n  \nAn interesting theme that emerged during focus group discussions centered around the steps taken by participants to manage activity levels in their daily lives to minimize the effects of PEM. This evolved into an in-depth discussion of pacing and its importance to ME/CFS patients in coping with the illness. Many participants described months or years of learning strategies for mitigating PEM. One participant explained: \n \n\u201cNow that I know how to manage my illness better and I know to always rest more than I need to, I don't have big crashes very often. I'm able to maintain a certain equilibrium as long as I stay within my energy envelope, and I have to be very strict about it. I've missed weddings and funerals and births and birthdays, and I have to be very, very careful, but I'm doing better overall, and my quality of life from day to day is better. And, so, I don't have very many crashes. So, I've kind of finally figured out how to keep that equilibrium, but it's very tentative.\u201d \n \nAnother participant described the importance of planning ahead: \n \n\u201cIf it's a really big thing, say I know that I've got to run a lot of errands that are unavoidable, I will actually look at the calendar and make sure that I don't have anything back to back, there's nothing going on for days after.\u201d \n \nCalendar management was an important aspect as a participant described: \n \n\u201cThe other part of it is really, really managing my calendar. If I have a doctor's appointment, there is literally nothing else that I can get done that day and I have in my head to be prepared for it. So, I keep lots of tasks lists and things that need to get done, and during the week, I sort of move things around or, you know, change things.\u201d \n \nAlong with learning to pace themselves, many participants described the compounding aspect of PEM. One participant explained: \n \n \u201cIf I'm already in PEM and overexert, I feel the effects instantly and more intensely, and it lasts deeper and longer  .\u201d \n \nAnother explained: \n \n \u201cIt's not just an add-on it's a multiplier. It's like an exponential effect on it. So to overdo while you're having PEM is much worse than overdoing when you're not in PEM  .\u201d \n \nAlthough participants talked at length about the importance of moderating activities, many also emphasized that it is not easy, and PEM can be unpredictable. As one participant explained: \n \n\u201cOne of the confusing things about symptoms is that they sometimes respond to behavioral changes, so, e.g., not doing certain things in order to not trigger the symptoms. And yet, other times is seems to happen no matter what you try to do differently. It's just not easy to predict or mange.\u201d \n \nFinally, many participants talked about the \u201clearning curve\u201d involved in managing activities in order to avoid PEM. Many took years of overexerting and \u201ccrashing\u201d before learning better how to manage having ME/CFS. One participant put it this way: \n \n\u201cWhen I first got sick, I wasn't even familiar with the concept of pacing. So I was constantly in the cycle of overdoing it and crashing and overdoing it and crashing.\u201d \n \n\n### Theme 8. The Uncertainty and Debility of PEM Created Despair \n  \nWe asked focus group participants to describe the emotional aspects of having ME/CFS and PEM in particular. Participants talked at length about living with the unpredictability of PEM and having to adjust their lives to try to avoid severe PEM. Participants described the anxiety of not knowing how long the PEM would last and if they would ever return to their pre-PEM state. One participant summed it up as, \n \n \u201cI have a kind of post exertional despair that maybe I'll never get better  .\u201d \n \nOther respondents described the difficulty in having ME/CFS symptoms on a daily basis and knowing that PEM could occur at any time, such as a participant who said: \n \n \u201cThe real hard part is that you have to choose. You can't just do this. My life is never going to be complete  .\u201d \n \nAnother participant explained the unpredictability of PEM: \n \n\u201cIt seems unpredictable in my case because I could do the same thing two different days, and 1 day it affects me a lot more than the other day.\u201d \n \nAnother explained the despair in living with PEM: \n \n \u201cI have been sick so long that I really don't have a life. I would give anything to have just some part of my life back  .\u201d \n \nAnother participant explained the toll PEM has taken on her life, \n \n \u201cIt's substantially different than my life was before, and it's debilitating to my life  .\u201d \n \n\n\n## Patient's Experiences of PEM \n  \n diagrams the overall experience of PEM described by focus group participants. Focus group analysis revealed an inability to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life as a core aspect of the PEM experience as described by patients. The widespread mind and body symptoms coupled with the unpredictability of triggering events and the timing of onset and recovery of PEM create disabling consequences for ME/CFS patients. While many patients have found some success in managing PEM through pacing and forgoing previously joyful activities, our analyses nevertheless revealed a profound sense of loss and hopelessness in several participants. When describing the symptoms, timeframe, and experience of PEM, many found it helpful to contrast PEM to how \u201cnormal\u201d people experience energy. An example is a participant describing her lack of energy throughout the day, \n  \nExperience of post\u2013exertional malaise. \n   \n\u201cA normal person's energy is almost energy on demand throughout the day aside from resting every 24 h, but for us, it is such a lag for recuperating energy.\u201d \n \nAnother explained: \n \n\u201cI feel like I'm just constantly assessing my energy level, and normal people don't do that. They get up in the morning and they pretty much know that they can get through a list of things to do, whereas it can take me weeks to get two or three things done, sometimes none at all.\u201d \n \nFocus group participants similarly contrasted their cognitive fatigue with \u201cnormal\u201d people as this participant explained: \n \n\u201cYou cannot focus on simple things like remembering the name of a lamp\u2026 the word won't come. I can't balance a checkbook, can't do any kind of math, can't absorb information. People will be explaining something to you, and it's like they're speaking another language, and my mind will not focus on what they're saying. Those are times I stay home because I shouldn't be driving. I shouldn't be operating any kind of machinery. I shouldn't be cooking because I'm not able to function on a \u2018normal' basis like everybody else does.\u201d \n \nParticipants also described the inability to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life due to the compounding effect of PEM. One participant explained this in relation to a visit from relatives, \n \n\u201cSo my parents decide to come, and it immediately becomes this stressful situation because my mom is a delegator, and she's saying we need to bring our dog and start looking for a dog-friendly hotel and a place to stay with her RV, and she's already delegating and putting this stuff on me without realizing what she's doing. So all of that may not seem like much to a normal healthy person, but that starts building throughout the day.\u201d \n \nThis lack of living a normal life came up related to adjustments people have made in their daily lives to try to minimize PEM. As one participant described: \n \n\u201cThere are all sorts of things we do to try to minimize PEM. I used to listen to music and I don't do that anymore. And there are all sorts of things that when anyone sees me doing this, I look pretty normal. But they don't see all the planning and all the changes I've made in order to do something. Like going outside, I used to hike. I can't do that anymore. But I can still sit down and picnic, and that looks normal to someone else.\u201d \n \n\n## Discussion \n  \nFocus groups analyses found that PEM is significantly disruptive to the lives of ME/CFS patients, often being unpredictable and difficult to control. Day-to-day activities such as going to the grocery store or having a family member visit can cause PEM, and symptoms are wide ranging with every part of the body affected. This is the first in the literature using purely qualitative methods to study PEM following CPET, and findings point to more immediate and longer-lasting PEM than occurring in patients' day-to-day lives. Participants also described the necessity of lying flat and minimizing sensory input to recover from PEM and tedious planning to try to avoid episodes of PEM. The PEM experience for ME/CFS patients can create a significant emotional impact. \n\nThe wide range of symptoms found in the current study has been found in previous research. For instance, a previous review article found that symptoms affect every part of the body ( ). Similarly, Chu et al. ( ) found over a dozen PEM symptoms affecting all parts of the body and also noted a different cluster of symptoms among men and older patients vs. women. The current study found no discrete symptom groups, and in fact, many individual symptoms were reported by only one or two participants. \n\nIn addition to wide-ranging symptoms, the current study found three core PEM symptoms: exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and neuromuscular complaints. While several studies have found core PEM symptoms, the exact set differs across studies, although nearly all have found some form of physical fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and pain as core symptoms. A recent study ( ) used open-ended questionnaire data and predefined symptom categories to determine PEM symptoms in ME/CFS patients following CPET testing. That study found fatigue, muscle/joint pain, and cognitive dysfunction occurred with greatest frequency, overlapping substantially with the current findings. A previous study examining PEM across several countries found fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, disturbed/unrefreshed sleep, and pain presenting as common symptoms across patients ( ). Another study found fatigue, difficulty concentrating, difficulty thinking, and muscle pain as the top four PEM symptoms in ME/CFS patients ( ), and another found reduced stamina, physical fatigue, cognitive exhaustion, and problems thinking to be the most common PEM symptoms ( ). Several studies have found unrefreshed sleep/sleep disturbance as a core PEM symptom reported via questionnaire data ( ,  ). Sleep disturbances or unrefreshed sleep was reported by about one-quarter of participants in the current study. One-third of participants in the current study reported sensory sensitivity, higher in frequency than previous studies using questionnaire data ( ,  ). Differences across studies may be due to differences in data collection methods and/or differences in the demographics of the study populations. None used a random sample of patients, and most used an exhaustive list of symptoms rather than the open-ended approach used in the current study. \n\nOur findings overlap substantially with a previous focus group study of PEM in ME/CFS patients. That study found five main themes related to symptoms: feeling exhausted or tired, feeling heaviness in the limbs or whole body, sensing fogginess in the head, feeling weakness in the muscles, and feeling drained of energy ( ). These findings overlap with the three core symptoms that emerged from the current study. \u201cCognitive difficulties\u201d is comparable to \u201csensing fogginess in the head,\u201d \u201cmuscle pain and weakness\u201d is akin to \u201cfeeling weakness in the muscles,\u201d and \u201cexhaustion\u201d overlaps with \u201cfeeling drained of energy\u201d and \u201cfeeling exhausted or tired ( ).\u201d This previous study found that physical or cognitive exertion can cause PEM, and basic daily activities such as bathing, dressing, toileting, and reading can be triggers. The current study similarly found a wide range of physical and cognitive activities can trigger PEM, but also found that emotional events are common triggers. Focus group participants described how the emotional stress from family visits or funerals can trigger PEM symptoms. Previous studies using questionnaires have similarly found that emotional distress can cause PEM ( ,  ,  ). \n\nThe current findings in conjunction with previous studies presenting descriptors of PEM symptoms have translated into multiple labels used for similar symptoms. For example, Chu et al. ( ) list \u201cpoor concentration\u201d and \u201cdifficulty thinking\u201d separately among the top symptoms, whereas Holtzman et al. ( ) list \u201ccognitive exhaustion\u201d and \u201cproblems thinking\u201d separately. The current study found differences reported by participants between \u201cdifficulty focusing or thinking clearly,\u201d \u201cmemory problems,\u201d and \u201cdelayed speech or difficulty finding words.\u201d These cognitive symptoms may correspond to the neurocognitive domains of attention/executive functioning, memory, and language functioning, although it is also possible that cognitive symptoms that appear to be describing deficits in one domain (e.g., language) are actually the downstream effect of disruption of another domain (e.g., attention/executive functioning). Regardless, in conducting neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies of ME/CFS, the current study may suggest focused assessment of those three cognitive domains and the brain networks that subserve them. The wide variety of ways in which people describe the same experience may cause inconsistencies in the performance of patient outcome questionnaires used to measure PEM symptoms. Underreporting of symptoms with PEM symptom questionnaires has been previously observed ( ). Open-ended questions to allow research participants to express their personal nuances of PEM may be needed in addition to standardized instruments, to accurately discern the onset and severity of PEM in an experimental setting. \n\nPEM in the current study was similar to PEM found in veterans with Gulf War syndrome who rated exercise as painful and fatiguing ( ). However, prolonged effects from PEM occurred more often and with greater duration among ME/CFS ( ) patients than patients with multiple sclerosis and postpolio syndrome, suggesting that the fatigue experience is multifaceted with variation across patient groups. \n\nThe current study is the first in the available literature using qualitative methods to compare daily PEM and PEM following CPET evaluation. Patients emphasized the importance of understanding pre-exertion state to fully assess the effects of PEM. Furthermore, current findings highlight that PEM following CPET was more immediate and of longer duration than PEM in daily life. For both daily and following CPET, participants said recovery took several days to several weeks or even months with more variation seen for daily PEM. These findings are in keeping with the literature. Jason et al. ( ) found variability in the duration or onset of fatigue after activity, from an hour to over a day. Another ME/CFS study ( ) found PEM came on immediately for some, and for others, it was delayed and that it often depended on the intensity of activity. Many of the current participants also described variability based on the intensity of activity and whether they were already in the midst of a PEM episode. \n\nAlso unique to the current study is querying patients about whether they perceived a sudden or gradual onset of PEM symptoms. Like other aspects of ME/CFS, no clear pattern was seen. Regardless of specific symptoms, timing, and onset of PEM, participants nearly all agreed that recovery from PEM required complete rest, and this rest must include as little sensory input as possible. \n\nThe need on the part of ME/CFS patients for calendar management and pacing has been seen in several prior studies ( \u2013 ). A prior focus group study found that patients can benefit by learning their body signals and by individually tailored activities ( ). Clinical and experimental studies should consider providing schedules to participants prior to the study to enable alterations to be made to aid in participant pacing. Likewise, every attempt should be made to allow ME/CFS participants to have complete rest to recover from PEM. Studies of PEM should be cognizant of this need in providing after CPET care for ME/CFS participants. Pacing has also been found as beneficial with postpolio syndrome ( ) and chronic pain and fatigue ( ). \n\nThe current study touched upon the emotional toll of coping with ME/CFS. Researchers and clinicians should take care to appreciate and address the deep despair conveyed by ME/CFS patients. For some, the daily toll of living with ME/CFS has been devastating. There currently exist few treatments for ME/CFS and current clinical protocols focus on management. A previous study found that stress management interventions might alleviate PEM in some patients ( ). The current finding that emotional triggers can cause PEM adds additional evidence that stress management could be beneficial. \n\n\n## Study Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations to this study. First, responses were dependent on retrospective recall of participant experiences with CPET evaluation. Second, all of the participants provided their diagnostic information strictly through self-report. No attempt to understand whether participants would fulfill a criteria-based diagnosis was made as part of this study. These participants are best described as persons who reported a medical diagnosis of ME/CFS and had a physician refer them for ME/CFS specific CPET testing in the community. The current research team has had extensive experience with review of medical records for ME/CFS; the vast majority of diagnoses are made by practitioner gestalt rather than by published diagnostic criteria. These results reflect how PEM is described by persons in the general ME/CFS community. Third, focus groups were conducted over the telephone, making it more difficult for the moderator to control and manage discussions. Some participants may not have fully engaged with the focus group, and at times, discussions went on tangents unrelated to the original query. Despite these limitations, almost all participants contributed substantially to discussions, and the moderator was able, to a large extent, to keep discussions focused and on track. \n\n\n## Implications for Future Research and Clinical Application \n  \nThe current study points to several areas that warrant further exploration. One such area is determining the most effective tools clinicians can provide to patients for managing PEM. Because of the lack of effective treatments for PEM, some ME/CFS researchers have suggested pacing as a therapeutic option to be used by practitioners ( ). Focus group participants in the current study talked at length about the importance of planning and moderation of energy expenditure to avoid PEM, and many described a long period of trial and error before gaining any success with moderating PEM. Although widely discussed in patient forums, this topic has little empirical research and should be studied further. In particular, future research could identify specific pacing regimens that prove most beneficial to specific subtypes of PEM. \n\nThe current study also points to the need for researchers studying PEM in ME/CFS patients to be cognizant of the effects of travel on PEM. For example, patients should arrive several days prior to starting participation to foster recovery from travel. Additionally, it is important to fully understanding a patient's pre-CPET state to accurately assess the effects of the test on PEM symptoms. ME/CFS patients described a fluid baseline, which could change quickly and was difficult to anticipate. Assessments should be performed before the patient travels to get an accurate understanding of the patient's physical, cognitive, and emotional state prior to the experiment. Researchers should also note that PEM induced by CPET differs from daily PEM, and symptoms and timeframes from the experimental setting might not fully correspond with those found in daily PEM. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nME/CFS patients describe PEM as all-encompassing with symptoms affecting every part of the body, difficult to predict or manage, and requiring complete bedrest to fully or partially recover. Through in-depth focus group discussions, ME/CFS patients describe PEM as disruptive to living a self-described \u201cnormal\u201d life, sometimes leading to hopelessness or despair. Given the extensive variability in PEM symptoms and timeframes for onset, peak, and recovery, further research identifying subtypes of PEM could lead to better targeted therapeutic options. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study will not be made publicly available The data are all textual and cannot be provided without breaching confidentiality. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by NIH Combined NeuroScience Institutional Review Board.

The key idea is to base medical decisions on individual patient characteristics, including molecular and behavioral biomarkers, rather than on population averages. Personalized medicine is deeply connected to and dependent on data science, specifically machine learning (often named Artificial Intelligence in the mainstream media). While during recent years there has been a lot of enthusiasm about the potential of \u2018big data\u2019 and machine learning-based solutions, there exist only few examples that impact current clinical practice. The lack of impact on clinical practice can largely be attributed to insufficient performance of predictive models, difficulties to interpret complex model predictions, and lack of validation via prospective clinical trials that demonstrate a clear benefit compared to the standard of care. In this paper, we review the potential of state-of-the-art data science approaches for personalized medicine, discuss open challenges, and highlight directions that may help to overcome them in the future. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThere is a need for an interdisciplinary effort, including data scientists, physicians, patient advocates, regulatory agencies, and health insurance organizations. Partially unrealistic expectations and concerns about data science-based solutions need to be better managed. In parallel, computational methods must advance more to provide direct benefit to clinical practice. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nPersonalized, precision, P4, or stratified medicine is understood as a medical approach in which patients are stratified based on their disease subtype, risk, prognosis, or treatment response using specialized diagnostic tests [ ]. In many publications, the terms mentioned above are used interchangeably, although some authors make further distinctions between them to highlight particular nuances. The key idea is to base medical decisions on individual patient characteristics (including biomarkers) rather than on averages over a whole population. In agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA;  ), we herein use the term biomarker for any measurable quantity or score that can be used as a basis to stratify patients (e.g., genomic alterations, molecular markers, disease severity scores, lifestyle characteristics, etc). The advantages of personalized medicine (summarized in [ ,  ]) are widely considered to be (1) better medication effectiveness, since treatments are tailored to patient characteristics, e.g., genetic profile; (2) reduction of adverse event risks through avoidance of therapies showing no clear positive effect on the disease, while at the same time exhibiting (partially unavoidable) negative side effects; (3) lower healthcare costs as a consequence of optimized and effective use of therapies; (4) early disease diagnosis and prevention by using molecular and non-molecular biomarkers; (5) improved disease management with the help of wearable sensors and mobile health applications; and (6) smarter design of clinical trials due to selection of likely responders at baseline. \n\nAt present, personalized medicine is only an emerging reality. Molecular tumor boards at hospitals are probably furthest in realizing the promises of personalized medicine in clinical practice (Fig.\u00a0 ). At the same time, this example already demonstrates a strong dependency of personalized medicine on computational solutions. Herein, we first explain, how modern approaches from data science, and specifically machine learning, are now beginning to impact personalized medicine. However, the way in which machine learning (often used interchangeably with the term Artificial Intelligence) is presented in the mainstream media often constitutes a hype, which must be contrasted with reality. We identify several challenges that currently constitute hurdles for realizing machine learning-based solutions more broadly in clinical practice. We discuss these challenges together with the existing potential of data science for personalized medicine. Finally, we highlight directions for future development.   \nThe Swiss molecular tumor board as an example of individualized, biomarker-based medical decisions in clinical practice \n  \n\n\n## Data science increasingly impacts personalized medicine \n  \nTo date, the FDA has listed more than 160 (mostly genomic) pharmacogenomic biomarkers ( ) and biomarker signatures (oncology: 33.5%; neurology: 6.1%) that have been approved for stratifying patients for drug response. For example, the anti-cancer drug trastuzumab (Herceptin ) can only be administered if the HER2/neu receptor is overexpressed because the drug interferes with this receptor. Personalized medicine is nowadays thus tightly connected with genomics. However, genomics and other biological high throughput data (transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics) are by no means the only source of data employed in the personalized medicine field. Other relevant data include, for example, bio-images (e.g., MRT and CT scans), electronic medical records (EMRs) [ ], health claims data from insurance companies [ ], and data from wearable sensors and mobile health applications [ ]. \n\nIt is important to mention that, in many cases, it is impossible to identify a single stratification factor or biomarker for patient populations. This is because many diseases (including cancer and various neurological and immunological diseases) are complex and affect a multitude of biological sub-systems. Accordingly, drugs for treating these diseases often target multiple proteins and associated biological processes [ ]. In general, clinical drug response is highly multi-faceted and dependent on a combination of patient intrinsic (e.g., genomic, age, sex, co-medications, liver function) and extrinsic (e.g., alcohol consumption, diet, sunlight exposure) factors [ ]. In conclusion, single-analyte biomarker patient stratification, such as in the Herceptin\u00ae example, is only possible in special cases. \n\nAn alternative to single-analyte biomarkers are multi-analyte signatures derived from complex, high-throughput data, which allow patient characterization in a much more holistic manner than single biomarkers. Identifying marker signatures is difficult and requires state-of-the-art approaches offered by data science. Specifically, multivariate stratification algorithms using techniques from the area of Artificial Intelligence (including machine learning) play an increasingly important role (Fig.\u00a0 ). A highly-cited example is MammaPrint\u2122, a prognostic test for breast cancer based on a 70-gene signature [ ], which was approved by the FDA in 2007. MammaPrint\u2122 produces a score from the weighted average of 70 measured genes, which is predictive for the development of distant metastases. The clinical utility of the addition of the MammaPrint\u2122 signature compared to standard clinicopathological criteria has been recently shown in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy [ ]. Other examples are   Geno2pheno   [ ,  ], which is a computational tool used in clinical practice to estimate the resistance of HIV to an individual drug and to combinatorial therapies based on viral genotype (Fig.  ), and a gene signature (S3 score) for prediction of prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma [ ].   \nDiscovery of biomarker signatures with machine learning \n    \nGeno2pheno - a machine learning based toolbox for predicting viral drug resistance in a personalized medicine paradigm \n  \n\nDriven by the increasing availability of large datasets, there is a growing interest into such data science-driven solutions. Specifically, \u2018deep learning\u2019 techniques have received a lot of attention, for example, in radiology [ ,  ], histology [ ] and, more recently, in the area of personalized medicine [ \u2013 ]. Some of these algorithms have been reported to achieve above-human diagnostic performance in certain cases [ ]. Large commercial players now entering the field underline the widely perceived potential for machine learning-based solutions within personalized medicine ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n## The data science and AI hype contrasts with reality \n  \n### The mainstream media perception \n  \nFrom the previous discussion one might get the impression that enabling personalized medicine is mainly a matter of availability of \u2018big data\u2019, sufficient computing power, and modern deep-learning techniques. Indeed, this perception is portrayed in many mainstream publications, read by decision-makers in politics and industry ( ,  ,  ). In that context, some authors have even claimed the end of classical, hypothesis-driven science and stated that, in the future, all novel insights would come from an algorithmic analysis of large datasets ( ). \n\nSuch statements are overly optimistic and overlook several important aspects, which we discuss below. \n\n\n### Challenge 1: insufficient prediction performance for clinical practice \n  \nMachine learning methods capture and mathematically describe a (complex) signal that is present in a dataset. Their success does not only depend on the number of (patient) samples, but also on the signal-to-noise ratio. Indeed, separation of true signal from technical noise is still one of the key challenges in big data analysis [ ] and one of the key aspects of any computational model. More generally, the prediction performance of any machine learning model is limited per se by the descriptive power of the employed data with respect to the clinical endpoint of interest. For example, EMRs are longitudinal, but largely phenotypic. Thus, molecular phenomena (e.g., non-common genomic variants) that might be relevant to stratifying patients are not sufficiently represented in the data. On the other hand, genomic data is mostly static (at least in non-cancerous tissues) and misses potentially important longitudinal clinical information. For each prediction problem, it is therefore critical to identify and combine the right data modalities that could contain parts of the relevant signal when starting to build machine learning models. Shortcomings can result in loss of prediction performance. Many machine learning models developed for personalized medicine do not have a predictive power close to the high (and potentially unrealistic) expectations of clinicians. Some of the reasons are as follows:   \nThe relationships of patient-specific characteristics to clinically relevant endpoints are highly complex and non-linear, often varying over time and, as mentioned before, typically not well described by one data instance alone. Furthermore, discriminating relevant from irrelevant patient-specific features remains a challenge, specifically in the field of biological high throughput (omics) data. \n  \nIt is challenging to obtain a sufficiently large patient cohort with well-defined phenotypes for training and testing models due to cost and time constraints. \n  \nMany data (e.g., most omics data) are very noisy. There are two sources of this noise. One is technical measurement error (undesired), the other is biological variation (highly informative). We have no good methods for discriminating between these two kinds of noise. \n  \nIt can be challenging to quantitatively and objectively define clinical outcomes (e.g., in neurology, immunology, and psychology). This can lead to highly subjective and physician-dependent variations. \n  \nClinical outcomes may vary over time and be partially influenced by factors that are not patient intrinsic and thus hard to capture (e.g., social and environmental influences). \n  \nA further factor impacting prediction performance is the careful choice of patient samples. Machine learning models are typically sensitive to selection biases, i.e., under- or over-represented specific patient subgroups in the training cohort, and there are currently under-explored ethical considerations at play as well. For example, over- or under-representation of certain ethnicities could result into a \u2018racist\u2019 prediction model [ ]. A proper and careful design of the training set is necessary to ensure that it is representative for the population of patients in the intended application phase of the model in clinical practice. \n  \n\n\n### Challenge 2: difficulties in interpretation \n  \nThe scientific approach, which has been successfully established since the times of Galileo Galilei in the sixteenth century, always encompasses an ongoing process of hypothesis formulation and experimental validation [ ]. While machine learning techniques can detect complex patterns in large data and provide accurate predictions, in general \u2013 we will discuss details later \u2013 they are unable to provide a deeper theoretical, mechanistic, or causal understanding of an observed phenomenon. Data science and AI thus do not replace classical, hypothesis-driven research. One reason is that machine learning models typically only capture statistical dependencies, such as correlation, from data. However, correlation does not imply causation. This is reflected by the fact that a multitude of biomarker signatures yielding similar prediction performance can be constructed to separate the same patient groups [ ]. Even if an acceptable prediction performance can be achieved, the lack of a clear causal or mechanistic interpretation of machine learning models can hinder acceptance of data science-based solutions by physicians. \n\n\n### Challenge 3: insufficient validation for clinical practice \n  \nIt is important to emphasize that establishing any algorithm for patient stratification in clinical practice requires rigorous validation. The quality of the fit of a sufficiently complex machine learning model to the training data (i.e., the training error) is usually highly over-optimistic and not indicative of its later performance on unseen data. A proper validation for clinical practice thus comprises several steps [ ], as follows:   \nInternal validation based on the initial discovery cohort. This can be achieved by setting parts of the data aside as an independent test set or, more frequently, via cross-validation. Cross-validation refers to a strategy in which subsequently a certain fraction (e.g., 10%) of the original data is left out for model testing and the remaining part is used for model training. The cross-validation procedure averages prediction performance over different test sets and thus reduces the variance in test set performance estimates. This is specifically relevant if the overall discovery cohort is not very large. \n  \nExternal validation based on an independent cohort. This is necessary to address the potential selection bias during the compilation of the discovery cohort. \n  \nValidation in a prospective clinical trial to demonstrate the benefit compared to standard of care. \n  \n\nThe entire process is time-consuming and costly. Consequently, the number of clinically validated models is limited. \n\nOverall, the current hype about machine learning and AI in healthcare has to be contrasted with a number of existing challenges, which can be summarized as:   \nInsufficient prediction performance \n  \nChallenges with model interpretation \n  \nChallenges with validation and translation of stratification algorithms into clinical practice \n  \n\nThese challenges lead to the fact that, in contrast to the very high expectations portrayed in the mainstream media, there exist only very few examples of machine learning-based solutions that impact clinical practice (see the examples mentioned above). In the following, we discuss some of these challenges in more detail and point to possible ways of addressing them today and in the future. \n\n\n\n## What is possible today? \n  \n### Machine learning for personalized medicine \n  \n#### Defining better clinical endpoints \n  \nMany methodological as well as applied articles focus on simple yes/no decision tasks, e.g., disease progression / no disease progression or clinical trial endpoint met /not met. This is surprising, because machine learning research offers a comprehensive arsenal of techniques to address clinical endpoints beyond binary classification, such as, real valued, time-to-event, multi-class or multivariate outcomes. Models with binary outcomes can be appropriate in specific situations, but in many cases, an appropriate clinical outcome is more complex. For instance, the commonly used response criterion for rheumatoid arthritis, a debilitating autoimmune disease of the joints, is based on the DAS28 disease score [ ], which ranges on a continuous scale from 0 to 10 and is often discretized into three consecutive levels (low, medium, high disease activity). \n\nThe DAS28 score itself combines four components in a nonlinear equation, namely the number of swollen joints, the number of tender joints, plasma levels of CRP protein, and an assessment of the patient\u2019s global health as estimated by a physician. These components vary from discrete to continuous and from subjective, physician-dependent assessments to more objective measurements of biomarkers. \n\nAnother example is the prediction of response to anti-epileptic drug treatment. While at first glance overall seizure frequency reduction after a given number of weeks relative to baseline seems to be an appropriate endpoint in agreement to common practice in clinical trials, this choice in fact neglects the existence of different seizure types as well as the potential temporal modifications of these seizure types due to treatment. Thus, other and more complex (possibly multivariate) clinical endpoints might be necessary. We expect that a more careful choice of clinical endpoints as well as better technical monitoring capabilities (e.g., via mobile health applications and wearable sensors) will lead to more clinically useful prediction models in the future. \n\n\n#### Defining appropriate model quality and performance measures \n  \nWhat makes a good model in personalized medicine? First, predictions must be accurate. As pointed out above, prediction accuracy must be assessed via a careful validation approach. Within such a validation procedure, it has to be decided how prediction performance will be measured. It appears that, in many studies, too much focus is given to standard, off-the-shelf metrics (e.g., area under the receiver operator characteristic curve), as compared to application-specific performance metrics. For instance, consider the case of predicting response to a first line therapy and assume that we can formulate this question as a classification task (responder vs. non-responder). Clearly, a perfectly accurate classifier is optimal. However, even a classifier that is mediocre with respect to overall accuracy might reliably identify those patients that will definitely not respond to the drug. The identified patients could immediately move on to a second line therapeutic and, thus, patient quality of life would improve and healthcare costs could be reduced. This example demonstrates the relevance of carefully defining appropriate prediction performance metrics. \n\nHowever, prediction performance is only one aspect of judging the overall quality of a model. Another aspect is model stability, which reflects the degree to which a model (including variables selected by that model) remains the same if the training data is slightly changed. Model stability is a particular issue when working with gene expression data, where models trained on very different or even disjoint gene subsets can result in similar prediction performance regarding a given clinical endpoint, since highly correlated features can be substituted for each other [ ]. Model stability should be routinely reported in addition to prediction performance. \n\nVarious methods have been developed for increasing the chance of obtaining a stable model during the development phase of a stratification algorithm. For example, inclusion of prior knowledge, such as biological networks and pathways, can enhance the stability and thus reproducibility of gene expression signatures [ \u2013 ]. Moreover, zero-sum regression [ ] can be used to build classifiers that are less dependent on the employed omics platform (e.g., a specific microarray chip) [ ], thus easing external validation, translation into clinical practice as well as long-term applicability of the model. We think that more frequent use of such methodology in conjunction with careful evaluation of model stability would lower the barrier for model transfer from discovery to external validation and finally to clinical application. \n\n\n#### Tools for interpreting a machine learning model \n  \nAs researchers collect and analyze increasingly larger sets of data, a greater number of sophisticated algorithms are employed to train predictive models. Some of the computational methods, in particular those based on deep learning techniques, are often criticized for being black boxes. Indeed, as the number of input features becomes large and the computational process more complex, understanding the reasons for obtaining a specific result is difficult, if not impossible. In many instances, for example, in the case of identification of disease markers, understanding the computational decision-making process leading to the selection of specific markers is, however, necessary and demanded by physicians. Using black-box models for medical decision-making is thus often considered to be problematic, leading to initiatives like the \u2018right to an explanation\u2019 law Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation propositioned by the European Union in April 2016/679. Similarly, in the process of drug development in pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies require transparency and supporting evidence of a molecular mechanism for the choice of specific biomarker panels. \n\nWhile usefulness of data-driven prediction is increasingly recognized, a key requirement for credibility of such solutions is thus the ability to interpret them in the context of current biomedical knowledge. It is important to understand that the concept of interpretability covers a spectrum (Fig.\u00a0 ). At one end of the spectrum, there is a detailed understanding of the exact (biochemical) molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms that link a model with a defined clinical endpoint. Typically, this level of insight is rarely achievable due to lack of knowledge.   \nDifferent classes of machine learning models and their interpretability via model analysis \n  \n\nA less detailed level of understanding is that of total causal effects of a predictor regarding the clinical endpoint of interest. For example, in a randomized controlled clinical trial, any difference in outcomes between the two treatment groups is known to be caused by the treatment (since the groups are similar in all other respects due to the randomization). Thus, although one may not know exactly how the treatment affects the outcome, one knows that it does. Such statements about total causal effects are more difficult to obtain in a setting outside clinical trials, where purely observational data from untreated patients are collected (e.g., cross-sectional gene expression data). Nonetheless, computational approaches have significantly advanced in this field over recent years and, under certain assumptions and conditions, allow for estimating causal effects directly from observational data [ ,  ]. \n\nAt a lower level of interpretability, gene set and molecular network analysis methods [ ,  ] can help to understand the biological sub-systems in which biomarkers selected by a machine learning algorithm are involved. There also exists a large body of literature on how to directly incorporate biological network information together with gene expression data into machine learning algorithms (see [ ] for a review). \n\nRecently, the concept of \u2018disease maps\u2019 has been developed as a community tool for bridging the gap between experimental biological and computational research [ ]. A disease map is a visual, computer-tractable and standardized representation of literature-derived, disease-specific cause\u2013effect relationships between genetic variants, genes, biological processes, clinical outcomes, or other entities of interest. Disease maps can be used to visualize prior knowledge and provide a platform that could help to understand predictors in a machine learning model in the context of disease pathogenesis, disease comorbidities and potential drug responses. A number of visual pathway editors, such as CellDesigner [ ] and PathVisio [ ], are used to display the content of a disease map and to offer tools for regular updating and deep annotation of knowledge repositories. In addition, dedicated tools such as MINERVA [ ] and NaviCell [ ] have been developed by the Disease Map community. At this point in time, disease maps are more knowledge management rather than simulation or modeling tools, although intensive efforts are underway to develop the next generation of disease maps that are useful for mathematical modelling and simulation and become an integral part of data interpretation pipelines. \n\nThe least detailed level of understanding of a complex machine learning algorithm is provided by the analysis of relative importance of variables with respect to model predictions. Relative variable importance can be calculated for a range of modern machine learning models (including deep learning techniques), but the level of insight depends on whether only few out of all variables have outstanding relevance and whether these variables can be contextualized with supporting evidence from the literature. It is also not clear a priori if such variables are only correlated with or perhaps also causal for the outcome of interest. Finally, inspecting most important variables may be less informative in the case of highly collinear dependencies among predictor variables such as, for example, in gene expression data. \n\nIn addition to the interpretation of predictors there is a need from a physician\u2019s perspective to better understand model predictions and outputs for a given patient. One obvious way might be to display patients with similar characteristics. However, the result will depend on the exact mathematical definition of similarity. Moreover, clinical outcomes of most similar patients will, in general, not always coincide with the predictions made by complex machine learning models, which could result in misinterpretations. The same general concern applies to approaches, in which a complex machine learning model is approximated by a simpler one to enhance interpretability, for example, using a decision tree [ ,  ]. \n\n\n\n### Data type-specific challenges and solutions \n  \n#### Real-world longitudinal data \n  \nLongitudinal EMR and claims data have received increasing interest in recent years within the field of personalized medicine [ ,  ] since they provide a less biased view on patient trajectories than data from classical clinical trials, which are always subject to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria [ ]. Specifically in the United States, a whole industry has grown to collect, annotate, and mine real-world longitudinal data ( ,  /). The recent US$1.9 billion acquisition of Flatiron Health by the pharma company Roche ( ) marks the potential that is seen by industrial decision-makers in the context of drug development, pharmacovigilance, label expansion, and post-marketing analysis [ ,  ]. \n\nLongitudinal real-world data pose specific challenges for training and validation of predictive models. Within the analysis of clinical real-world databases (e.g., Clinical Practice Research Datalink;  ) patients for a study cohort are typically selected based on a specified index date or event, which is often difficult to define and thus leaves room for different choices. Since the maximal observation horizon in real-world databases is often limited to a certain number of years (e.g., due to budget restrictions), some patients are longer observed than others. Specifically, claims data may contain gaps (e.g., due to periods of unemployment of patients) and the exact date of a diagnosis, prescription, or medical procedure cannot be uniquely determined. It is not always clear for the treating physician which ICD diagnosis codes to choose, and this leaves room for optimization with respect to financial outcomes. In addition, EMRs require natural language preprocessing via text mining, which is a difficult and potentially error-prone procedure in itself. In conclusion, development of a predictive model for personalized medicine based on real-world clinical data thus remains a non-trivial challenge. \n\nClassically, validation of a predictive model relies on an appropriate experimental design and randomization. Real-world data often limits the options available for rigorous validation. Classical strategies, such as carefully crafted cross-validation schemes, can offer reliable validation, but they might be tricky to design, and the limits of such retrospective validation must be properly understood. Another option is the use of different time windows where only retrospective data up to a given date is used to develop a model, which is then used on the data available after this date. Such a setup can be close to an actual prospective evaluation, although the risk for biases is larger. Another option is to consider such analyses as only generating hypotheses, which are then followed up in a more classical fashion by setting up a carefully designed observational study manifesting the final validation. A more speculative possibility is the adaptation of so-called A/B testing techniques that are common in web development and software engineering [ ]. This would entail randomization of patients for therapeutic options directly in the real-world environment. While such a setting is probably not feasible for drug development, it may be applicable to determine the efficacy of interventions in a real-world setting or to determine the right patient population for a given intervention. \n\n\n#### Multi-modal patient data \n  \nThere is an increasing availability of multi-scale, multi-modal longitudinal patient data. Examples include the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ) (omics, neuro-imaging, longitudinal clinical data), the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative ( ) (omics, neuro-imaging, longitudinal clinical data), the All-of-Us Cohort ( ) (omics, behavioral, EMRs, environmental data), the GENIE project ( ) (genomic and longitudinal real-world clinical data) and, specifically for multi-omics, the NCI\u2019s Genomic Data Commons [ ]. Multi-modal data provide unique opportunities for personalized medicine because they allow for capturing and understanding different dimensions of a patient. This aspect is in turn widely believed to be key for enhancing the prediction performance of stratification algorithms up to a level that is useful for clinical practice. Accordingly, there has been a lot of work in methods that combine data from different (omics-) modalities, see [ ] for a review. \n\nA major bottleneck in current studies collecting multiple data modalities of clinical cohorts is posed by the fact that different studies are often performed on cohorts of different patients and different experimental approaches are used across studies (see Fig.\u00a0  for an example). As consequence, data from different studies becomes difficult or even impossible to integrate into a joint machine learning model. Several strategies are possible to reduce this problem in the future. A first strategy is to perform systematic multi-modal data assessment of each individual in a clinically rigorously characterized cohort, including longitudinal clinical and omics follow-up. In the more classical clinical setting, the success of the Framingham Heart Study ( ) comes to mind, which is a long-term study about risk factors for cardiovascular diseases running since 1948. While, in the future, we will analyze larger and larger volumes of real-world data, we should be aware of the limitations of such data (interoperability of data from different sources, non-systematically collected data, measurement quality, inconsistencies and errors, etc.). Rigorous multi-modal observational studies are essential for establishing reliable baselines for the development of real-world models. Ideally, multi-modal data would be collected longitudinally in regular intervals for all subjects. While this has been achieved for individual studies [ ], for practical and economic reasons, this is likely to be limited to a small number of cohorts. A second approach is to have some overlap among patients across different cohorts. Statistical methods and machine learning can then be used to \u2018tie\u2019 different datasets together. A third approach is to collect a joint modality (such as standardized clinical data or biomarkers) across different studies. This joint modality again makes it possible to tie together different datasets. It must be stressed that this problem of disconnected cohorts is currently a major obstacle for leveraging multi-omics data.   \nOverlap of different omics data entities and clinical data in the AddNeuroMed Alzheimer\u2019s Disease cohort from EMIF-AD ( ). Numbers refer to patients, for which a particular data modality is available \n  \n\nIt should be emphasized that, ideally, multi-modal, multi-omics data should be considered in conjunction with longitudinal clinical data. Despite of the examples mentioned above (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative, All-of-Us Cohort) we are currently just in the beginning of performing corresponding studies more systematically. The combination of multi-omics with real-world longitudinal data from clinical practice (e.g., EMRs) and mobile health applications marks a further potential for personalized medicine in the future. The GENIE project is an important step into this direction. \n\n\n\n### Translating stratification algorithms into clinical practice \n  \nThe ability to accelerate innovation in patient treatment is linked to our ability to translate increasingly complex and multi-modal stratification algorithms from discovery to validation. Stratification in clinical application means assigning treatment specifications to a particular patient, which may include type, dosage, time point, access to the treatment, and other pharmacological aspects. The validation of such algorithms is usually performed via internal validation (cross-validation), external validation (using a separate patient cohort), and prospective clinical trials compared to the standard of care [ ] ( ). Proper validation constitutes a requirement for translating these methods to settings in which they can generate impact on patient outcomes. In addition to classic healthcare providers, such as hospitals and general practitioner, mobile health applications and wearable sensors might play an increasing role in the future. As described earlier, integrating multi-modal data is key for gaining new insights and lies also at the heart of stratifying patients for diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic purposes. However, considerable barriers exist regarding the integration of similar data from different cohorts, normalization of data across measurement platforms, and the ability to process very large volumes of data in appropriate systems close to or within the clinical infrastructure remains limited. Strictly controlled cloud services, which appropriately protect patient data, could be an approach to alleviating this limitation [ ]. At this point it might be possible to learn from organizations that today handle large scale real-world clinical data (mostly in the US). However, their approaches may have to be adapted to the legal environments in each specific country. \n\nAt present, translation of algorithms for patient stratification into clinical practice is also difficult due to regulatory aspects. Prospective clinical trials required for approval of diagnostic tools by regulatory agencies are very costly and the challenges for finding sponsors are high. One possibility of lowering the associated barriers might be to perform a stepwise approach with initial pilot studies to exemplify the value that can be gained for patients, healthcare sustainability, translational science, and economic efficiency. Such projects would need to showcase the principle value of patient stratification. Moreover, they could provide meaningful insights into disease biology (via biomarkers). These outcomes should ideally be measured longitudinally after machine learning-based stratification and thus provide a feedback loop that helps improve the stratification algorithm. \n\nA commonly stated myth is that health innovation is based on the paradigm of build-and-freeze ( ), which means that software is built, frozen, and then tested in unchanged form for its lifetime. However, development of better stratification algorithms will require a more seamless updating scheme. There have been interesting developments in recent years in terms of regulation and risk management for continuous learning systems. An example of such a development is the Digital Health Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program ( ) launched recently by the FDA. PreCert aims at learning and adapting its key elements based on the effectiveness of the program. In addition, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA;  ) labs provide a template for how health-related software tools developed to inform precision medicine can be validated in a clear and transparent manner as the tool is continually updated. CLIA labs are certified labs that go through a process of regular certifications monitored by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the US. These labs are required to follow approved and documented Standard Operation Procedures. They can use medical devices, which can include software for diagnostics, given that they employ such Standard Operation Procedures and waive the certification process ( ). Most importantly, the developer of the tool can update the software. The CLIA labs are independent in deciding whether they will re-validate the software and can adopt a strategy that best serves the technological pace of the software and their clinical needs with respect to increased capabilities or better performance. For instance, a lab may decide to validate only major version releases, such as going from version 1.x to 2.0, and have minor version releases included on the fly. \n\nThe vision of precision medicine is to provide the right intervention to the right patient, at the right time and dose. The described approaches, based on iterative feedback between the developers and the clinical end users, could increase our ability to adapt stratification algorithms better to new insights in disease biology, access to new molecular data, and changes in clinical settings. This has been a challenge with promising predictive models often failing validation in independent studies. Real-world longitudinal data from clinical practice and data collected through wearables or other means of participatory data collection cannot only widen the spectrum of possible data sources to build new stratification algorithms [ ,  ], but they may also be partially included in clinical trials for validation purposes of stratification algorithms. \n\n\n\n## What could be possible tomorrow? \n  \n### Novel approaches to better link prediction algorithms with biomedical knowledge \n  \nAs discussed earlier, challenges with the interpretation of complex machine learning models are one of the important bottlenecks for applying personalized medicine more widely. Innovative software solutions are needed to better put complex machine learning models and their outputs into the context of computationally accessible knowledge of human pathophysiology. \n\nWhile the current standard is to map the most relevant molecular features in a machine learning model onto biological pathways, this approach could be further enhanced to make machine learning-based decisions interpretable by clinicians. In the future, one might imagine software systems that automatically collect information on each variable from various databases and publications (e.g., via text mining). Such tools could eventually even compose entire reports (including supporting texts and figures of disease maps) for each individual feature in a machine learning model. Such reports could thus automatically contextualize each variable with the multitude of available biomedical knowledge in a fully interactive fashion. The physician could zoom and filter specific aspects of a model on demand. \n\nAnother idea is to visualize entire patient trajectories (originating, for example, from longitudinal clinical trials, real-world clinical or behavioral data) within interactive \u2018disease landscapes\u2019 (essentially low-dimensional data projections). Such a tool could help physicians to understand disease development over time. Taking the patient\u2019s history into account will allow clinicians to visualize and interpret the speed and severity of disease progression. Individual patient trajectories could then be followed and compared to determine, for example, which intervention is appropriate for which patient and at what time [ ]. Similar concepts have been developed in other contexts, e.g. for estimating the in-vivo fitness landscape experienced by HIV-1 under drug selective pressure [ ]. \n\nThe development of such methods and software systems will be a major effort and will likely require a substantial text analytical and software engineering component. However, such systems could greatly facilitate the communication between computational scientists and physicians and help make complex machine learning models more interpretable. \n\n\n### Going from \u2018what\u2019 to \u2018why\u2019 \u2013 towards better interpretable modeling approaches \n  \n#### Causal models \n  \nMachine learning models are typically neither mechanistic nor causal. They largely capture (non-linear) correlations between predictor variables and clinical outcomes and are thus often criticized for being black boxes. The main advantage of modern machine learning approaches is that they neither require a detailed prior understanding of cause\u2013effect relationships nor of detailed mechanisms. The main limitation is the difficulty to interpret them (see previous Section). A major question thus relates to how far machine learning methods could evolve into more causal models in the future. \n\nCausal graphical models (causal Bayesian networks in particular) constitute an established framework for causal reasoning [ ]. They provide a compact mathematical and visual representation of a multivariate distribution, and more importantly, they allow to make predictions of the system under unseen interventions (e.g. a new treatment or a gene knockout). Under appropriate assumptions, causal graphical models can be learned from observational data [ \u2013 ]. In doing so, it is also possible to incorporate background knowledge or to allow for hidden or unmeasured confounders. We refer to [ ] for a review paper. \n\nCausal graph learning methods may play an increasingly important role in the future in identifying predictor variables with causal influence on clinical outcomes [ ] and may thus help to move towards a causal interpretation of predictor variables in a machine learning model [ ]. However, there are non-trivial challenges that need to be addressed, such as dealing with violations of assumptions, high computational costs and non-linear relationships [ ]. \n\n\n#### Hybrid machine learning and mechanistic models \n  \nDespite the increasing availability of massive datasets, the predictive power of most of the available disease models does not yet satisfy the requirements for clinical practice. One of the reasons is that, in principle, predictive disease models must cover all relevant biotic and abiotic mechanisms driving disease progression in individual patients. Although the primary disease-driving mechanisms are often aberrations at the molecular level, such as mutations in the genome, disease progression is affected by the robustness of the overall system. However, biological systems have established a multitude of repair mechanisms to compensate for the effects of molecular aberrations, thus introducing feedback loops and non-linear interactions into the system [ ]. Overall, disease progression is a process affected by a multitude of highly diverse mechanisms across biological hierarchies, which are differently expressed in individual patients. \n\nThus, a disease model, designed for applications in precision medicine in clinics, must in principle integrate three conceptual layers:   \nA core disease model (CDM) represents only the known intra- and inter-cellular processes that are the key drivers of the disease in an average patient. \n  \nThe CDM must be adapted to the individual patient and their specific medical history and environment, such as genetic variations, co-morbidities or physiology, by environment adaption models (EAM). The EAM must provide an individualization of the parameters controlling the CDM, eventually combined with an individualized re-structuring of the CDM, e.g., by adding or dropping biological mechanisms that are relevant only in specific patient populations. \n  \nMonitoring models must be developed to describe how clinically accessible outcome measurements representing the disease evolution are linked to the CDM. \n  \n\nToday, fully mechanistic models exist for a series of disease-driving core processes at the molecular and cell population level [ ]. However, broader application of mechanistic modelling to implement the CDM for complex diseases is hampered by insufficient knowledge of the interaction of the core disease-driving mechanisms across scales. Even worse, the relevant mechanisms for EAM and monitoring models are almost never completely known. Altogether, it thus seems unlikely that fully mechanistic models will play a dominant role in personalized medicine in the near future. \n\nWhile machine learning models are not harmed by insufficient biomedical knowledge, they are often criticized for their black-box character. Hybrid modelling, also named grey-box or semi-parametric modelling, is an integrative approach combining available mechanistic and machine learning-based sub-models into a joint computational network. The nodes represent model components and the edges their interaction. First combinations of mechanistic and data-driven models have been developed for chemical and biotech process modelling [ ,  ]. For example, neural networks have been used to compensate the systematic errors of insufficient mechanistic models, to estimate unobservable parameters in mechanistic models from observable data, or to estimate the interaction between different mechanistic sub-models [ ,  ]. \n\nA further successful example of hybrid modeling comprises learning the drug mechanism of action from data [ ,  ]. Hybrid models may thus be a way to combine the positive aspects of fully mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning models. First showcases have demonstrated the potential, but more successful applications are needed. Moreover, a deeper understanding of the theoretical capabilities of hybrid models as well as their limitations is necessary. \n\n\n\n### Controlling critical transitions in patient trajectories \n  \nOne of the key objectives of personalized medicine is predicting the risk of an individual person to develop a certain disease or, if the disease has already developed, to predict the most suitable therapy. This also includes predicting the likely course of disease progression. Disease trajectories entail all the hallmarks of a complex system. In this sense, modeling disease trajectories is not fundamentally different from attempts to model and simulate other complex systems such as the climatological, ecological, economic or social systems. In many of these highly nonlinear, complex systems with thousands or millions of components, involving redundant and intertwined feedback relations, so called critical transitions or catastrophic shifts can be observed. Such transitions are defined by critical thresholds, sometimes called tipping points at which a system transitions abruptly from one state to another, seem to exist. However, in many of these cases, critical transitions are extremely difficult to predict in advance. \n\nFor certain diseases, we believe that the concept of critical transitions might also be applicable in the context of personalized medicine. Tipping points are often observed during the course of acute or chronic disease development. The ability to predict a critical transition of a developing disease before it really happens would be highly desirable and provide very valuable pre-disease biomarkers. \n\nRecently, Liu et al. [ ] used gene expression analysis to develop the concept of dynamic network biomarkers, where higher-order statistical information is used to identify upcoming tipping points. The idea is that, during the disease trajectory, a subset of genes starts to fluctuate and leads to a destabilization of a (possibly high-dimensional) attractor state. By measuring the changes in gene correlation in addition to changes in the variation of gene expression, a quantitative index was proposed as an early warning signal for a critical transition. \n\n\n### Towards an evolutionary understanding of human disease \n  \nFrom a broader perspective, evolutionary principles could help to improve our understanding of human disease [ ]. Evolutionarily conserved control genes are probably highly relevant for the proper functioning of molecular pathways [ ], and evolutionary history of human disease genes reveals phenotypic connections and comorbidities among some diseases [ ]. We are now at the verge of reconstructing the molecular and cellular circuitry of embryogenesis [ ]. In addition, whole-genome next-generation sequencing efforts of hundreds of thousands and soon Millions of patients with common and rare diseases provide us with a rich genotype\u2013phenotype landscape underlying the development and manifestation of human diseases. Such data provides interesting opportunities to better understand the influence of genomic variants on evolutionarily conserved genomic regions and molecular networks in the context of human diseases. \n\nEvolutionary conservation might be relevant for constraining models and simulating human diseases. Biologically possible and plausible disease trajectories are likely limited by the topological and dynamic upper and lower bounds that are set by the evolutionary history of a disease network. A key challenge for personalized medicine is to come up with a mechanistic explanation of an individual\u2019s disease development. We need to understand the effects of genetic variation on the resulting phenotypic variation. This requires close cooperation between disciplines striving for an integration of the concepts of ontogeny and phylogeny. Human diseases must be seen in the light of evolution and models of human diseases need to integrate data, information, and knowledge from developmental biology and embryology. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the era of growing data volumes and ever shrinking costs for data generation, storage, and computation, personalized medicine comes with high promises, which can only be realized with the help of advanced algorithms from data science, particularly machine learning. Modern machine learning algorithms have the potential of integrating multi-scale, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data to make relatively accurate predictions, which, in some examples, may even exceed human performance [ ]. Large commercial players that are now entering the field of medicine underline the potential that is widely seen for computational solutions. \n\nHowever, the current hype around AI and machine learning must be contrasted with reality. While many prediction algorithms for patient stratification have been published over the last decade, only very few approaches have reached clinical practice so far. Major existing bottlenecks discussed in this paper include the (1) lack of sufficient prediction performance due to a lack of signals in the employed data; (2) challenges with model stability and interpretation; (3) a lack of validation of stratification algorithm via prospective clinical trials, which demonstrate benefit compared to standard of care; and (4) general difficulties to implement a continuous maintenance and updating scheme for decision support systems. \n\nIn addition, general concerns around data privacy as well as ethical and legal aspects must not be overlooked. To overcome these hurdles, an interdisciplinary effort including computational scientists, physicians, patient advocates, regulatory agencies, and health insurance providers is required in the context of a \u2018learning healthcare system\u2019 ( ). There is a need to better manage the (partially unrealistic) expectations and concerns about data science and AI-based solutions. \n\nIn parallel, computational methods must advance in order to provide direct benefit to clinical practice. Current algorithms are far from being able to recommend the right treatment at the right time and dose for each patient. Steps that bring us closer to this goal could be (1) innovative software tools that better link knowledge with machine learning-based predictions from multi-scale, multi-modal, and longitudinal data; (2) innovative modeling approaches, such as causal inference techniques and hybrid modeling, which go beyond typical state-of-the-art machine learning; and (3) new computational modeling approaches that allow us to identify critical transitions in a patient\u2019s medical trajectory. \n\nMore speculatively, a broader understanding of human disease, incorporating findings from basic research and evolutionary studies, might help the creation of entirely new concepts for simulating human diseases and predicting optimal intervention points. Overall, the ambition of research towards personalized medicine should be to move from a system analysis perspective (such as in molecular biology) to a system control view that allows for the planning of optimal medical interventions at the right time and dose on an individualized basis. Novel computational modeling approaches that go beyond the current machine learning methodology may play an increasing role for that purpose. \n\nIn this context, it must be emphasized that no algorithm is meant to replace a physician. Rather, the idea is to provide them a tool at hand, which supports their decisions based on objective, data-driven criteria and the wealth of available biomedical knowledge. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6109989, "text_md5": "52988e05d6491caa3594b8ef3b43dea2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 399], "journal": [400, 407], "publication_year": [409, 413], "title": [424, 489], "keywords": [503, 637], "abstract": [650, 2330], "body": [2339, 55724]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30145981, "doi": "10.1186/s12916-018-1122-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6109989", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6109989"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6109989\">6109989</a>", "list_title": "PMC6109989  From hype to reality: data science enabling personalized medicine"}

The natriuretic polypep-tide b (Nppb)-expressing class of sensory neurons, when activated, elicits scratching responses in mice, but it is unclear which itch-inducing agents stimulate these cells and the receptors involved. Here, we identify receptors expressed by Nppb neurons and demonstrate the functional importance of these receptors as sensors of endogenous pruritogens released by mast cells. Our search for receptors in Nppb neurons reveals that they express leukotriene, serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Targeted cell ablation, calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons, and conditional receptor knockout studies demonstrate that these receptors induce itch by the direct stimulation of Nppb neurons and neurotransmission through the canonical gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-dependent spinal cord itch pathway. Together, our results define a molecular and cellular pathway for mast cell-induced itch. \n   Graphical Abstract  \n\n   In Brief  \nSolinski et al. describe a cellular and molecular pathway that couples mast cell activation to itch behavior. They show that mast cell mediators, serotonin, leukotriene-C4, and sphingosine-1 phosphate directly stimulate Nppb sensory neurons via Htr1f, Cysltr2, and S1pr1 receptors, and this results in itch responses that are elicited through a canonical spinal cord-GRP pathway. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nItch is an irritating cutaneous sensation that leads to the desire to scratch ( ), a system thought to have developed as a means to rapidly remove potentially harmful objects or substances from the skin ( ). To accomplish this protective response, sensory neurons detect cutaneous pruritogens, and these cells relay sensory information via a common and dedicated spinal pathway ( ;  ) to higher centers in the brain, producing an itch percept. \n\nBoth exogeneous compounds (e.g., the protease mucunain present in spicules from the cowhage plant;  ) and endogenous agents released from cells in the skin can trigger pruriception ( ;  ). Skin-resident mast cells are thought to be key players in the latter indirect itch pathway, since they are ideally localized to detect and respond to intruder agents and organisms such as parasites ( ;  ). In the past, work has focused on histamine released by mast cells, for instance in the context of type 1 hypersensitivity reactions ( ). However, mast cells are also activated under nonallergic conditions ( ). Importantly, in most clinically relevant settings, including certain chronic diseases, antihistamines are ineffective at relieving itch ( ;  ), suggesting that molecules other than histamine serve as endogenous pruritogens. However, potential roles of non-histamine mast cell-derived mediators in pruriception are not well characterized, and the neurons and receptors involved in detection of these compounds are also not well understood. \n\nIn mice, pruritogens are detected by two nonoverlapping classes of sensory neurons that themselves are part of a larger population of neurons that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (Trpv1) ( ;  ). One of these classes of neurons is marked by the transmitter natriuretic polypeptide b (Nppb), and the second is defined by the expression of the Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor a3 (Mrgpra3) ( ;  ). It was demonstrated that activation of Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons is sufficient for the generation of itch behavior ( ;  ). Further corroborating a role of Mrgpra3 neurons in pruriception, several itch receptor proteins, including Mrgpra3 itself, the receptor for the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, and Mrgprc11, the receptor for bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8\u201322 and several cysteine proteases, were shown to be expressed by Mrgpra3 neurons ( ;  ), and elimination of these cells attenuated sensitivity to pruritogens ( ). \n\nThe transmitter Nppb is required for itch responses ( ), but it is unclear which itch-inducing agents stimulate Nppb cells and the receptors involved. Interleukin-31 (IL-31), a cytokine associated with chronic itch ( ), might be sensed by Nppb neurons, as they express the IL-31 receptor IL-31Ra ( ). However, IL-31 alone does not provoke acute itch in healthy humans, questioning its role as an endogenous pruritogen ( ). In addition, the serotonin receptor Htr1f was reported to be expressed in Nppb cells, but ablation of these cells partially reduced itch responses to serotonin and other pruritogens, calling into question the contribution of both this receptor and Nppb cells to itch ( ). Lastly, transcriptomic studies suggest that Nppb neurons express select G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that may be involved in itch, but these receptors have not been validated ( ;  ;  ). Thus, to date, it remains unclear how Nppb neurons participate in the detection of pruritogens. To better understand this process, we sought to identify the itch receptors Nppb neurons express and thereby determine the origin of the pruritogens that stimulate these cells. We used an unbiased transcriptomic approach in conjunction with expression studies, calcium imaging, and mouse behavior to define the mechanism by which Nppb neurons couple activation of mast cells to itch. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Mast Cell Activation Induces Itch \n  \nThere are multiple chemicals, with varied sources, that can elicit the sensation of itch. Compounds from mast cells ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) are regarded as a class of endogenous pruritogens; for instance, histamine is widely used in rodent itch behavioral tests ( ;  ). However, although mast cells are thought to cause itch, the release of chemicals from them has not been studied in detail because of challenges in solely activating these cells. This is because the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor Fc\u03b5RI, whose ligation causes degranulation, is expressed on several cell types in addition to mast cells ( ). Additionally, mediators that can cause IgE-independent mast cell degranulation have been shown to directly activate sensory neurons, raising doubts about the specificity of this group of agonists   in vivo   ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, to characterize the contribution of mast cells to itch in more detail, we examined, using a targeted genetic approach, the behavior caused by stimulation of these cells. The strategy we employed utilized the mast cell-specific Cre-recombinase driver mouse line mast cell protease 5 (Mcpt5)-Cre (MCCre), together with the Cre-dependent R26-LSL-hM3Dq line ( ;  ). This permitted the expression of the GPCR, hM3Dq, only in mast cells. hM3Dq is an artificial receptor that has been widely employed to stimulate cells using the synthetic ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a compound that does not activate endogenous GPCRs ( ). To confirm the specificity of this strategy, we crossed MC-Cre animals with the Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line Ai9 ( ). As expected, we found very high co-localization between tdTomato reporter expression and mast cells in the skin (290 of 304 cells double labeled;  ). Further, we found almost complete co-expression between hM3Dq and mast cells that was strictly dependent on the expression of Cre (557 of 644 cells double labeled;   and  ). If activation of mast cells causes itch, then we would anticipate that intradermal administration of CNO should induce scratching. Exactly as expected, mice injected with CNO into the nape of the neck exhibited scratching responses toward the injected area, demonstrating that activation of mast cells is sufficient to provoke itch behavior. In contrast, Cre-negative control littermates failed to exhibit scratch responses when challenged with CNO ( ). These results suggest that the activation of mast cells likely leads to the release of agents, and this is sufficient to evoke itch behavior. \n\n\n### Nppb Neurons Express Potential Pruriceptive GPCRs \n  \nAlthough some of the receptors for compounds released by mast cells are known ( ;  ), it is unclear if there are additional itch receptors for less well-characterized chemicals. Therefore, we designed a screen to search for potential receptors. Because Nppb and Mrgpra3 cells have been shown previously to be responsible for itch in mice and when stimulated can elicit scratching responses ( ;  ;  ), we hypothesized that there might be unidentified itch receptors expressed in these populations of neurons. We further hypothesized that additional receptors might be differentially expressed between these two classes of cells because the Mrgpra3 and Mrgprc11 itch receptors are expressed preferentially by Mrgpra3 neurons ( ). Since both Nppb and Mrgpra3 cells co-express the Trpv1 ion channel ( ;  ), we examined the genes expressed in Nppb cells, taking advantage of Sst-Cre mice, which permit the genetic labeling of Nppb neurons, ( ), and compared them with genes expressed in Trpv1 neurons, thereby allowing us to search for receptors expressed in these two populations of cells. \n\nIn order to sample all (or close to all) genes expressed in these cells, we generated cDNA libraries from RNA collected from ~200 hand-picked labeled neurons (see   for details). Four independent Sst  and four Trpv1  cDNA libraries were generated, sequenced, and subsequently compared. As expected, and confirming that the transcriptomes of Sst and Trpv1 cells differ significantly from each other, hierarchical clustering of transcriptome data showed that the largest determinant for difference between samples was cell type ( ). Comparison of data from Sst and Trpv1 samples revealed ~1,600 genes with significant differences in gene expression between cell types ( ; EdgeR, p < 0.05). Almost 1,000 genes were expressed ~2-fold higher in Sst compared to Trpv1 samples, and ~600 genes were enriched in Trpv1 versus Sst libraries ( ). From these lists of genes, we choose to focus our attention on GPCRs, since many pruritogens are detected by this class of receptors ( ;  ;  ) ( ). \n\nConsistent with our postulate and with previous reports ( ), the itch-related GPCRs Mrgprc11, Mrgpra3, Mrgpra1, and Mrgpra9 were enriched in Trpv1 libraries relative to Sst libraries ( ). While the specific expression of multiple receptor molecules in Mrgpra3 cells has been functionally linked to pruritogen-evoked scratching responses ( ,  ), the receptor repertoire for Nppb neurons is still incompletely understood. Therefore, we next concentrated our attention on the GPCRs enriched in Nppb cells and identified 18 candidate GPCRs ( ). Based on the GPCRs enriched in Nppb neurons, we sought to directly determine if mediators for some of these receptors are released by mast cells. We used peritoneal-derived mast cells (PDMCs), which have frequently been used to model skin mast cells ( ), to examine some of the substances they release upon stimulation.   shows that after PDMC stimulation, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), in agreement with previous reports ( ;  ;  ), are released, suggesting that these agents may be involved in mast cell-dependent itch via activation of their cognate receptors in Nppb neurons. \n\n\n### Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 Elicit Itch via the Spinal Cord-GRP Pathway \n  \nSince we found that the release of LTC4, serotonin, and S1p from mast cells is correlated with mast cell-induced itch behavior, we focused our attention on the receptors for these compounds (Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1). For these receptors to be involved in itch, the intradermal injection into the nape of the neck of specific ligands for them, would be expected to induce scratching. Indeed, exactly as anticipated, all of these compounds elicited vigorous scratch responses ( \u2013 ). The rodent cheek behavioral assay permits the distinction of itch from nociceptive responses, with pruritogens evoking scratching with the hindlimb while algogens trigger wiping with the forelimb ( ). In contrast to the wiping evoked by capsaicin, N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 produced intense scratching and did not elicit wiping, suggesting that these agents are pruritogens (  and  ). \n\nItch responses have been shown to be transmitted through a spinal cord circuit that requires the neuropeptide gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and GRP neurons ( ;  ). This circuit has been shown to be specific for itch, and therefore, to obtain evidence that the Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 are pruriceptors, we tested if itch responses evoked by them are dependent on signaling through spinal cord-GRP neurons. To accomplish this, we used a targeted genetic strategy where we interfered with the biosynthesis of neuropeptides, including GRP, in spinal cord-GRP neurons. Specifically, we generated mice lacking the critical neuropeptide-modifying enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) in GRP-Cre neurons ( ), GRP-Cre\u2237PAM  mice (PAM-mice) ( ). PAM is the sole enzyme responsible for C-terminal deglycination and amidation of peptides, a common modification of many neuropeptides including GRP ( ). In the absence of modification by PAM, GRP has two orders of magnitude less potency for its receptor than the amidated peptide ( ,  ;  ). We note that the resulting PAM mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios and displayed no overall gross phenotype. Confirming successful elimination of PAM from GRP neurons, we were only able to amplify the mutant PAM allele (with Cre-mediated deletion of exon 6) from cDNA derived from the spinal cord samples from PAM mice ( ). Further, as expected for interference with spinal GRP signaling, histamine-, chloroquine-, and compound-48/80-induced itch was profoundly reduced ( ,  , and  ), while responses to other somatosensory stimuli were unaffected by this mutation ( \u2013 ;  ;  ). Additionally, itch induced by intrathecal administration of GRP and injection of nor-Binaltorphimine were unaffected, consistent with the PAM genetic lesion only affecting signaling upstream of spinal cord GRPR neurons and not effecting other GRP neurons in the CNS (  and  ;  ;  ). Thus, PAM mice are an effective genetic method to test if compounds are involved in itch. To investigate if the GRP-dependent spinal circuit is required to evoke itch responses for ligands to Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, we performed experiments with PAM mice. We hypothesized that if these receptors are required for itch, then spinal cord-GRP signaling would be required. Just as expected, itch behavioral responses mediated through Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 were strongly attenuated in PAM mice compared to littermate controls ( \u2013 ). \n\n\n### Trpv1-Lineage Neurons Are Necessary for Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-Evoked Itch \n  \nOur findings that Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-induced itch-responses require spinal-GRP signaling suggest that they are itch receptors. A corollary of this result is that the elimination of the sensory neurons, which express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, should attenuate itch responses induced by the agonists for these receptors. To address this predicted consequence, we used animals that have lost the Trpv1 lineage of sensory neurons ( ) by crossing Trpv1-IRES-Cre animals ( ) with a R26-floxed stop-diphtheria toxin A (DTA) line ( ) to produce Trpv1-Cre\u2237LSLDTA mice (Trpv1-DTA). In agreement with previous reports ( ), we found that these mice have deficits in behavioral responses to the Trpv1 agonist capsaicin as well as in the detection of noxious heat and cold ( \u2013 ). We verified histologically that Trpv1-DTA mice lack sensory neurons expressing Trpv1 and Nppb ( \u2013 ) ( ). Strikingly, Trpv1-DTA mice also exhibit severely reduced scratching responses to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 ( \u2013 ), indicating that these neurons are required to produce Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 itch responses. However, even though Trpv1-lineage neurons are required for N-met LTC4-, LY344864-, and CYM5442-induced itch, this reaction may result via a deficit in an indirect itch pathway, e.g., via mast cells ( ). To test this possibility, we examined itch responses in mice lacking mast cells. Specifically, to ablate mast cells, we crossed MC-Cre\u2237LSL-tdTomato mice with the R26-floxed stop-DTA line (MC-DTA). Histochemical staining of skin from MC-DTA animals showed that they had no detectable mast cells ( ; 0 mast cells in 7 sections from 3 mice). MC-DTA mice displayed itch responses indistinguishable from littermate control animals, showing that scratching induced by N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 does not require mast cells ( \u2013 ). \n\nA second prediction of Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 being itch receptors is that application of their corresponding ligands should stimulate the neurons in which they are expressed. Since Trpv1-lineage neurons are required for itch responses mediated by these receptors, the cells that express these receptors must be within this population of neurons. Therefore, we performed calcium imaging on DRG neurons collected from mice where the Trpv1 lineage of cells expresses the calcium sensor GCaMP6s, Trpv1-Cre\u2237Ai96 mice ( ). Since this cell lineage contains multiple different classes of cells, not all of which are involved in itch ( ;  ), sensory neurons were sequentially exposed to N-met LTC4, LY344864, CYM5442, histamine, and capsaicin to determine cellular specificity. With this testing regimen, we could classify neurons that express histamine and capsaicin (Trpv1) receptors and determine the neurons that were responsive to ligands for Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1. As expected, calcium imaging revealed a class of non-itch neurons that were stimulated by capsaicin but were unresponsive to all the pruritogens tested (  and  , middle). Imaging also revealed two different classes of neurons that reacted to pruritogens. The first of these reacted to histamine and capsaicin but was unresponsive to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 (  and  , left). The second class of neurons displayed largely overlapping responsiveness to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 as well as to histamine and capsaicin (  and  , right). \n\n\n### Nppb Neurons Co-express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 \n  \nOur transcriptomic data show that Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 are enriched in Nppb-cells ( ), ablation experiments demonstrate that Trpv1-neurons are required for itch mediated by these receptors, and cellular imaging assays establish that a subpopulation of Trpv1-neurons responds to the ligands for these receptors ( ), suggesting that Nppb-neurons co-express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1. Recently, it was reported that Cysltr2 and Htr1f are found in Nppb-neurons ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, the extent of overlap in expression of these receptors with Nppb was not examined nor was the co-expression of receptors with each other and with other cell types determined. Therefore, to understand more about the neurons that express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, we performed triple-label   in situ   hybridization (ISH) using probes to individual receptors, Nppb, and Trpv1. Virtually all Cysltr2-positive neurons express Nppb-Trpv1 (87.2% \u00b1 2.8%; 266 neurons from 17 sections/3 animals), and similarly, almost all Htr1f-positive and S1pr1-positive cells express Nppb-Trpv1 (86.3% \u00b1 6.3%; 199 neurons from 12 sections/3 animals and 98.9% \u00b1 1.3%; 89 neurons from 8 sections/3 animals), demonstrating a remarkably tight co-expression of these receptors in Nppb cells ( \u2013 ). \n\nThe co-expression of Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 in Nppb neurons predicts that these neurons should be activated by agonists for these receptors. To address this, we performed calcium imaging of primary DRG neurons derived from mice where the majority of Nppb neurons express the calcium reporter GCaMP6s, Sst-Cre\u2237Ai96 mice ( ;  ). As predicted from the co-expression of Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, almost all Sst-Cre\u2237Ai96 neurons responsive to capsaicin and histamine also responded to N-met LTC4 (7/11 cells), LY344864 (13/16 cells), and CYM5442 (5/7 cells) ( \u2013 ). These results suggest that Nppb neurons are a largely homogeneous population of cells that react to multiple pruritogens. \n\nOur functional imaging experiments revealed that Nppb neurons are activated by histamine as well as N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 (  and  \u2013 ). However, comparison of the transcriptomes of Nppb and Trpv1 neurons did not reveal differential expression of histamine receptors between these classes of cells. We wondered if this might be because histamine receptor is expressed in both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons. To better characterize these two classes of neurons, we determined that they are both predominantly small diameter and that Nppb neurons are 7.5% \u00b1 0.7% and Mrgpra3-cells are 8.4% \u00b1 2.8% of DRG cells ( ; 5,059 Tubb3  neurons) ( ). Next, to determine if Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons express histamine receptor, we performed ISH for the histamine receptor Hrh1 and compared its co-expression with Nppb and Mrgpra3. Interestingly, results from triple-label ISH revealed that Hrh1 is expressed by both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons (93.3% \u00b1 0.8% of Nppb  cells and 73.4% \u00b1 2.3% of Mrgpra3  cells; 1,644 and 1,185 neurons, respectively), as well as by an additional smaller population of cells (9.1% \u00b1 1.4% of Hrh1  cells negative for Nppb and Mrgpra3; 286 neurons) (  and  ). Together, these results demonstrate that while Nppb and Mrgpra3 cells have distinct repertoires of itch receptors, they both express histamine receptors. \n\n\n### Direct Activation of Nppb Neurons by S1p Induces Itch \n  \nResults from analysis of gene expression, calcium imaging, ISH, and behavioral experiments strongly support Nppb neurons being sensors of mast cell-induced itch and substantiate Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 as itch receptors. To obtain further   in vivo   validation that these receptors are itch sensors, we focused our attention on whether S1pr1 is essential for S1p-induced itch. In order to do this, we generated a mouse null for S1pr1 in only sensory neurons, Trpv1-Cre\u2237 S1pr1  mice (S1pr1 cKO) ( ). As S1pr1 is expressed only in Nppb neurons ( ), this intersectional approach enabled the specific deletion of S1pr1 in Nppb-expressing neurons. We reasoned that if S1pr1 functions   in vivo   as an itch receptor, then a sensory-neuron-specific knockout (KO) of this GPCR should produce mice lacking itch responses to S1p (CYM5442).   illustrates the genetic strategy employed to eliminate expression of S1pr1 in sensory neurons. Notably, S1pr1 cKO mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios, and ISH experiments demonstrated a complete lack of specific S1pr1 staining in homozygous KO animals (  and  ; 0 S1pr1  cells on 13 sections/3 mice). The loss of S1pr1 did not affect the expression of Nppb and Trpv1 (  and  ; control versus S1pr1 cKO mice 32.2 \u00b1 9.8 versus 29.7 \u00b1 12.4 Trpv1  cells, p = 0.6927, and 16.2 \u00b1 4.1 versus 12.7 \u00b1 6.1 Nppb  cells, p = 0.2577). We next investigated if S1pr1 cKO mice have sensory deficits, testing several acute somatosensory behaviors. No differences between mutants and controls were observed for behavioral responses to noxious heat, noxious cold, and innocuous mechanical stimuli or for motor coordination, itch responses to histamine and chloroquine, and ongoing nociceptive responses after intraplantar injection of capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate, showing that the S1pr1 is not required for these behaviors ( ). Responses to N-met LTC4 and LY344864 were also normal in mutant mice (  and  ). By contrast, scratching responses to intradermal injection of the S1pr1 agonist CYM5442 were virtually absent in S1pr1 cKO mice ( ). These results demonstrate that CYM5442-evoked itch requires the direct activation of S1pr1 in sensory neurons. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, using chemogenetics, transcriptome sequencing, calcium imaging, ISH, and selective genetic manipulations, we define a pathway by which itch is induced by mast cell activation. First, chemogenetic activation of mast cells produces itch behavior. Second, we show that mast cells, upon stimulation, can release serotonin, LTC4, and S1p. Third, we demonstrate that receptors for these three ligands are expressed selectively by Nppb neurons. Fourth, genetic disruption of spinal cord GRP-neuron neuropeptide-mediated itch establishes that Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-induced scratch responses require the canonical GRP-spinal cord itch circuit. Fifth, calcium imaging results corroborate that Nppb neurons directly respond to agents released by mast cells. Lastly, we engineered and tested mice specifically lacking S1pr1 in sensory neurons, showing that these mice selectively lose itch responses to S1p. Together, our studies establish a cellular and molecular mechanism by which mast cell activation induces itch. \n\nThere has been much interest in identifying and characterizing receptors responsible for itch sensation in the last decade ( ;  ). Itch receptors include the GPCRs Mrgprc11, a receptor for Bam8\u201322 and activated by cysteine proteases ( ;  ); Mrgpra3, a receptor for chloroquine ( ); Mrgprd, a receptor for b-alanine ( ); Htr7 and Htr2b, receptors for serotonin ( ;  ); S1pr3, a receptor for S1p ( ) and the protease-activated receptors (PARs) 2 and 4 ( ,  ;  ), as well as non-GPCR itch receptors, including IL-31Ra, thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR), TLR7, and IL-4Ra ( ;  ;  ;  ). Here, we identify and functionally characterize three additional itch receptors, Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, that are specifically co-expressed in Nppb neurons. In addition to these three GPCRs, our transcriptomic analysis of Nppb neurons ( ) revealed the existence of other receptors that might modulate Nppb-neuron activity. For instance, we found the serotonin receptors Htr7, Htr1a, and Htr1d to be enriched in Nppb neurons relative to Trpv1 neurons, some of which were previously reported to contribute to itch ( ). Furthermore, our sequencing results suggest that the platelet-activating factor receptor (Ptafr) is also likely expressed in Nppb neurons. Interestingly, the platelet-activating factor lipid moiety was described to be produced by mast cells ( ), hinting that it may be involved in mast cell-mediated itch as well. The large number of identified receptors suggests that there is redundancy in pathways for induction of itch, and almost all pruriceptors described so far have been reported to be coupled to Trpv1 and/or Trpa1 ion channels. It has also been described that the direct activation of Trpa1 can evoke itch in different animals ( ). Nevertheless, it is likely that itch and pruriceptors developed to respond to specific dermatological challenges. Additionally, even though agonists to the proposed itch receptors reported here evoke itch responses in experimental settings, they may not all have primary roles in itch detection. \n\nThe Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 group of receptors we identified is co-expressed in a population of neurons that express the neuropeptide transmitter Nppb ( ), while Mrgpra3 itch neurons express a different class of itch receptors but do not express Nppb, insinuating that there is specialization between these cell types. A caveat to this partition of itch receptors is the common expression of the histamine receptor Hrh1 (and other itch receptors; data not shown) by both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons ( ). Additionally, we previously showed that deletion of Sst from sensory neurons can impact behavioral responses to the Mrgpra3 agonist chloroquine ( ), indicating functional cross-talk between both groups of itch neurons. Future studies should resolve if there is itch-cell specialization between Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons and an analysis of genes expressed by these cells ( ) may provide a means to better address this question. \n\nWe employed a mutation in a critical enzyme in the maturation pathway for neuropeptides to disrupt the GRP-itch circuit in the spinal cord ( ;  ,  ;  ). The elimination of the PAM enzyme in GRP-Cre-expressing cells produced a specific defect in itch for all of the itch-inducing agents we tested, including histamine and chloroquine, while leaving responses to all other somatosensory modalities tested normal (  and  ). This highly selective effect on itch is similar to that seen when GRPR signaling was manipulated previously ( ;  ;  ). Compared to many other neural circuits, the striking feature of the itch pathway is its reliance on neuropeptides ( ;  ;  ;  ). This contrasts with the contribution of neuropeptides in other somatosensory synaptic signaling pathways where neuropeptides are thought to have modulatory effects and their loss produces only modest deficits in animal behavior ( ;  ). The difference in timing and duration of itch sensation compared to other somatosensory modalities might be a result of this difference in neurotransmission. \n\nThe results we present in this study focus on acute itch responses evoked by injection of pruritogens or the chemogenetic activation of mast cells. The mechanisms underlying itch responses for both are likely similar to those which occur for normal itch responses, for instance after an insect bite. However, the agents we identified in this study are unlikely to be the only compounds that are released by mast cells and induce acute itch. For instance, mast cell-derived proteases are known to activate PARs, thereby inducing scratching responses ( ). In addition to a role in mast cell-mediated acute itch, the endogenous ligands we characterized here may also be involved in persistent itch conditions. High levels of circulating S1p have been reported to be associated with psoriasis ( ), and similarly, elevated LTC4 is associated with skin inflammation, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis ( ). Furthermore, platelet-activating factor antagonist was reported to produce some relief in patients with itch caused by atopic dermatitis ( ). These lipid mediators, in addition to being released by mast cells, may be released by keratinocytes or other types of immune cells. Collectively, these studies suggest that S1pr1 and Cysltr2 in Nppb neurons, in addition to having roles in acute itch produced by mast cell activation, may also contribute to some forms of chronic itch. \n\nMast cells are thought to be immune sentinels that survey the skin for intruders. Classically, their function is believed to involve the detection of invading parasites and the recruitment of other immune cell types via paracrine signaling ( ;  ). It was also known that the release of some agents from mast cells leads to the sensation of itch. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism by which mast cell activation produces sensory nerve stimulation by identifying ligands and several receptors responsible for this coupling. These results highlight a mechanism by which neural and immune systems cooperate to provide a unified defense of the skin and offer insights into the potential ways by which this cascade may become dysfunctional during chronic itch. \n\n\n## STAR\u2605METHODS \n  \n### CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING \n  \nFurther information and requests should be directed to the Lead Contact, Mark Hoon ( ). Reagents will be distributed in accordance with the rules and procedures of the National Institute of Health. \n\n\n### EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS \n  \n#### Animals \n  \nAll experiments using mice followed NIH guidelines and were approved by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ACUC. Mice were housed in small social groups (4\u20135 animals) in individually ventilated cages under 12-hour light/dark cycles and fed   ad libitum  . 6\u201310-week old animals of both genders were used in all experiments. C57BL/6N wild-type mice were purchased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) and all other genetically modified mice were bred in house. Sst-IRES-Cre knock-in ( ), Trpv1-IRES-Cre knock-in ( ), GRP-Cre BAC-transgenic ( ) and Mcpt5-Cre BAC-transgenic ( ) mice that drive expression of Cre recombinase in genetically identifiable cell populations have been described previously. These Cre-driver lines were crossed to conditional alleles, as described throughout the text, to enable the Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato (Ai9) ( ), GCaMP6s (Ai96) ( ), hM3Dq-mCitrine ( ), or DTA ( ) from the R26 locus. The LSL-hM3Dq-mCitrine allele was targeted for integration into the R26 locus but, as established by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), it integrated elsewhere in the genome without affecting functionality of the receptor. Trpv1-IRES-Cre animals were also bred to a floxed S1pr1 allele ( ), allowing a conditional deletion of S1pr1 in sensory neurons. Pam mice (Pam ) were obtained from EuMMCR ( ) and crossed with FLP deleter mice (B6N.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sor /J) to obtain PAM  mice. GRP-Cre BAC-transgenic mice were bred to PAM  mice to conditionally delete PAM in GRP-expressing spinal cord neurons. Genotyping of offspring from all breeding steps was performed with genomic DNA isolated from tail snips and allele-specific primer pairs (see  ). \n\n\n\n### PRIMARY CELL CULTURES \n  \nPrimary cultures of DRG neurons were generated from Trpv1-Cre\u2237Ai96 and Sst-Cre\u2237Ai96 mice of both genders. DRG were dissected and dissociated as described previously ( ). Briefly, DRG were harvested and incubated in 5 mg/mL Collagenase/Dispase (10269638001, Millipore-Sigma) for 30 minutes. Cells were mechanically dissociated and seeded on poly-D lysine-coated coverslips and cultured for 48 hours before the experiment (DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, 100 ng/mL NGF, 50 ng/mL GDNF). \n\nPrimary cultures of peritoneum-derived mast cells (PDMC) were prepared as described previously ( ). Briefly, mast cells were isolated by peritoneal lavage from C57BL/6N mice of both genders and cultured for two weeks in medium (DMEM, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mg/ml gentamicin) containing IL3 (20 ng/ml) and SCF (30 ng/ml). \n\n\n### METHOD DETAILS \n  \n#### RNA-sequencing \n  \nSst-IRES-Cre and Trpv1-IRES-Cre pups at P2 were intraperitoneally injected with AAV9-CAG-Flex-eGFP or AAV9-CAG-Flex-tdTomato (10 \u03bcL, 1\u00d710  vg/mL). From these mice, DRG neurons were acutely dissociated as described previously ( ). Between 150\u2013250 eGFP- or tdTomato-positive cells per mouse were hand-picked. Each picking session included one sample per genotype to potentially identify experimentally induced biases. A total of 4 independent samples per genotype were generated. Total RNA was extracted with a PicoPure RNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was produced and amplified using the Ovation\u00ae RNA-seq system V2 (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) according the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Nextera XT method (Illumina, San Diego, CA), pooled and sequenced in 126 bp paired-end mode on a HiSeq 1000 instrument (Illumina). Data was demultiplexed, trimmed and mapped to the mouse genome GRCm38 using star ( ). Read counting was performed with featureCounts ( ) and only genes with at least 1 read in 3 out of 4 replicates were further analyzed. Differential gene expression was assessed with EdgeR ( ) and genes with p < 0.05 were included in downstream analyses. Hierarchical clustering of samples was performed with Morpheus (Broad institute, Cambridge, MA) using the settings \u201cOne minus Pearson correlation\u201d and \u201clinkage method complete\u201d. GPCRs in the set of differentially expressed genes were identified using gene ontology. Expression differences in this GPCR gene set were visualized as a heatmap using Morpheus. Prior to plotting, row median reads were subtracted from raw reads and subsequently divided by the row median absolute deviation, to enhance the visibility. \n\n\n#### ISH \n  \nDRGs were dissected from mice with various genotypes. Multi-labeling ISH was performed using the RNAscope\u00ae technology (ACD, Newark, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Probes against Trpv1, Nppb, Mrgpra3, Tubb3, Hrh1, Htr1f, Cysltr2, and S1pr1 in conjunction with the RNAscope\u00ae multiplex fluorescent development kit were used. Images were collected on an Eclipse Ti (Nikon, Melville, NY) confocal laser-scanning microscope. Soma size was determined with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). \n\n\n#### Mast cell staining in the skin \n  \nEar skin from MC-Cre\u2237LSL-tdTomato, LSL-hM3Dq, MC-Cre\u2237LSL-hM3Dq, and MC-DTA mice was fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformalde-hyde (PFA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 2 days, embedded in Tissue-Tek\u00ae O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cut on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) at 20 mm. Slides were warmed at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes before fixing sections for 10 minutes in 4% PFA. Sections were blocked (10% normal goat serum in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100) for 2 hours at room temperature. Mast cells were visualized by incubation with avidin-FITC (1:500 in blocking solution, Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) for 60 minutes and three subsequent washing steps in PBS. In some cases, mast cell visualization was combined with immunohistochemical staining for hM3Dq-mCitrine. Here, sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (A6455, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100. Mast cell visualization was then performed during incubation with the donkey-anti-rabbit-Cy3 secondary antibody (711-165-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at a 1:200 dilution in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100. All sections were coverslipped in Fluoromount G with DAPI (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and imaged on an Eclipse Ti (Nikon) confocal laser-scanning microscope with appropriate filter sets. Co-localization of FITC- and tdTomato/Cy3-dependent fluorescence was analyzed with ImageJ. \n\n\n#### Calcium Imaging \n  \nAfter 48 hours of culture, coverslips with primary DRG neurons were mounted on a DMi8 microscope (Leica, Allendale, NJ) in HBSS buffer (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl , 10 HEPES, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl , pH 7.4) and constantly super fused from a gravity-fed six-channel system (VC-6, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Imaging was done with an ORCA-Flash 4.0 C1440 digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) at 1 Hz. Fluorescence intensity in hand-drawn regions of interest was extracted using HCImage (Hamamatsu) and plotted against time. Raster plots to visualize population responses were produced in R ( ). \n\n\n#### Reverse Transcription-PCR \n  \nSpinal cords from PAM  and GRP-Cre\u2237PAM  mice were dissected and total RNA extracted using a RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. During RNA extraction, on column DNase treatment was performed. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA) and oligo(dT) 18 primer according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. As a control, mock reactions lacking reverse transcriptase were performed and used as no template control during PCR. Cre-recombined PAM transcripts (for primer: CACTGGGAGTTACTGGTGTTGGAT, rev primer: TAAGGACACACCGGAACAGTCTT) or b-actin transcripts as a control (for primer: CTGGCTCCTAGCACCATGAAGATC, rev primer: CTAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACG) were amplified by PCR using a Phusion\u00ae hot start flex polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and detected on 2% agarose gels. \n\n\n#### ELISA of PDMC supernatants \n  \nAfter two weeks in culture and before stimulation with compound 48/80 (50 \u03bcg/ml), cells were washed twice in growth factor-free medium and 1.5 \u00d7 10  (for quantification of LTC4 and serotonin release) or 1.5 \u00d7 10  (for quantification of S1p release) cells were seeded in round-bottom 96-well plates. Release of LTC4 (501070, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), serotonin (ADI-900\u2013175, Enzo Life Sciences, East Farmingdale, NY) and S1p (CEG031Ge, Cloud-Clone Corp., Katy, TX) were measured in supernatants using competition ELISAs according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n\n#### Mouse behavioral measurements \n  \nFor all behavioral paradigms, the experimenter was blind to the genotype of mice under study. Ear-tag numbers were read after the experiment and results were unblinded at the end of testing sessions. All behavioral experiments were conducted during the light cycle at ambient temperature (~23\u00b0C). Behavioral assessment of scratching behavior was conducted as described previously ( ). Briefly, mice were injected subcutaneously into the nape of the neck with histamine, chloroquine, compound 48/80, LY344864 (all Millipore-Sigma), nor-Binaltorphimine, CYM5442 (both Tocris, Minneapolis, MN), CNO (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or N-met LTC4 (Cayman Chemical). Compounds were diluted in PBS except CYM5442 which was diluted in dH O. Higher doses of CNO led to anaphylaxis-like reactions, most likely because of the systemic dispersion of highly lipophilic CNO. Therefore, we limited the CNO dose we employed in our studies to prevent anaphylaxis and consequently the conditions we used may not have produced fully activated mast cells. In a separate experiment, GRP was injected intrathecally. Scratching behavior was recorded for 30 minutes and is presented in bouts per 30 minutes. One bout was defined as scratching behavior toward the injection site between lifting the hind leg from the ground and either putting it back on the ground or guarding the paw with the mouth. Injections of LY344864, CYM5442, N-met LTC4 and capsaicin in the mouse cheek itch/pain model were performed as described previously ( ). Injection volume was always 10 \u03bcl. \n\nAblation of Trpv1 lineage neurons was functionally verified by testing the sensitivity of mice toward application of capsaicin onto the cornea as described previously ( ). Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of a 50 \u03bcM capsaicin solution were applied onto the cornea and wiping behavior was counted for 30 s. Responses to heat were tested as described previously with minor modifications ( ). Hind paws of mice habituated in small plastic enclosures on a plantar test instrument (Ugo Basile, Gemonio, Italy) were stimulated with a radiant heat beam and time to withdrawal was measured. Withdrawal was tested 5 times for each hind paw, consecutive tests of the same paw were separated by at least 3 minutes. Cold responses were tested as described previously ( ). Briefly, a dry ice pellet was applied below the hind paw of a mouse sitting on a glass surface and time to withdrawal was measured. Withdrawal was tested 5 times for each hind paw, consecutive tests of the same paw were separated by at least 3 minutes. Mechanical sensitivity thresholds were assessed using calibrated von Frey filaments employing the simplified up-down method ( ). Motor coordination was tested by measuring the performance on an accelerating rota-rod, as previously described ( ). Each mouse performed the task 3 times and the rod speed at failure was averaged. Ongoing spontaneous pain responses were quantified by counting paw flinches for 15 or 30 minutes after intraplantar injection of capsaicin or allyl isothiocyanate, respectively. \n\n\n\n### QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS \n  \nPrism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analyses. Differences between mean values were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test when two groups were compared or 1-way analysis of variances with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons post hoc test when more than two data groups were compared. Differences were considered significant for *p < 0.05. Exact p values, definition and number of replicates as well as definitions of center and dispersion are given in the respective figure legend. No statistical method was employed to predetermine sample sizes. The sample sizes used in our experiments were similar to those generally used in the field. \n\n\n### DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY \n  \nThe RNaseq datasets generated in this paper have been deposited with GEO under ID code GSE125626. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6490177, "text_md5": "82b2c126bee5bdeff50ebbca028d9cfe", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 166], "journal": [167, 175], "publication_year": [177, 181], "title": [192, 242], "keywords": [256, 256], "abstract": [269, 1762], "body": [1771, 44143]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30917312, "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.089", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6490177", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6490177"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6490177\">6490177</a>", "list_title": "PMC6490177  Nppb Neurons Are Sensors of Mast Cell-Induced Itch"}
{"text": "Auslander, Noam and Wolf, Yuri I. and Koonin, Eugene V.\nProc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nIn silico learning of tumor evolution through mutational time series\n\n# Keywords\n\ncancer progression\ndriver mutations\npassenger mutations\nmachine learning\nneural networks\n\n\n# Abstract\n  Significance  \nCancer is caused by the effects of somatic mutations known as drivers. Although a number of major cancer drivers have been identified, it is suspected that many more comparatively rare and conditional drivers exist, and the interactions between different cancer-associated mutations that might be relevant for tumor progression are not well understood. We applied an advanced neural network approach to learn the sequence of mutations and the mutational burden in colon and lung cancers and to identify mutations that are associated with individual drivers. A significant ordering of driver mutations is demonstrated, and numerous, previously undetected conditional drivers are identified. These findings broaden the existing understanding of the mechanisms of tumor progression and have implications for therapeutic strategies. \n  \nCancer arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations over time. Understanding the sequence of mutation occurrence during cancer progression can assist early and accurate diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. Here we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a class of recurrent neural network, to learn the evolution of a tumor through an ordered sequence of mutations. We demonstrate the capacity of LSTMs to learn complex dynamics of the mutational time series governing tumor progression, allowing accurate prediction of the mutational burden and the occurrence of mutations in the sequence. Using the probabilities learned by the LSTM, we simulate mutational data and show that the simulation results are statistically indistinguishable from the empirical data. We identify passenger mutations that are significantly associated with established cancer drivers in the sequence and demonstrate that the genes carrying these mutations are substantially enriched in interactions with the corresponding driver genes. Breaking the network into modules consisting of driver genes and their interactors, we show that these interactions are associated with poor patient prognosis, thus likely conferring growth advantage for tumor progression. Thus, application of LSTM provides for prediction of numerous additional conditional drivers and reveals hitherto unknown aspects of cancer evolution. \n \n\n# Body\n \nTumorigenesis is a multistep process characterized by accumulation of somatic mutations, which contribute to tumor growth, clinical progression, immune escape, and the development of drug resistance ( ,  ). The somatic mutations found in a tumor cell are accumulated over the lifetime of the cancer patient, so that some mutations are acquired in early steps of tumorigenesis and even in premalignant cells ( ). Relatively small subsets of these mutations are established tumor drivers, whereas the remainder are thought to be passengers that do not confer growth advantage or may even negatively affect tumor fitness ( \u2013 ). Although molecular and cell biology studies have revealed many mechanistic details of tumorigenesis ( ,  \u2013 ), our understanding of the tumor evolution dynamics remains limited, presumably due to the complexity of the process and the abundance of passenger events that could be randomly distributed but might exert various effects on tumor fitness and properties ( ,  ). \n\nIn colorectal cancer, tumor development has been explained by a multistep model of carcinogenesis that describes the progression of a benign adenoma to a malignant carcinoma through a series of well-defined histological stages that are linked to a mutational time series, i.e., the temporal sequence of occurrence of driver mutations ( \u2013 ). Similar stepwise models have been developed for other types of adenocarcinomas ( ,  ), although the temporal succession of molecular changes characterizing the progression of these tumors has not been elucidated at the level of confidence it has for colon cancer ( ). Given that the somatic alterations in some tumors can be represented as a multistep sequence of events, we conjectured that time series learning algorithms could be applied to the sequence of somatic mutations, potentially revealing the complex dynamics of the tumor evolution and enabling a variety of context-specific predictions. \n\nTo this end, we employed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks ( ), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) ( ) capable of learning long-term dependencies in a time series sequence. These networks have achieved major success in time series prediction tasks and for learning evolution of recurrent systems ( ,  \u2013 ). We demonstrate here the utility of applying LSTM to time-ordered mutational data in colon and lung adenocarcinomas. We define a pseudotemporal gene ranking, representing each tumor sample as a binary text, which can be used for training LSTM in a similar manner to that applied in natural language texts classification ( \u2013 ). Applied to a discrete version of the mutational data, ordered into an approximate temporal sequence, these networks can be used to predict the mutational load from a limited number of mutations and for stepwise prediction of the occurrence of following mutations in the series. Using the sequence dynamics learned by the models, we reconstruct sequences of mutations that are statistically indistinguishable from the original observations. We find that the occurrence of distinct subsets of mutations could be predicted from the timeline of the major cancer drivers. Investigation of the driver genes contributing to the prediction of each of these mutations uncovers numerous driver\u2013interactor gene pairs that are highly and specifically enriched with different types of independently identified interactions. We further derive modules of driver genes and find that their predicted interactions are associated with poor survival rate, suggesting that the driver and associated passengers jointly promote tumor growth. \n\n## Results \n  \nThroughout this work, we use a discretized version of the mutational data from two tumor types, namely, colon cancer, where the stepwise evolutionary model has been established ( \u2013 ), and lung cancer, where such a model has been suggested but not widely accepted as it is in the case of colon cancer ( ,  ). The snapshot mutational datasets are ordered into an approximate temporal sequence that is estimated via the training sets for each tumor type. For each classification task, we trained LSTM networks using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( ) time-ordered mutational data for these tumor types and tested the network performance using independent datasets ( ). \n  \nDatasets used for training and testing, for colon and lung adenocarcinomas \n  \n### Predicting Tumor Mutational Load from the Mutational Time Series. \n  \nWe aim to represent tumor mutations as a discrete timeline of mutational events such that the appearance of a mutation in the timeline would correspond to their estimated place in the tumor evolution. We thus calculate a score for every mutation as the ratio of its occurrences in the presence and in the absence of other mutations (see   for details). This form of the score is motivated by the assumption that mutations that appear late in the tumor evolution are more likely to be fixed when other mutations are present, supported by a previously established notion that cooccurring events more often take place at late stages in tumor evolution ( \u2013 ). Sorting the mutations by the scores evaluated on our training datasets, we find that this estimated order of mutation appearance is in agreement with the established succession of the key drivers in colon adenocarcinoma ( ). In particular, the APC mutation is an early driver event, followed by CTNBB1, KRAS, and SMAD4, whereas PIK3CA and TP53 mutations occur later in tumor development ( ,  ). Moreover, we find that the scores significantly correlate with the ratio between the frequency of a mutation in colon adenomas and its frequency in colon carcinomas [from COSMIC database ( ,  );  ], further supporting the relevance of this score for the inference of the order of mutations. \n\nWe then used the time-ordered mutational data to predict the overall mutational load in the respective tumors and evaluate the number of mutations required for an accurate prediction. To this end, we trained LSTM networks aiming to predict high vs. low mutational load ( ) from a time series of mutations. Given a discrete time series of mutation occurrences, the LSTM network is trained using the series up to a time   and is applied to the left-out test to produce scores that reflect the probability of each sample in the test to have a high mutational load. Starting from the final time point (the last mutation in the series, likely occurring late in the tumor evolution), we find that prediction of the mutational load saturates with high performance (AUC > 0.95) with fewer than 100 mutations for both colon and lung adenocarcinomas ( ). The sets of genes that contribute to the mutational load prediction significantly overlap between colon and lung cancers (  P   value \u2248 0 for the last 100 genes). Notably, this overlap includes genes that encode some of the longest human proteins that perform various organizing roles in either intracellular or intercellular interactions, such as titin (TTN), mucin-16 (MUC16), and nesprin-1 (SYNE1). TTN is one of the most commonly mutated early drivers in colon cancer ( ). MUC16 is implicated in the progression of several cancers, apparently, via interactions with the immune system, and is emerging as an important target for cancer therapy ( ). SYNE1, a cytoskeleton organizer, although less thoroughly characterized, appears to contribute to DNA damage response and, thus, to genome instability and tumorigenesis ( ). Thus, the genes that contribute to mutation load prediction in both types of cancer seem to reveal common biological themes. Moreover, the scores assigned by the LSTM using only the 20 latest mutations (i.e., the 20 mutations with the highest order scores) as a sequence are highly correlated with the observed mutational load in all test sets ( ). Using the time series from the earliest time point, however, results in almost random prediction performance with similar number of mutations ( ), suggesting that the ultimate mutational burden of a tumor depends primarily on mutations that occur late in tumor evolution. Training linear classifiers to predict the mutational load from the same sequences of mutations or randomly selected mutations ( ) resulted in significantly inferior performance compared with the LSTM ( ), suggesting that the LSTM networks learn complex dynamics within the mutational data that could not be captured by conventional classification approaches. \n  \nPrediction of tumor mutational load from the mutational time series. (  A  ) The test AUCs (  y   axis) obtained for training LSTMs on different lengths of mutation sequences (  x   axis) when starting from the latest ordered mutation, for colon and lung test sets. (  B  \u2013  D  ) Correlation between the score assigned by LSTMs with the 20 latest mutations in the time series (  x   axis), and the true mutational load (  y   axis, log transformed). (  E  \u2013  G  ) Spearman correlation between the scores assigned by different learning models and the observed mutational load (  y   axis) when using different number of mutations from these that are ordered latest in the sequence (up to 50 mutations,   x   axis). The dashed lines show the results for classifiers trained on randomly selected mutations (rather than the ordered sequence of mutations that is shown by solid lines). (  H  \u2013  K  ) Scores assigned by LSTM using the last 20 mutations for colon cancer patients with different clinical characteristics. (  L  ) PFS of lung cancer patients in the test set, of samples assigned with high vs. low (using the median) scores with the last 20 mutations. COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma. \n  \nThe scores assigned to predict the mutational load are also associated with clinical phenotypes. For the colon cancer test sets, the scores assigned by LSTM trained with the 20 latest mutations in the sequence are significantly higher in samples of primary tumors assigned with poor grade vs. moderate grade, in high vs. low microsatellite instability, and in high vs. low CpG island methylation phenotypes ( ). In the lung cancer test set, higher scores are associated with lower progression-free survival (PFS;  ). \n\n\n### Predicting Occurrence of Mutations in the Sequence and Simulated Data Analysis. \n  \nWe then explored the possibility of predicting the occurrence of mutations in the course of tumor evolution from other mutations in the time series. To this end, the LSTM networks were trained to predict the occurrence of each mutation   in the time series, using the time series of mutations from the latest mutation up to the   mutation (thus predicting earlier mutations from later ones). The occurrence of most mutations in the sequence could be predicted with good accuracy, with the median AUC = 0.88, 0.73, and 0.69 for the first and second colon test sets and for the lung test set, respectively ( ). Mutations for which occurrence could not be predicted (AUC < 0.5; 2 and 17% of the mutations in colon and lung cancers, respectively) were significantly less common than those that were readily predictable (rank-sum   P   value = 0.001 for colon and 2.4e-106 for lung;  ), implying that the occurrence of these low-frequency mutations is not linked to tumor progression. \n  \nPrediction and generation of the sequence of mutations. (  A  ) Histogram of mutations count (  y   axis) for each performance level (AUC;   x   axis) for mutation prediction in a sequence for colon cancer test sets (pink and purple bars for test sets 1 and 2, respectively) and for lung cancer test set (green bars). (  B  ) Mean AUC of mutation prediction in the sequence for the two colon test sets: comparison of drivers with all other genes. (  C  ) AUC of mutation prediction in the sequence for the lung test set: comparison of drivers with all other genes. (  D   and   E  ) Scatter plots of PC1\u2013PC3 obtained by PCA applied to the combined mutational data from all datasets used and the simulated samples, for colon and lung cancers, respectively. The percentage of variance explained by each PC is indicated in parentheses. (  F   and   G  ) Presence\u2013absence patterns for the high-frequency cancer drivers in the reconstructed mutational samples (red) and the TCGA mutational data (blue) for colon and lung cancers, respectively. The samples are ordered by the hierarchical clustering results, with the Euclidean distance metric and average linkage. \n  \nMore unexpected than the poor prediction for low-frequency mutations, the prediction accuracy for mutations in known cancer driver genes was significantly lower than that for mutations in all other genes, in both tumor types ( ). This observation is maintained when including only genes that are frequently mutated ( ). These findings indicate that the driver mutations that determine the course of tumorigenesis could not be readily predicted from the rest of the mutational landscape of a given tumor type. In contrast, many passenger mutations tend to be linked to specific drivers ( ) and thus could be predicted with confidence. Notably, however, the subset of driver mutations for which good prediction accuracy was achieved included DNA repair genes, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH for colon cancer and DDX5 and CHD1L for lung cancer, conceivably due to their effect on other mutations in the sequence ( ). \n\nRecently, it has been shown that LSTM RNNs can be used to generate complex sequences by simply predicting one data point at a time ( ). We hence reasoned that similar technique could be utilized to generate the mutational time sequence and thus could be employed for mutational data reconstruction. We used the LSTM scores to predict the occurrence of each mutation in the time series (from the latest to the earliest), to determine the occurrence of one mutation at a step in a simulated time series (see   for details). In this manner, we reconstructed 100 mutational samples for colon cancer and 100 samples for lung cancer ( ). The K-means clustering analysis did not separate the simulated data from the real data ( ), and principal component analysis (PCA) showed notable similarity between the simulated datasets and the real ones ( ), which is maintained when considering only frequently mutated genes ( ). This similarity was observed also when using the tSNE dimensionality reduction method ( ) ( ). Considering the patterns of occurrence of the frequently mutated cancer drivers (those with the frequency of mutation in the top 10%) in the simulated data, we identified clear similarities to the observed patterns in the original data, such as the mutual exclusion of APC, KRAS, and TP53 in colon cancer and of KRAS and MGA in lung cancer (  and  ). \n\nTo evaluate the effect of the actual order of the mutations in the sequence function on the prediction of the preceding mutations, we repeated this analysis for the 300 last mutations, in both colon and lung cancers, after randomly permuting the order of mutations in the sequence up to each predicted mutation (10 random permutations for each prediction task). The comparison of the results with those obtained with the original, ordered sequence of mutations shows a dramatic drop in the prediction accuracy (paired rank-sum   P   value < 0.06, 0.02, and 9e-6 for colon test set1, colon test set 2, and lung test set, respectively;  ). This is a strong indication that the actual order of mutations is important for predicting the mutational sequence. \n\n\n### Predicting Associations Between Major Cancer Drivers and Other Genes. \n  \nGiven that most mutations are predicted with high accuracy from the time sequence, we investigated the possibility that some mutations (currently classified as passenger) might also be predicted from the ordered time sequence of mutations in cancer driver genes which play key roles in tumor development. Mutations that might be predicted through their association with major cancer drivers are of obvious interest because they could potentially contribute to different aspects of tumorigenesis. To explore such potential associations, we selected well-characterized, major cancer drivers in each tumor type studied (  n   = 42 for colon and   n   = 26 for lung;  ) and utilized the discrete time series of their occurrences to predict the occurrence of other mutations. This analysis yielded 354 genes for colon cancer and 273 genes for lung cancer in which mutations could be predicted robustly with high AUC from multiple points in the time series of the major drivers (  and  ). \n\nGiven that these mutations are accurately predicted using a short mutational sequence that includes only the major drivers, we hypothesized that the respective genes interact with these drivers. To further characterize the potential functional connections between the major drivers and the identified associated genes, we first determined which driver contributed to the prediction of each of the identified driver-associated mutations ( ) to generate a list of driver\u2013interactor pairs for colon and lung cancers (  and  ). A STRING interactions enrichment analysis ( ,  ) ( ) showed that for 68 and 39 predicted driver\u2013interactor pairs in colon and lung cancers, respectively, the interaction is validated under the multiple criteria implemented in STRING (hypergeometric   P   value \u2248 0 and 5.2675e-04 for colon and lung, respectively). When the major cancer drivers were analyzed individually, we found significant (  P   value < 0.05) STRING enrichment between about 22% of both colon and lung cancer major drivers and their predicted interactors, a result that is unlikely to be obtained by chance ( ; permutation   P   value < 0.001 for both colon and lung). \n  \nSTRING-validated interactions of major drivers in colon and lung cancers. (  A   and   B  ) Heatmaps showing, for each major colon and lung cancer driver, respectively, the number of STRING interactions within the mutational data (first row), the number of predicted interactions (second row), the number of interactions in the intersection (third row), and the log-transformed hypergeometric   P   value (fourth row). (  C   and   D  ) The networks of STRING-validated interactions for colon and lung cancers, respectively. \n  \nThe node degrees of the major cancer drivers in the network of STRING-validated interactions vary substantially within the networks inferred for each tumor type and differ between the colon and lung networks for shared drivers, with the mean degree of 3.5 for colon and 3 for lung ( ). In both networks, SMAD4, a gene encoding a protein involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway ( ), is highly connected. Most of the genes connected with SMAD4 in these networks are also involved in TGF-beta signaling, but the specific subsets of these genes differ between the colon and lung networks. Several of these interactions have been reported previously. In particular, MAP2K4 has been identified as a conditional tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinomas but not in colon cancer ( ), whereas mutations in HIF1A are associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer ( ); furthermore, HIF1A protein physically interacts with SMAD4 under hypoxic conditions in colon cancer cell lines ( ). The degree of TP53 is considerably higher in the lung cancer network than in the colon cancer network, possibly due to different TP53 mutants that are observed in these tumors ( ) that have different interacting partners ( ). Notably, in both the colon and the lung networks, TP53, SMAD4, ATM, and NF1 belong to the same strongly connected network module, whereas major tumor-specific cancer drivers such as APC (colon) and EGFR (lung) are disconnected. \n\nNext, we systematically assessed whether the predicted interactors of the major cancer drivers are involved in the same or similar processes with the corresponding drivers. Using GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment ( ,  ), we find that for both colon and lung cancers, all major drivers share a significant (with hypergeometric   P   value < 0.05) overlap of the sets of GO processes with their predicted interactors ( ). This level of enrichment in shared processes is unlikely to be reached by chance (permutation   P   < 0.001 for both colon and lung). \n  \nGO enrichment of the predicted interactions of major cancer drivers. (  A   and   B  ) The gray bars show the fraction of GO processes associated with each major cancer driver that are significantly shared with its predicted interactors, for colon and lung cancers, respectively. The dot plots show the percentage of overlap of GO processes between each major driver and its predicted interactors (the red bar shows the mean of this distribution). (  C  ) Heatmaps for GO processes enriched with the shared colon and lung major drivers and their interactors (presented are the interactors that are most strongly associated with these GO processes; for full information, see  ). \n  \nFor the 13 major drivers that are shared between colon and lung cancers, we identified 1,119 GO significantly enriched processes (enrichment   P   value < 0.01;  ). For the predicted interactors of these major drivers, 240 GO processes are highly enriched in the case of colon cancer, and 229 processes are highly enriched for lung cancer. Of these, 133 GO processes are shared between the interactors from colon and lung cancers (hypergeometric   P   value \u2248 0), and among them, 34 GO processes are shared with the set of processes enriched among drivers (hypergeometric   P   value = 0.02;   and  ). Among the GO processes that are shared between these major cancer drivers and their interactors are cell motility pathways, regulation of cell development, differentiation and growth factor stimulation, and mesenchyme development processes. It appears plausible that the predicted interactions of diverse genes with the major drivers promote tumor growth and aggressiveness through the modulation of those processes. \n\n\n### Driver\u2013Interactor Modules Are Associated with Patients\u2019 Survival. \n  \nWe next investigated the bipartite network of major drivers and their predicted interactors. In an attempt to infer the contributions of these interactions to tumor fitness through patients\u2019 survival, we first sought to identify modules of major drivers that share interactors. To this end, we performed a heuristic search for driver modules, aiming to cover the maximum number of drivers in each tumor type. Specifically, we searched for the maximum partition of each tumor graph into disjoint subgraphs, such that each subgraph is complete (more precisely, the relation between the modules of drivers and interactors is complete; see   for details). In colon cancer, we identified 3 mutually exclusive modules of drivers (with mutually exclusive pairwise interactions), which together cover 22 of the 23 major colon cancer drivers with predicted interactions (all but the DCC gene), and 47 interactors ( ). For each module, we then identified the TCGA colon samples in which the given module is highly mutated (see   for details). We performed Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis comparing the survival curves between samples with high vs. low number of mutations of the predicted interactors within each module, conditional on the drivers in the respective module being highly mutated. Strikingly, we found that the high mutation rate of interactors of each of the three modules is associated with poor survival when the driver component of the module is mutated ( ). For some of these shared interactors, we also find that individual mutations are significantly associated with lower survival rate in the context where their driver module is highly mutated ( ). Among these, SIX4 expression has been shown to correlate with lymph node metastasis and late stage and unfavorable prognosis of colorectal cancer ( ), and PBX3 mutations have been identified in colorectal tumor cells undergoing epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis ( ). \n  \nModules of drivers and interactors in colon cancer. (  A  \u2013  C  ) The complete networks of interactions between modules of major colon cancer drivers (modules I\u2013III, respectively) and their predicted shared interactors. (  D  \u2013  F  ) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves of TCGA colon cancer samples with high mutation rate of drivers modules I\u2013III, respectively, with high vs. low number of mutation in the interactors of these modules (defined by the median). (  G  \u2013  I  ) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves of TCGA colon cancer samples with vs. without mutations in individual interactors of these modules. \n  \nFor the lung adenocarcinoma mutational data, we detected two mutually exclusive modules of drivers (with mutually exclusive pairwise interactions) that together cover 10 of the 18 major lung cancer drivers with predicted interactions, with 47 interactors of these drivers ( ). Similarly to the observations on colon cancer, a high number of mutations in the interactors of each driver module is associated with poor survival in samples where the corresponding drivers are mutated ( ) and with lower PFS ( ). For four of the predicted interactors of module 1 (but none for module 2), we also find that some of the individual interacting mutations are significantly associated with lower survival rate when drivers from this module are mutated ( ). One of such interactors is EPN1, an Epsin family member shown to regulate tumor progression ( ). \n  \nModules of drivers and interactors in lung cancer. (  A   and   B  ) The complete networks of interactions between modules of major lung cancer drivers (modules 1 and 2, respectively) and their predicted shared interactors. (  C  \u2013  F  ) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves of TCGA colon cancer samples (overall survival;   C   and   E  ) and the lung cancer test set samples (PFS;   D   and   F  ) of samples with high mutation rate of driver modules I and II, respectively, with high vs. low number of mutation in the interactors of these modules (defined by the median). (  G  ) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves of TCGA colon cancer samples with high mutation rate of driver module I (defined by the median), with vs. without mutations of individual interactors of module I. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nMost epithelial cancers are preceded by premalignant lesions, which frequently display mutations in cancer driver genes ( \u2013 ). Nevertheless, early and late events are not universally characterized in most epithelial tumors, with the exception of colorectal cancer, where tumor progression has been thoroughly dissected in terms of stepwise accumulation of somatic mutations. This phenomenon starts from transformation of normal epithelium to an adenoma, proceeding to in situ carcinoma and ultimately to invasive and metastatic tumor, where specific mutations mark each step in this tumorigenic transformation ( ,  ). It is hence reasonable to surmise that time series prediction approaches could be valuable when applied to the sequence of these genetic events in tumors. \n\nRNNs, and particularly gated RNN architectures such as LSTMs, have recently shown promising results in learning long-term dependencies of sequences for multiple tasks of classification ( ,  ) and for data labeling and synthesis ( ,  ). Here we show that the mutational time series could be utilized via LSTM networks to achieve good performance in otherwise difficult prediction tasks. Using the estimated order of mutations appearance in tumor evolution, we demonstrate that end point conditions, such as the mutational burden and clinical phenotypes, could be predicted from a limited number of mutations. The nonlinear relations learned by the networks, together with the discrete representation of the data, enable performance that is significantly superior to the previous models built for this task ( ,  ). The model can learn intricate dynamics of the mutational sequence in tumor evolution that can subsequently be used for the reconstruction of mutation sequences. When more data become available and the relevant neural network models are further refined, similar approaches could be applied to reconstruct data on actual DNA sequences and could thus extensively contribute to our understanding of tumor evolution. It is worth pointing out that applications of LSTMs generally take advantage of much larger data for training because in these, the input alphabet as well as possible labels are from a much larger range, thus substantially increasing the size of the dataset required for training. In our analysis, discretizing the mutational data and maintaining discrete labels (i.e., both input size and labels are always of size 2) generates a simple enough problem that can be approached even with limited amounts of data ( ). We also found that LSTMs perform much better than linear classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), for the prediction of the mutational load. This is likely to be the case because LSTMs learn nonlinear relationships between mutations in the given sequence, rather than defining a linear separating hyperplane, with the underlining assumption that the mutational load can be predicted using a linear function of mutations. \n\nA potentially important contribution of this approach is the identification of interactors of the major cancer drivers. Here we predict many such interactors and show that they are significantly enriched with STRING interactions and show nonrandom overlap of GO processes with the corresponding major drivers. Anecdotally, at least some of the better characterized interactors were found to be involved in the same pathway with the corresponding driver. In contrast, we find that the predicted interactors of each drivers are not located on similar chromosomal arms ( ), suggesting that these are mostly functional, rather than physical interactions. Furthermore, and most strikingly, we found that mutations in these predicted interactors, in the presence of the corresponding driver mutations, are associated with poor survival and, thus, are likely to confer growth advantage at the respective steps of tumor progression. We identified unique modules of major drivers and their interactors for both colon and lung cancer. The strong correlation with patients\u2019 survival suggests that these interactions are clinically relevant and, if further tested, could potentially be used for patients\u2019 stratification and clinical decision-making. The identified interactors can be regarded as secondary drivers whose oncogenic activity is conditional to and associated with the occurrence of mutations in major drivers for the respective cancer types. Hence, these conditional drivers could be readily predicted notwithstanding the low accuracy of prediction for most of the major drivers themselves. \n\nTo summarize, in this work, we present the application of LSTM for learning the stepwise sequence of mutations in tumors. This approach is shown to efficiently tackle several tasks that are not amenable to standard techniques, such as prediction of the occurrence of mutations and reconstruction of mutational data. Our findings reveal a unidirectional relation between driver and passenger mutations: drivers determine the course of tumorigenesis, and their occurrence is difficult to predict from the rest of the mutational landscape, whereas passengers are often linked to specific drivers and so can be predicted with confidence. Thus, drivers are indeed in the driver\u2019s seat and bring with them a host of associated passengers, some of which could be secondary, conditional drivers. The present results support the notion that long-term dependencies between genes involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression are widespread in tumor evolution and can be learned from the mutational sequence using LSTM networks and similar approaches. We show that this notion holds for colon cancer, where the stepwise process of mutation acquisition is established, but also for lung cancer for which such a stepwise model has been suggested but remains controversial. Similar strategies could be readily employed for other tumor types and different types of biological data to advance our understanding of tumor initiation and progression through the dissection of the sequence of evolutionary events. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Mutation Data. \n  \nMutational data of colon and lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA were used for training throughout this work and were obtained from Xena browser ( ). Datasets used for testing were obtained from cBioPortal ( ,  ). The datasets are summarized in  , spanning 1,626 samples overall, each derived from a distinct tumor. \n\n\n### Driver Mutation Lists for Lung and Colon Cancers. \n  \nThe union of driver genes obtained from ( ) and ( ) was used for lung and colon cancers ( ). \n\n\n### Preprocessing and Sorting Mutational Data. \n  \nTo generate the binary sequence of mutations, we first discretize the mutational data assigning 1 for each nonsynonymous mutation. For each cancer type, we then consider all genes that are mutated at least once in all datasets used (totals of 12,322 and 12,327 mutated genes for colon and lung cancer, respectively). \n\nTo sort the mutations of colon and lung adenocarcinoma by their estimated temporal order, we evaluate the following function for each TCGA training dataset: \n\nwhere   if sample   has a mutation in gene  . We calculate the order score for each considered gene using the TCGA datasets that are used for training and use that score to sort the test datasets. Order scores calculated using the test datasets were found to significantly correlate with that derived from the training set for both colon and lung cancers ( ). \n\n\n### LSTM Machines. \n  \nEach LSTM network unit defines a time   in a sequence (the subscript   t   denotes the mutation that is ordered   in the tumor evolution via the order score defined above), and is composed of the following components: \n\nwhere the initial values are   and  .   denotes the Hadamard product. \n\n are the input vectors to the LSTM unit (an ordered sequence of mutations).  , and   are the activation vectors for the forget gate, input gate and output gate, respectively.   is the output vector of the LSTM unit, and   is cell state vector.   and   are the weight matrices, and   represents the bias matrices that are learned during training.   represents the nonlinear functions, where   is the gate activation, sigmoid function  , and   is the state activation,   (hyperbolic tangent) function, . \n\nAll LSTM networks used in this work are sequence-to-label LSTMs with five hidden layers and were trained using Adam optimizer ( ), where the maximum number of epochs for training was set to 100 for the mutational load prediction and to 10 for all other prediction tasks. The minibatch size used for each training iteration was set to 27, with a standard gradient-clipping threshold set to 1. \n\n\n### Training LSTMs to Predict the Mutational Load. \n  \nWe train LSTMs for the sequence up to each time point when starting once from the mutation ordered last, and second from the mutation ordered first in the sequence. The two-categorical labels   are defining low (0, <median) vs. high mutational load (1, >median). For each time point  , an   is trained on the training set using the sequence up to   and is then applied to the test set to predict the mutational load using the time sequence of mutations up to  . For each time point  , the resulting scores are used to evaluate the performance via two measures: (  i  ) the   resulting from an ROC curve, predicting the low vs. high categories in the test, and (  ii  ) the Spearman rank correlation coefficient   between the   scores that are assigned to each test sample and the actual mutational load of the sample. \n\n\n### Training KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression Classifiers to Predict the Mutational Load. \n  \nKNN (with K = 5), SVM (using linear kernel), and logistic regression classifiers were trained on the training sets using (  i  ) sequences of the latest ordered mutations that were used as input to the LSTMs and (  ii  ) sequences of 50 randomly selected mutations. These were trained to predict low vs. high mutational load as described for the LSTMs and applied to the test sets, and the resulting classification scores were correlated with the true mutational load via Spearman rank correlation. \n\n\n### Training LSTMs to Predict the Occurrence of Succeeding Mutations in the Time Sequence. \n  \nTo predict the occurrence of a mutation ordered   in the sequence, we train LSTM for the sequence starting from the mutation ordered last up to time point   using the training sets and test their performance for predicting these occurrences in the test sets, where the two-categorial labels   are defining the occurrence of the mutation. \n\n\n### Training LSTM Networks to Simulate Mutational Data. \n  \nTo synthesize mutational data, we use the full mutational data for each cancer type. We reconstruct 100 simulated mutational samples for each tumor type, one mutation at a step, from the last-ordered mutation to the first. \n\nFor the last-ordered mutation we randomly assign 1 to reconstructed samples corresponding to the frequency of the mutation in the genuine datasets. To assign the occurrence of every other mutation   to the reconstructed samples, we train   to predict the occurrence of   from the sequence starting from the mutation ordered last up to time point   and apply   to the simulated sequence (synthesized up to time point  ), to obtain a vector of scores predicting the occurrence of mutation   in each reconstructed sample. We then use  , the frequency of the   ordered mutation in the genuine datasets, and assign 1 to the   mutations that were assigned with highest scores by   when applied to the reconstructed sequences. \n\nPCA was applied to the integration of all datasets (  and  ) or, when inferring the PCA coefficient, without the training sets ( ). \n\n\n### Training LSTMs to Identify Mutations That Interact with the Major Cancer Drivers and Assigning Major Drivers to Interacting Mutations. \n  \nWe select the driver genes in which mutations are observed frequently in our training sets (top 0.1 percentile). These genes are defined as major drivers and are used as an ordered sequence of mutations (  n   = 42 for colon and   n   = 26 for lung;  ). The sequence of occurrences of these major drivers is used to predict the occurrence of other mutations, excluding those with very low frequency (genes that are mutated in three samples or less) as the prediction of those could be obtained easily by chance. We hence trained 42 LSTMs for colon and 26 for lung (using the sequence of major drivers up to each time point). The genes that could be predicted with AUC > 0.85 for the test set repeatedly, from multiple locations in the sequence of drivers, are selected as predicted interactors of the major drivers. \n\nWe then use the scores produced by the LSTMs where the driver-interacting gene is well predicted and correlate them with the occurrence of each of the major drivers. The major drivers whose occurrence is significantly correlated (Spearman   P   value < 0.05) with the LSTM scores predicting a given driver-interacting gene are combined with it into driver\u2013interactor pairs. A detailed graphical schema describing the steps of this analysis can be found in  \n\n\n### Enrichment with STRING Interactions and GO Analysis. \n  \nTo investigate whether the pairs of major drivers and their predicted interactors are enriched with established interactions, we performed the following analyses: (  i  ) STRING enrichment, in which hypergeometric enrichment analysis was performed for each major driver gene, to find if its LSTM-predicted interactors are enriched with its interactors from the STRING database, and (  ii  ) GO enrichment, where for each major driver, we calculated the percentage of its associated interactors that share a significant number of GO processes with it (hypergeometric   P   value < 0.05) and the mean percentage of overlapping GO pathways with its interactors. We then calculate an empirical   P   value from 1,000 repetitions, with drivers randomly assigned to the identified interacting mutations (maintaining the same degree). \n\n\n### Modules of Major Drivers and Interacting Genes. \n  \nTo cover as many drivers as possible, we created modules via a heuristic search using 10,000 repetitions of the following genetic algorithm. Starting with a randomly selected major driver, in each round, we randomly selected a major driver that had not yet been added to the module and added it to the module if its addition did not decrease the number of mutual module-interactors by more than 20%. The round ended when 100 random selections were not added to the current module or when the number of interactors of a module was less than 3. Finally, we investigated the 10,000 modules and selected those that together cover maximal number of major drivers such that the modules were mutually exclusive with respect to both drivers and interactors. \n\n\n### Survival Analyses. \n  \nAll Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses are performed by comparing the survival of patients with high scores (module mutational count larger than median) to those with low scores, using a one-sided log-rank test. \n\n\n### Code Availability. \n  \nAll code was implemented in MATLAB_R2018a using Deep Learning Toolbox and is publicly available through GitHub:  . \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6510994, "text_md5": "ed77918c3f3c9493218f8bb3951ed6a7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 55], "journal": [56, 80], "publication_year": [82, 86], "title": [97, 165], "keywords": [179, 268], "abstract": [281, 2546], "body": [2555, 44021]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31015295, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1901695116", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6510994", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6510994"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6510994\">6510994</a>", "list_title": "PMC6510994  In silico learning of tumor evolution through mutational time series"}

Gene regulation occurs within transcriptional units through productive enhancer-promoter contacts and/or by inclusion within transcriptionally active membraneless structures, called phase-separated condensates . The transcriptional units are contained within megabase-sized self-interacting chromatin structures known as topologically associated domains (TADs). The boundaries of TADs are enriched for binding of structural proteins including CTCF and cohesin . Genome organization also exhibits A (active) and B (inactive) chromatin compartments, which display distinct patterns of DNA replication and transcription along with differences in regulatory marks . Across the 3D hierarchy, genome topology undergoes dynamic and contextual physical alterations in distinct tissues and cell types . These adaptations correlate with activation of specific   cis  -regulatory elements (CREs) that contribute to the establishment of unique gene expression patterns . Cell-type specific gene expression is further orchestrated by super-enhancers (SEs), regulatory regions spanning over tens of kilobases that are highly enriched for master transcription factor (TF) binding and co-localized with the active histone mark H3K27Ac . \n\nOver the past decade, millions of human genetic variations have been cataloged , permitting exploration of evolutionary divergence as well as healthy and disease phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common multifactorial retinal diseases afflicting adult human populations, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma, have predominantly identified common variants in non-coding regions of the genome . However, the biological relevance of association signals has been difficult to assess because of the local linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the region of lead variants, hindering identification of specific causal genes and variants . Even in Mendelian retinal diseases with over 200 associated genes identified (RetNet;  ), causal mutations can only be identified in about half of the patients (primarily in European population)  and genotype-phenotype correlations have been difficult to decipher. Non-coding variants in   cis  -regulatory regions may lead to variable penetrance of pathogenic coding mutations in their target genes , genetic epistasis , or account for missing heritability . Widespread variability in gene expression observed in humans can be assigned to   cis  - or   trans  -acting variants (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs) and epistasis . Elucidating how trait-associated genetic variations impact the regulatory landscape and consequently phenotypes requires understanding the 3D genome topology in relevant tissues and cell types. \n\nHere, we report a high-resolution chromatin contact map of the adult human retina by performing Hi-C . Further integration of chromatin contacts with histone marks, chromatin accessibility, selected TF binding, and gene expression datasets reveals targets of CREs and uncovers properties of 3D chromatin organization of SEs in human retina. Finally, we combine the resulting retinal genomic regulation network with eQTLs and genetic variants identified through GWAS of AMD and glaucoma. Thus, our analysis of regulatory 3D genome architecture contributes to better understanding of genetic control of human retinal phenotypes. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Deep Hi-C sequencing identifies chromatin structures in human retina at 5\u2009kb resolution \n  \nFigure\u00a0  illustrates the design of our study to elucidate regulatory networks controlling gene expression in the human retina and their potential disruption by genetic variants associated with clinical phenotypes. Briefly, we have generated a high-resolution chromatin contact map of the human retina using Hi-C and integrated this data with histone marks, chromatin accessibility, CTCF, and binding of selected TFs. We then explored the genome topology of eQTLs and variants associated with AMD and glaucoma (Fig.\u00a0 ).    High-resolution Hi-C identifies human retinal chromatin structures.  \n A   Schematic of project workflow. Input data on blue backgrounds were generated in this manuscript; input data on yellow backgrounds were downloaded from public databases. Hi-C contact maps of observed contacts across (  B  ) all chromosomes, (  C  ) the q arm of chromosome 14, and (  D  ) the   NRL   and   VSX2  /  ESRRB   loci. Scale represents the number of raw contacts. Loops at the   NRL   and   VSX2  /  ESRRB   loci are plotted on the top; contact maps are below with TADs plotted as black triangles.

Abbreviations: ROSE Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers, AMD Age-related macular degeneration, GWAS Genome-wide association study. \n  \n\nTo decipher the 3D organization of chromatin, we performed Hi-C analysis of four independent postmortem human retina samples. The Hi-C data exhibited high similarity among samples with a stratified correlation coefficient (SCC) of >0.97 for all autosomes. We therefore combined the data from all samples to obtain a total sequencing depth of 1.148 billion read pairs. A high proportion of valid interactions (>95% of the total mapped interactions) and typical percentage of trans-interactions (23.6%; Supplementary table\u00a0 ) indicated the high quality of our dataset. We obtained 704 million valid chromatin contacts (Supplementary table\u00a0 ), which are equally distributed among the chromosomes, attaining a resolution of 3\u2009kb (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). Our data identified 67,841 significant chromatin contacts and 2948 TADs (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nAs predicted, the genes expressed in the retina are detected in the A chromatin compartment, while most silent genes appear in the B compartment (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). For example,   NRL   is expressed in rods,   ESRRB   in rods and horizontal cells, and   VSX2   in bipolar and Muller glia cells; each of the three genes is present within a well-defined A compartment TAD and participates in extensive intra-TAD chromatin looping (Fig.\u00a0 ), which is likely required for qualitatively and quantitatively precise regulation . We then characterized the loops associated with expressed chromatin at the genome-wide level. Intra-A compartment loops are shorter compared to the intra-B (Tukey HSD:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; 95% CI 416\u2013449\u2009kb) and the A-B compartment loops (Tukey HSD:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; 95% CI 308\u2013398\u2009kb; Fig.\u00a0 ). These intra-A loops, corresponding to the active chromatin, span less than 1\u2009Mb on average (Fig.\u00a0 ) and are mostly constrained within TADs (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Human retina chromatin topology is tissue-specific and conserved in mouse \n  \nTo assess whether the identified chromatin features are specific to the retina, we compared our dataset with Hi-C datasets from human neurons (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons) , GM12878 lymphoblastoid immortalized cells (LCL) , and colon cancer cells (HCT116; generated in this study). The correlation, as measured by SCC, is the highest among our four retina samples (Fig.\u00a0 ). Retina compartments reveal high correlation with those of ACC neurons though limited to few chromosomes, likely because of the improper calling of compartments in the low-resolution ACC dataset (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). The compartments in the non-transformed LCL dataset are broadly similar with retinal compartments, whereas the cancer cells exhibit the lowest correlation (Fig.\u00a0 ).    Retinal chromatin interactions are tissue specific and conserved in mouse.  \n A   Stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC) showing similarity of contact maps between tissue types averaged across all autosomal chromosomes.

Abbreviations LCL Lymphoblastoid B-cell line, ACC Anterior cingulate cortex, TADs Topologically associating domains. \n  \n\nWe hypothesized that regions in the A compartment, which are detected in retina but not in other tissues, are related to retina-specific functions. Indeed, retina-specific genes such as   OTX2  ,   EYS  ,   PDC   are present in the A compartment only in the retina (Fig.\u00a0 ). Given the high correlation between retina and ACC neurons, we compared the contact maps of   PAX6  ,   OTX2   and   CRX   between the two datasets. As predicted, interactions at the   PAX6   locus are similar in neurons and retina concordant with its expression in both tissues (Fig.\u00a0 , left panel), whereas loci encoding   OTX2   and   CRX  , two key retinal TFs, demonstrate a high number of local interactions in the retina but not in neurons (Fig.\u00a0 , central and right panels). \n\nDistinct chromatin interactions at retinal genes suggest their important role in tissue-specific gene regulation. We then assessed whether these interactions are conserved between human and mouse retina. To quantify shared chromatin interactions, we evaluated the number of gene pairs present in the same TAD in our human and a previously reported mouse retina Hi-C datasets . We observed that 21.8% of mouse gene pairs in a mouse TAD are also localized in the corresponding human TAD (Fig.\u00a0  top panel), and that 35.7% of mouse gene pairs interacting through a chromatin loop in the retina are also interacting in human (Fig.\u00a0  bottom panel). These numbers likely represent an underestimate of shared chromatin structure due to the relatively lower resolution of the mouse retina Hi-C data. As an example, the   PITX2/EGF   locus, located in a human/mouse syntenic region, extends over 3 TADs in the human retina. This region encompasses several expressed genes, with   EGF   and   ENPEP   genes interacting together, each at a TAD boundary (Fig.\u00a0 ). Self-interacting domains corresponding to the human TADs (Fig.\u00a0 , dashed lines) are detectable in the mouse retina (Fig.\u00a0 ), even though not identified as TADs in the original study. Furthermore, in both species, chromatin loops are observed between   EGF   and   ENPEP   (Fig.\u00a0 ). These findings show that retina-expressed genes exhibit a conserved chromatin topology, underlining its importance for the regulation of retinal genes and likely involving tissue-specific CREs. \n\n\n### Retinal SEs overlap with highly expressed tissue-specific genes and are enriched for accessible retinal TF binding motifs \n  \nChromatin looping plays a crucial role in promoting physical interactions between CREs and their target genes to precisely control gene expression. To identify retinal CREs, we determined chromatin states using a Hidden Markov Model (ChromHMM)  based on chromatin accessibility (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ) and active (H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, H3K4me2 ) and repressive (H3K9me3) histone marks. We set the model for 10 chromatin states (see Methods, and Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ) and performed manual annotation. Of these states, we removed three with low signal and annotated one as promoters (high chromatin accessibility and enriched for all active marks), five as active or poised enhancers (high chromatin accessibility and enriched for all active marks except H3K4me3), and one as heterochromatin (enriched for H3K9me3) (Fig.\u00a0 ). Promoters and active or poised enhancers are enriched for binding of CTCF and key retinal TFs such as CRX, NRL, OTX2, MEF2D, CREB, and RORB (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, active and poised enhancers are enriched at regions upstream to TSS, whereas promoters are enriched at TSS only (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ).

The distribution of SEs along chromosomes is not homogenous and shows a very low correlation (R \u2009=\u20090.31) between the number of SEs per chromosome and the chromosome size (Fig.\u00a0  left panel and Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). Interestingly, however, we detected a high correlation (R \u2009=\u20090.86) between the number of retina-expressed genes and the number of SEs per chromosome (Fig.\u00a0 , right panel). Retinal SEs also form large chromatin domains spanning over 10 to 300\u2009kb (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nIntegration of SEs with transcriptome data revealed 2.17x higher average expression of genes overlapping with SEs compared to those with CREs and 2.89x higher than 100 sets of random SE-sized loci (henceforth called \u201crandom regions\u201d, see Methods for details) (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Notably, nearly 50% of retina-enriched genes and 70% of rod-enriched genes show an overlap with a SE compared to ~5% with random regions (Fig.\u00a0 ). The key photoreceptor-specific gene   NRL   is included within a large SE enriched for active histone marks and accessible chromatin regions (Fig.\u00a0 ). Accessible footprints within SEs are enriched for binding peaks of retinal TFs such as NRL, CRX, OTX1/2, CREB and RORB (Fig.\u00a0 ). Furthermore, hotspots of TF binding sites are present predominantly in SEs compared to CREs or random regions (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). We also confirmed that accessible chromatin regions in retinal SEs are enriched for binding of two key photoreceptor TFs, CRX and NRL, alone or in combination (Fig.\u00a0 , right panel). We discovered that CRX and NRL bound loci are enriched for binding motifs of other TFs involved in retinal gene regulation including OTX2, MEF2C, NEUROD1 and MAFG (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). In addition, we uncovered an enrichment of motifs for retina-expressed TFs, e.g., ZBTB18, for which a specific function has not been delineated in retinal cell types (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). The genes encoding many of these TFs with enriched binding motifs also overlap SEs, suggesting their potential role in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### SEs are enriched for intra-TAD looping and contacts with regulatory elements \n  \nSEs may contact other regulatory regions to form large transcriptional units capable of regulating multiple genes, as previously observed in cell lines . Integrated analysis revealed that retinal SEs are enriched for shorter chromatin loops compared to the random regions (  t  \u2009=\u200969.46;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ) and show extensive intra-SE looping (Fig.\u00a0 ). Distinctly, nearly all SE-interacting loops are <1\u2009Mb (Fig.\u00a0 ) indicating that SEs primarily harbor interactions within TADs. To validate this observation, we quantified the percentage of intra-TAD loops overlapping with SEs. We detected an enrichment of loops interacting within the same TAD compared to the random regions (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u221224.76;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), whereas we observed fewer than expected loops interacting across TADs (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u221218.81;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ).    SEs display a distinct chromatin looping pattern.  \n A   Size distribution of loops intersecting with at least one SE (  n  \u2009=\u200914,491 loops) or random SE-sized genomic region (  n  \u2009=\u2009299,795 total loops across 100 randomly generated regions, see methods). Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers mark 1.5x the IQR; data beyond 1.5x the IQR are plotted as individual points.   B   Distribution of loops per SE or random SE-sized genomic region either making contact with at least one foot touching an SE/random region (left) or both feet contained within a single SE/random region (right).   C   Percentage of loops in contact with SEs (  n  \u2009=\u20091) or random regions (  n  \u2009=\u2009100) that cross TAD boundaries. Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers mark 1.5x the IQR; data beyond 1.5x the IQR are plotted as individual points.   D   Number of unique pairs of features connected by chromatin looping (  n  \u2009=\u20091 SEs dataset,   n  \u2009=\u2009100 random regions datasets). Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers mark 1.5x the IQR; data beyond 1.5x the IQR are plotted as individual points.

Abbreviations SE Super-enhancer, TAD Topologically associating domain, CRE Cis-regulatory element, TSS Transcription start site. \n  \n\nTo quantify the significance of chromatin looping at SEs, we defined SE interactions as those with another regulatory element or with a target gene. We discovered that SEs are enriched for regulatory interactions compared to random regions, making direct contact with 3,059 unique CREs (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u2212361;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), 1,701 unique TSS (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u2212346;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), and 217 unique SEs (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u2212651;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ). Remarkably, the genes specifically expressed in the retina and/or brain are mostly overlapping with SEs, whereas the genes interacting but not overlapping with SEs are enriched for ubiquitous genes (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). Some SEs interact with many CREs and thereby likely play important roles in coordinating gene expression patterns. For example, the SE overlapping with   MIR9-2  , a non-coding gene crucial for neuronal development  localizes at a TAD boundary and contacts several CREs (Fig.\u00a0 ). We also identified several clusters of SEs interacting with one another via chromatin looping near retina-enriched genes, including   VEGFA   (Fig.\u00a0 ) and   UBE4B   (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Intra-TAD positioning of SEs is associated with boundary insulation and biological function of target genes \n  \nTo explore the chromatin landscape around SEs, we assessed physical properties of the corresponding host TADs. We first compared the TAD size in relation to the position of SE within the TAD. We observed that, within the A compartment, TADs containing SEs are larger than TADs without SEs, except when the SE is located at one of the TAD edges (Fig.\u00a0 , left panel). We then calculated the insulation score, which, for each genomic locus, quantifies the interaction frequency between neighboring loci; a lower score indicates stronger insulation. Our analysis showed that the presence of SEs at the edge of TADs is associated with weaker insulation, i.e., increased contact between neighboring TADs (Fig.\u00a0 , right panel). We then evaluated whether SE positioning within TADs was associated with the number of inter-TAD contacts. We identified more chromatin interactions within SE-containing TADs compared to other TADs, despite no significant difference in loop size among A-compartment TADs (Fig.\u00a0 ). In concordance with the observed weaker insulation, TADs with a SE at one edge have a significantly higher proportion of loops crossing the TAD boundary compared to other TADs (Fig.\u00a0 ).    SEs intra-TAD positioning is linked to TADs biological features.  \nCharacterizing TADs fully contained within B compartment or A compartment; A compartment TADs are further divided based upon SE presence/absence and SE position (edge SEs are SEs <5\u2009kb from TAD boundary) (  n  \u2009=\u2009680 TADs in B compartment,   n  \u2009=\u2009670 TADs without SE in A compartment,   n  \u2009=\u2009495 TADs with non-edge SE in A compartment,   n  \u2009=\u2009183 TADs with edge SE in A compartment). These groups vary in [  A  ] mean TAD size (two-sided, one-way ANOVA,   F  \u2009=\u2009270.8,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and TAD boundary insulation (two-sided, one-way ANOVA,   F  \u2009=\u200991.01,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; lower log  insulation score corresponds to stronger insulation) as well as in [  B  ] the number of chromatin loops in contact with the TAD (two-sided, one-way ANOVA   F  \u2009=\u200919.85,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), mean size of those loops (two-sided, one-way ANOVA   F  \u2009=\u200975.47,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), and percentage of loops which cross TAD boundaries (two-sided, one-way ANOVA   F  \u2009=\u200918.66,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). * indicates   p  \u2009<\u20090.05; **   p  \u2009<\u20090.01; ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 by ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc test. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.   C   Enriched Reactome terms among genes with a TSS residing within or in contact via chromatin looping with a non-edge or edge SE.   D   Chromatin loops, SEs, CREs, log  insulation score, TADs, and Hi-C contact maps for the   FOS   locus.   Abbreviations   SE: Super-enhancer, TAD: Topologically associating domain; CRE: Cis-regulatory element; TSS: Transcription start site. \n  \n\nNext, we looked at the function of the SE target genes, i.e., genes with TSS overlapping or interacting with SE. We observed that TADs with edge SEs are enriched for stress response genes indicating the need for more dynamic and transitional interactions (Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas retinal genes are primarily enriched in TADs with central SEs (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). The SE overlapping the stress-response gene   FOS   is an example of an edge SE within a low insulation TAD that may be affected by variation in regions extending beyond their own TAD boundaries (Fig.\u00a0 ). Similarly, at the   ATF4   locus, a SE lying at the edge of a lowly insulated TAD is in contact with regions outside of the TAD (Supplementary fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Integration of chromatin loops, SEs and CREs with retinal eQTLs \n  \neQTLs link specific genetic variants to changes in expression of a target gene (henceforth called \u201ceGene\u201d). To identify eQTLs that are potentially relevant for retinal gene regulation, we incorporated 14,859 previously reported retina eQTLs  with our dataset and observed that 77% of these localize to the A compartment compared to 18.5% in the B compartment (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Interestingly, the A compartment includes 82.9% of eQTLs linked to retinopathy genes (RetNet,  ), 90% of those associated with AMD loci , and 53.5% eQTLs correlated to glaucoma loci  (Fig.\u00a0 ). eQTLs are enriched for variant-eGene pairs sharing the same TAD (67.1% of all eQTLs, 75.4% of those in retinopathies, 73.3% AMD-associated eQTLs, and 79.2% glaucoma eQTLs) compared to randomly generated TADs (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Thus, most retinal eQTLs are present within the active chromatin compartment and reside in the same TAD, providing a direct mechanism to explain the impact of a variant on the eGene.    Epigenetic context of retinal eQTLs and eQTLs associated with eye disease.  \nProportion of unique eQTLs (variant / eGene pairs) and unique eQTLs involving genes associated with eye disease (  A  ) overlapping each chromatin compartment or (  B  ) share the same observed (  n  \u2009=\u20091) or random TAD (  n  \u2009=\u2009100; see methods). Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers mark 1.5x the IQR; data beyond 1.5x the IQR are plotted as individual points.; *** indicates   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 by two-sided t-test between observed and random TADs.   C   Schematic of eQTL annotation depending on the variant position relative to TSS.   D   Number of unique eQTLs and unique eQTLs involving genes associated with eye disease overlapping with a loop that are not in contact with any TSS (eQTL only), in contact with any TSS excluding the eGene TSS (non-eGene pieQTL), or in contact with the TSS of their eGene (eGene pieQTL).

F   Total H3K27Ac coverage around variants (\u00b1100\u2009bp) of each unique eQTLs (variants / eGene pairs) and unique eQTLs involving genes associated eye disease, overlapping a CRE or SE (  n  \u2009=\u20091677 eQTLs overlapping a distal CRE,   n  \u2009=\u2009744 eQTLs overlapping a promoter CRE,   n  \u2009=\u200912 glaucoma eQTLs overlapping a distal CRE,   n  \u2009=\u20095 glaucoma eQTLs overlapping a promoter CRE,   n  \u2009=\u200944 retinal disease eQTLs overlapping a distal CRE,   n  \u2009=\u200916 retinal disease eQTLs overlapping a promoter CRE,   n  \u2009=\u20092 AMD eQTLs overlapping a distal CRE;   n  \u2009=\u2009763 eQTLs overlapping a distal SE,   n  \u2009=\u2009121 eQTLs overlapping a promoter SE,   n  \u2009=\u20093 glaucoma eQTLs overlapping a distal SE,   n  \u2009=\u20092 glaucoma eQTLs overlapping a promoter SE,   n  \u2009=\u200934 retinal disease eQTLs overlapping a distal SE,   n  \u2009=\u20098 retinal disease eQTLs overlapping a promoter SE,   n  \u2009=\u20092 AMD eQTLs overlapping a distal SE). Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers mark 1.5x the IQR; data beyond 1.5x the IQR are plotted as individual points.   G   Examples of promoters and pieQTLs associated to retinopathies (  PRPH2   locus  )  , glaucoma (  MYO7A   locus, top panels), AMD (  ABCA1   locus, bottom left panel) and at   PCK2   locus (bottom right panel). Tracks represent the chromatin loops, eQTLs variants, SEs, CREs, H3K27Ac coverage, TADs and genes. \n  \n\nWe then assessed the physical proximity between a variant and the promoter region (\u00b12.5\u2009kb from TSS) of its eGene, as described . This analysis allowed us to discriminate between promoter eQTLs, distal eQTLs, and distal eQTLs interacting with a promoter (pieQTLs, see methods) (Fig.\u00a0 ). We identified 2,374 eQTLs overlapping with a loop foot; of these, 1,275 are pieQTLs and 100 interact with their own eGene promoter (Fig.\u00a0 ). Among these pieQTLs, 27 are associated with retinopathies, including 3 that interact with their own eGene promoter (  MYO7A  ,   MERTK   and   PRPH2   genes). Finally, 4 pieQTLs are each associated with AMD and glaucoma loci (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). \n\nAdditional analysis identified 2,410 and 880 eQTLs in CREs (CRE-eQTLs) and SEs (SE-eQTLs), respectively, with 58.5% of CRE-eQTLs and 69.3% of SE-eQTLs also intersecting the associated eGene (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). A majority of retinopathy-associated CRE-eQTLs (39/60) and SE-eQTLs (38/42) overlaps the respective eGene (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Furthermore, we discovered 3 CRE-eQTLs and 2 SE-eQTLs in AMD-associated loci and 17 CRE-eQTLs and 5 SE-eQTLs in glaucoma-associated loci (Fig.\u00a0 ). In accordance with their potential role in gene regulation, all CRE- and SE-overlapping eQTLs exhibit prominent H3K27Ac marks, with promoter eQTLs showing even higher levels compared to distal eQTLs, though not statistically significant for the disease-associated eQTLs, due to the lower number of eQTLs (all eQTLs at CREs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u221214.266,   p  \u2009<\u20092.2e-16, retinopathies-associated eQTLs at CREs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22123.6947,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001861, glaucoma-associated eQTLs at CREs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.2145,   p  \u2009=\u20090.09055, all eQTLs at SEs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22128.3212,   p  \u2009=\u20099.098e-14, retinopathies-associated eQTLs at SEs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.8884,   p  \u2009=\u20090.02003, glaucoma-associated eQTLs at SEs:   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.2834,   p  \u2009=\u20090.4206, Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nOverall, most eQTLs are physically close to their respective eGene, either overlapping the eGene or its promoter, or being in contact through chromatin looping. Our analysis identified multiple potentially functionally-relevant eQTLs overlapping a SE and in physical contact with the promoter of their eGene (e.g.,   PRPH2   and   MYO7A   loci; Fig.\u00a0 , top panels) or through chromatin looping (  PRPH2   locus; Fig.\u00a0 , top left panel). We also identified eQTLs overlapping a CRE, either at the promoter of the eGene (e.g.,   ABCA1   locus; Fig.\u00a0 , bottom left panel) or by contacting the promoter through chromatin looping (e.g.,   PCK2   locus; Fig.\u00a0 , bottom right panel). \n\n\n### Genome topology links target genes to AMD- and Glaucoma-associated risk variants \n  \nWe then leveraged our dataset to investigate chromatin contacts of 52 and 127 lead GWAS variants identified for AMD and glaucoma, respectively . We also identified and filtered variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the lead variants (filtered LD variants, see methods)  and integrated these with retinal chromatin loops and regulatory elements. \n\nAmong AMD variants, 4 lead and 142 filtered LD variants overlap with chromatin loops (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Of these, 3 lead variants (C  20orf85  ,   CTRB2/CTRB1   and   KMT2E/SRPK2   loci) and 136 filtered LD variants distributed among 10 loci [  COL8A1  ,   PILRB/PILRA  ,   TGFBR1  ,   ARHGAP21  ,   RDH5/CD63  ,   ACAD10  ,   RAD51B  ,   C3   (  NRTN/FUT6  ),   APOE   (  EXOC3L2/MARK4  ) and   SLC16A8   loci] are in contact with gene bodies or TSS through chromatin loops (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). In contrast, no overlap is detected between chromatin loops in ACC neurons and AMD lead variants even\u00a0though 162 of the 196 filtered LD variants overlapping a loop in ACC are in contact with a gene body or TSS. Notably, at the   KMT2E/SRPK2   locus, the AMD-associated lead variant rs1142 is in contact with the TSS of   KMT2E   and   SRPK2   and with the gene body of 7 genes, which include   KMT2E  ,   SRPK2  ,   EFCAB10  ,   LINC01004  ,   PUS7  ,   AC007384.1   and   AC005070.3   through 9 chromatin loops (Fig.\u00a0 , top panel). The lead variant rs72802342, associated with the   CTRB2/CTRB1   locus, connects with the gene bodies and TSS of   CFDP1   and   AC009054.2   through 6 chromatin loops (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom panel). We also identified 5 AMD lead variants overlapping with a CRE and localizing to gene bodies (  ARHGAP21  ,   ARMS2/HTRA1  ,   CNN2  ,   APOE   and   TNFRSF10A   genes) and one AMD lead variant (rs3750846) overlapping with a SE and gene bodies of   ARMS2   and   BX842242.1   (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ).    AMD and glaucoma variants are connected to target genes via retinal chromatin loops.  \n A   Count of AMD lead variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD variants; MAF\u2009\u2265\u20091% & R  score \u2265 0.7, shown in parenthesis) contacting genes via chromatin loops in retina or ACC neurons, or residing in retina CREs or SEs.

D   Chromatin loops, lead variants, LD variants, CTCF binding, SEs, CREs, TADs, and Hi-C contact maps for two glaucoma GWAS loci. Abbreviations AMD Age-related macular degeneration, GWAS Genome-wide association study, LD Linkage disequilibrium, TSS Transcription start site, MAF Minor allele frequency, CTCF CCCTC-binding factor, SE Super-enhancer, TAD Topologically associating domain, CRE Cis-regulatory element. \n  \n\nAmong glaucoma variants, 12 lead variants and 493 filtered LD variants overlap a chromatin loop (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Of these, 8 lead variants (  TRAPPC3, LPP, TFAP2B/PKHD1, PDE7B, FBXO32, ADAMTS8, RIC8B   and   LINC00396/COL4A1   loci) and 363 filtered LD variants are in contact with gene bodies or TSS (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). In ACC neurons, 10 lead variants and 2,118 filtered LD variants overlap loops; of these, 9 lead variants and 1,890 filtered LD variants are in contact with a gene body or a TSS. For example, the lead variant rs72904286, associated with   TFAP2B/PKHD1   locus is in contact with the gene body and TSS of   TFAP2B   through a chromatin loop (Fig.\u00a0 , top panel). The lead variant rs1037013, associated with   RIC8B   locus is in contact with the gene body of 4 target genes which include   RIC8B, RFX4, POLR3B  , and   AC079385.1   and with the TSS of   RFX4   through chromatin looping (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom panel). We also detected 16 glaucoma lead variants overlapping a CRE with 14 of these localizing to gene bodies or TSS, and 5 glaucoma lead variants overlapping a SE and a gene body or TSS (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSpatial architecture of chromatin is highly dynamic and requires active control mechanisms . The adult retina is comprised of non-dividing and highly-specialized sensory neurons and thus offers a relatively stable environment for investigating the role of 3D genome in controlling genetic information. Hi-C allows the exploration of 3D genome architecture by identifying chromatin contacts but can only reveal pairwise interactions. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether several regions interacting together in a Hi-C contact map coexist in each cell of the population, or whether these reflect a heterogeneous cell population each with unique pairs of interacting regions. At higher resolution, fine regulatory structures can resolve such promoter-enhancer interactions. Our data have a resolution of almost 3\u2009kb, which means that significant chromatin contacts spanning over just few kilobases can be identified. We noted a non-homogeneous average resolution across the genome, with some regions requiring additional sequencing to reach this resolution whereas others exceeding this at our sequencing depth. This heterogeneity was considered when statistically calling significant contacts at each genomic location. \n\nOur deep sequencing of chromatin contacts integrated with chromatin accessibility and histone marks in human retina has provided detailed information on contacts of distal regulatory elements, including SEs, with their cognate promoter regions. Integrating this regulatory 3D map with CTCF and retinal TF binding and CREs  has allowed us to construct a comprehensive gene regulatory network. We show that retina SEs frequently overlap with retina-enriched genes coding for key retinal TFs including NRL, CRX, OTX2, RORB and MEF2D, whereas TFs they encode bind extensively to SEs. This interconnected, self-regulating TF network may represent a core transcriptional regulatory circuit for maintaining cell identity as observed in embryonic stem cells (  sensu  ). We have taken advantage of this regulatory architecture to delineate tissue-specific genomic regulation and identify the link between eQTL variants and eGenes via regulatory elements and/or chromatin looping. Finally, by combining our findings with AMD and Glaucoma GWAS, we have uncovered candidate causal genes contributing to these complex traits. \n\nMost SEs we identified are associated with rod genes reflecting rod cell-dominance in human retinal samples. However, we also captured signals from divergent low abundance retinal cell types. For example, relative to random regions, we observe elevated SE overlap with bipolar, cone photoreceptor, and M\u00fcller glia genes as well as increased chromatin looping between SEs and horizontal cell genes. Additionally, we noted several retinal pigment epithelial cell markers with TSS overlapping A Compartment and enriched for active regulatory marks (e.g.,   BEST-1  ,   MERTK  ,   RLBP1  ,   MITF  ,   PMEL  ). A previous study of human retina identified accessible chromatin and TF binding peaks assessed by ChIP-seq at regulatory elements of both rod and non-rod genes . In contrast, mostly rod-associated gene states were identified in mouse retina via ChromHMM analysis , and no robust chromatin interactions detected between non-rod enhancers/promoters and SE via Hi-C . As predicted, many chromatin interactions correlate with tissue-specific expression and are conserved in mouse. \n\nWe demonstrate that the biological function of SE target genes can be associated with SE localization in TADs as well as TAD boundary insulation. Notably, SEs themselves show interaction mostly with loci in close proximity, suggesting strong insulation at the local, sub-TAD level likely due to the enrichment for CTCF binding and to avoid random activation of nearby genes, consistent with previous studies . Unexpectedly, we detect weaker insulation at SE-containing TAD boundaries, in contrast to a previous study showing the association of SEs with increased TAD insulation . We believe this could be due to differing approaches to insulation score calculation. We measure boundary insulation based on contacts crossing a TAD boundary region, as recommended by the 4D Nucleome consortium (i.e., cooltools diamond insulation). In contrast, other study normalized this count using the contacts in adjacent regions , leading to a bias of insulation score for adjacent regions rich in local loops (such as the SE-containing regions). We should point out that TAD boundary localization varies at the single cell level , therefore the insulation score at boundaries can also reflect the heterogeneity in the tissue. Thus, we propose that chromatin architecture could be more dynamic around these transcription hotspots. For example, a SE and its associated genes could be dynamically targeted to, and released from subnuclear compartments, temporally disrupting the TAD boundary in a subset of cells. This would be reflected at the population level by a lower insulation at the affected TAD boundary. In concordance with this hypothesis, SE at the edge of a TAD could affect the boundary to a greater extent compared to SE in the middle of a TAD, leading to a weaker insulation at edge-SE TAD boundaries, as we observe here. \n\nOur integrated analysis has uncovered multi-way SE-chromatin interactions centered around hub-like genomic regions, as observed in other tissues . For example, the SE overlapping   FOS   connects large transcriptional units across multiple TADs and may facilitate rapid stress response. These hubs often connect genomic regions across long distances (>250\u2009kb); e.g., contacts between the CREs of   MEF2C  ,   VEGFA   and   CLSTN1   with distant genes. Notably, at the   MIR9-2   locus,   MEF2C   interacts with the gene   CETN3   which is associated with retinitis pigmentosa and located over 1\u2009Mb away. This suggests that genetic variations could impact retinal homeostasis and disease by targeting genes over very large distance. \n\nLong-range regulation is facilitated by the physical interaction between regulatory regions and their target genes, providing a probable mechanism for eQTLs to influence expression of eGenes located far from their variants. By integrating retina eQTLs  with chromatin looping, SEs, and CREs, we uncovered multiple variants lying in regulatory regions interacting with their target eGene including several pieQTLs, i.e., variants directly contacting the promoter of their eGene. Remarkably, we have identified multiple pieQTLs involving genes associated with retinal neurodegeneration illustrating the value of unbiased genetic association studies to identify genes linked to retinal diseases. Examining the chromatin state at these eQTLs can help prioritize specific variants for further investigation. For example, the variant associated with   PCK2   is lying in a large CRE enriched for active histone marks. Despite being almost 100\u2009kb away from   PCK2  , it is in direct contact with its promoter through a chromatin loop. Thus, different alleles at this locus could impact   PCK2   regulation affecting CRE efficiency, TF binding, and/or chromatin loop formation or stability. \n\nRetinal CREs and eQTLs having high resolution chromatin contacts should permit systematic analysis of relevant non-coding regulating regions for missing heritability and help in\u00a0addressing\u00a0issues of variable penetrance in inherited retinal diseases . Rare coding variants in over 200 genes associated with photoreceptor and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function can lead to vision impairment (RetNet;  ); yet, only in few instances, non-coding or structural alterations have been associated with human retinal disease . Variants in regulatory elements have been implicated in altering the effect of coding mutations on phenotypes . We propose that the analysis of functionally-relevant non-coding regions in rhodopsin,   ABCA4   and other known retinopathy genes, as identified in this study, would greatly augment our understanding of Mendelian retinal diseases. \n\nAdult-onset multifactorial diseases affecting retinal function are the major cause of irreversible vision impairment in humans. GWAS of Glaucoma and AMD have identified a large number of non-coding variants, and additional studies including eQTL analysis have provided further insights; yet, the causal genes and variants continue to be elusive for many associated loci. Our integrated analysis of adult human retinal genome topology with GWAS lead and LD variants has uncovered several previously unidentified genes potentially contributing to glaucoma and AMD. For example, we show a remarkable long-range interaction leading to identification of the target gene   TFAP2B   for glaucoma-associated variant rs72904286 at the   TFAP2B/PKHD1   locus. Disruption of   TFAP2B   expression in mouse results in a strong pathologic phenotype consistent with glaucoma . Interestingly, this phenotype is believed to be due to defects in the eye tissues originating from the neural crest , while we identified   TFAP2B   through data from the retina, originating from the neuroepithelium. It is possible that this apparent discrepancy is due to a lack of tissue specificity of the regulatory region containing the variant rs72904286, which could form non-tissue specific contacts with   TFAP2B  . Indeed, we demonstrate a similar number of chromatin interactions among glaucoma associated eQTLs and risk variants in both retina and in neurons, demonstrating weak tissue specificity for this eye disease. In contrast, AMD-associated eQTLs and risk variants reveal a strong enrichment for chromatin looping in the retina compared to neurons, demonstrating the value of examining genomic architecture of disease variants in the affected tissue. \n\nOur study has also led to identification of candidate causal genes for AMD. For example, we establish   CFDP1   as a candidate gene involved in AMD at the   CTRB2  /  CTRB1   locus. While the lead variant found at this locus (rs72802342) was previously associated to the target gene   BCAR1  , we show association of filtered variants in LD with rs72802342 to the gene coding for   CFDP1  . Indeed, the LD region at this lead variant is overlapping a retinal SE (chr16:75233500-75267000), which interacts with   CFDP1   through chromatin looping. We suggest that this variant could alter the expression of   CFDP1   by disrupting the SE structure and the interactions it facilitates. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the presence of a variant (rs11641532) in this LD region previously linked to the expression of   CFDP1   in TWAS analysis . Conservation of this genomic region from zebrafish to mammals  further underscores the importance of regulatory elements contained within. Notably, zebrafish mutants of   Cfdp1   exhibit a loss of Neurod1 positive cells in the retina . Altogether, this places regulation of   CFDP1   expression in the retina as a strong candidate for AMD risk. This example demonstrates how the integration of regulatory elements to 3D chromatin interactions can help clarify the biological impact of variants associated with retinal, and more broadly, human diseases. Notably, one limitation of the Hi-C approach is that the physical interaction between candidate enhancers and promoters does not directly demonstrate a functional relationship with respect to gene regulation. Additional studies are necessary to validate the significance of chromatin interaction on retina-specific gene expression. \n\nIn summary, we have generated a significant resource for the human retina, by integrating high resolution Hi-C data with epigenetic profiles and CREs, thereby facilitating investigations of genomic regulation, identification of missing heritability in retinopathies, and candidate causal genes and variants for common blinding diseases including AMD and glaucoma. Our studies thus provide a framework for connecting regulatory variants with retinal disease phenotypes and may assist in design of targeted translational paradigms by modulating genomic regulation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Retina tissues \n  \nFive postmortem human donor eyes (from 2 females and 3 males of 65\u201377 years age at the time of death) were procured from The National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA) (protocol DSWAS 001). Autopsy material from unidentified deceased persons is excluded from review by Institutional Review Board and does not require an Office of Human Subjects Research Protections (OHSRP) determination per 45 CFR 46 and NIH policy (OHSRP ID#: 18-NEI-00619). Eyes were enucleated within 14\u2009h of death and stored in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) supplemented with antibiotics at 4\u2009\u00b0C until dissection. Retinas were dissected and divided into four regions (dorsal, ventral, nasal and temporal) for further processing. Dorsal regions were used in further experiments. \n\n\n### Hi-C experiment \n  \nFreshly dissected human retina tissue (from 3 male and 1 female of 75\u201377 years age at the time of death) was crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10\u2009min, quenched with 125\u2009mM glycine for 5\u2009min and frozen until use for Hi-C experiments. Before processing for Hi-C, samples were crosslinked again in 2% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min, then quenched with 125\u2009mM glycine 5\u2009min at room temperature. Hi-C was performed on isolated nuclei using Arima-Hi-C kit (Arima Genomics, CA, USA) and Hyper Prep DNA-seq library prep kit (KK8502; Kapa Biosciences, MA, USA), following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. For HCT116 cell line (ATCC, VA, USA), 7\u2009\u00d7\u200910  cells were crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min, quenched for 5\u2009min with stop solution I, lysed, and processed for Hi-C using ARIMA-Hi-C kit. All libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, CA, USA) at a read length of 101 to 126 base pairs with a depth of approximately 300 million read pairs per sample for retina and 50 million read pairs for HCT116. \n\n\n### Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) \n  \nPeripheral retina sample (from 1 female of 75 years age at the time of death) was dissociated using papain as previously described , cryopreserved in HBSS solution containing 10% DMSO and slowly frozen using a Mr. Frosty container (Invitrogen, CA, USA). CUT&RUN was performed as previously described  using 200,000\u2013300,000 cells per experiment. Briefly, cells were bound to activated concavalin A beads for 7\u2009min at room temperature. Antibodies against H3K9me3 (Rabbit, cat.no. ab8898, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), H3K4me3 (Rabbit, cat.no. ab8580, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and control IgG (Rabbit, cat.no. 011-000-002, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA, USA) were used at a concentration of 1:100 in 100\u2009\u00b5l overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. pA-MNase conjugated to protein A (generous gift of Dr. Steven Henikoff, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, WA, USA) was used at a concentration of 700\u2009ng/ml for 1\u2009hr at 4\u2009 C and activated with calcium chloride for 30\u2009mins at 0\u2009\u00b0C. Released DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Libraries were prepared with SMARTer\u00ae ThruPLEX\u00ae DNA-Seq Kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc, CA, USA) and amplified with 15 PCR cycles (60\u2009\u00b0C extension). Pair-end sequencing was performed with read length of 50 base pairs using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, CA, USA). \n\n\n### Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) \n  \nATAC-seq was performed using fresh dissociated cells from five retinas (2 females and 3 males of 65\u201377 years age at the time of death). Tagmentation and library preparation were carried out as described  using Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (FC-121-1030, Illumina, San Diego, CA). Dissociated cells were quantified using a hemocytometer, and the nuclear fraction of 50,000 cells was incubated with tagmentation reaction mix (5\u2009\u00b5l Tn5, 25\u2009\u00b5l 2x tagmentation buffer, 20\u2009\u00b5l nuclease-free water) in a thermomix with 600\u2009rpm agitation. The DNA was purified by \u201cMinElute PCR Purification\u201d kit (Qiagen, 28004) followed by a two-sided size selection using a 0.5 and 1.5 ratio of SPRIselect reagent (Beckman Coulter B233181). All of the DNA was used to prepare the libraries, which were sequenced pair-end using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, CA, USA) at a read length of 50 base pairs. \n\n\n### Hi-C data processing \n  \nHi-C analysis was performed with HiCUP v0.8.0  using Arima-specific in silico digested hg38 genome for the retina and HCT116 samples, and MboI in silico digested hg38 genome for the published neuron and GM12878 samples . Filtered bam files produced by HiCUP v0.8.0  were converted to.hic files  and to HOMER  tag directories. Retina Hi-C resolution was estimated at 3.06\u2009kb using HiCRes . Reproducibility between samples as well as correlation with Hi-C from other tissues were assessed using HiCRep v1.0.0 : by computing the average SCC for chromosomes 1 to 22. Compartments were called with Homer v4.1  using 100\u2009kb sliding windows with a step of 50\u2009kb (using options superRes and res, respectively). Compartment correlation between different tissues was computed using R. Loops were called using FitHiC v2.0.7  on the merged Hi-C datasets, using 5\u2009kb resolution and an FDR threshold of 0.01. TADs calling was performed on the merged samples with domaincaller , using raw contact maps of 10\u2009kb bins. Insulation scores were computed using the diamond insulation tool from cooltools v0.4.0, using 100\u2009kb windows with 5\u2009kb bins. \n\n\n### ATAC-seq data processing \n  \nATAC-seq from five human retinas was analyzed by trimming the reads for Nextera transposase sequence and reducing their size to maximum 25\u2009bp using cutadapt v3.0  and FASTX toolkit (FASTX-Toolkit v0.0.14,   RRID  :  SCR_005534  ). Trimmed reads were mapped on hg38 using bowtie2 v2.3.5.1  and filtered for quality, duplicates and blacklisted regions (ENCODE dataset  ) using samtools v1.9 . Two sets of aligned read pairs were produced: TN5-shifted and non-shifted, to use with general tools (TN5-shifted) or specialized tools already including a TN5 shifting step (non-shifted). Quality controls were performed on the aligned read pairs by computing the normalized enrichment at TSS using HOMER , and by computing the fragment size. Retina 1 was chosen as the best dataset from this QC and used as input for ChromHMM  annotation v1.19 (see Chromatin annotation section). \n\n\n### Cut&Run processing \n  \nCut&Run datasets from one retina were processed by trimming the adaptors using cutadapt v3.0  and mapping locally with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1 , allowing dovetail on a chimeric genome (Human hg38,   S. cerevisiae   S288C;   E. coli   ASM584v2). No internal normalization was performed in these datasets since the proportion of read mapping on the yeast or on the bacterial genome was too low. Reads mapping on the human genome were then extracted, filtered for quality, duplicates, and blacklisted regions (ENCODE dataset  ) using samtools v1.9 . Quality of the experiment was visualized on IGV v2.11.9  after conversion to bigwig using deepTools  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### ChIP-seq data processing \n  \nPublic ChIP-seq datasets from human retina ( ) were reanalyzed using the same parameters as for Cut&Run, i.e., locally mapping the reads and allowing dovetail. Mapped reads were filtered for quality, duplicates, and blacklisted regions (ENCODE dataset  ) using samtools v1.9 . To select only one dataset per chromatin mark, autocorrelation was assessed using HOMER  and datasets with the highest same and different strand enrichments and the ratio same / different strand fold enrichment closer to one were selected for further analysis. Global quality was visually assessed using IGV v2.11.9  on mapped reads converted to bigwig using deepTools v3.3.0  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Chromatin binding peaks of CREB, CRX, CTCF, MEF2D, NRL, Otx1/2 and RORB were identified using MACS2 v2.2.7.1 . \n\n\n### Tissue- and cell type-enriched genes \n  \nTissue-enriched genes and cell type-enriched gene lists used in Figs.\u00a0 C,   and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas . \n\n\n### Chromatin annotation \n  \nThe chromatin annotation used for this project is an integration of public (H3K4me2, H3K27Ac) and lab-produced (H3K4me3, H3k9me3) chromatin histone marks with our best chromatin accessibility dataset (see ATAC-seq processing section). This integration was performed by transforming the read coverage to 500\u2009bp signal and computing chromatin states using the ChromHMM  tool v1.19. Models defining between 5 and 20 chromatin states were tested. For each model, we calculated the mean correlation between each chromatin state and the most similar chromatin state in each model with additional states. After 10 chromatin states, this correlation plateaued indicating that additional chromatin states provide minimal information. For each state of the 10-states model, the average coverage for the chromatin marks and accessibility were computed using HOMER  and the chromatin signatures for each segment were used to manually infer a biological annotation of each state. The average distributions of each state around the expressed and non-expressed genes were computed as a quality control using HOMER , with our previously published list of expressed genes in human retina  and all the other genes from HOMER TSS list as non-expressed genes. \n\n\n### CREs elements and SEs identification \n  \nChromatin states enriched for active histone marks identified by ChromHMM v1.19 were merged to generate a set of regions called here CREs. This list of CREs was integrated with the H3K27Ac ChIP-seq coverage and the corresponding input coverage to identify SE using the ROSE algorithm . \n\n\n### SE characterization \n  \nBasic SE characteristics were computed using R. Correlation between SE count and chromosome size or number of retina-expressed genes is measured as Pearson\u2019s r  computed with ggpubr v0.4.0. To identify statistically significant enrichment in SE characteristics, 100 random region datasets have been generated using bedtools random v2.29.2  with a length corresponding to the median length of SE and the number of regions per dataset equal to the number of SE. SEs and random regions have been overlapped with the Hi-C loops using bedtools PairToBed v2.29.2 . Statistics of the overlaps were computed using R. SEs and random regions were overlapped with all expressed genes as well as tissue- and cell type-enriched genes from the Human Protein Atlas  using bedtools intersect v2.29.2 . Genomic regions in contact with a SE or random region through chromatin were also overlapped with tissue- and cell type-enriched genes, CREs, and heterochromatin regions (from chromHMM  annotated states) using bedtools intersect v2.29.2 . \n\n\n### Accessible motifs analysis \n  \nTo identify accessible motifs, accessible chromatin loci were identified using MACS2 v2.2.7.1  on each dataset and the average coverage at ATAC peaks has been computed as a quality control using HOMER . Footprints have been extracted from each list of accessible loci using rgt-HINT v0.13.1 . Accessible footprint loci less than 20\u2009bp apart have been merged for all ATAC-seq experiments. Loci found in at least 3 retinas have been kept for motif finding. To control the quality of accessible footprint discovery, we identified binding motifs present within these footprints at an FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 using FIMO  with the motif database HOCOMOCOv11 . Then, the read coverage from CRX, NRL, CTCF and Input ChIP-seq around each CRX, NRL or CTCF accessible motifs were computed using HOMER and plotted using R. \n\nEnriched TF binding motifs from Fig.\u00a0  were computed by running AME from MEME suite v5.4.1 on accessible footprints within SE and containing CRX and NRL binding sites. SE-overlapping footprints without NRL or CRX binding sites were used as background. Finally, motifs from expressed TFs were filtered to those expressed in a previous retina transcriptome study ( ). \n\n\n### Characterization of retinal eQTLs \n  \nThe 14,859 eQTLs identified previously  were classified based on the location of the variants relative to the canonical TSS of the associated eGene from Ensembl 102. Expression quantitative trait loci variants located within \u00b12.5\u2009kb of the eGene TSS were identified as promoter eQTLs while those located >2.5\u2009kb from the eGene were identified as distal eQTLs. One hundred sets of random TADs of the same count and mean length as the real TADs were generated using regioneR v1.26.1 . For each set of TADs, real and random, we determined what proportion of eQTL variants resided within the same TAD as their associated eGene TSS. Next, eQTL variants which overlap a chromatin loop foot were classified based on the location contacted by opposite loop foot; variants in contact with their eGene promoter were identified as eGene pieQTLs, variants in contact with a promoter other than the eGene as non-eGene pieQTLs, and variants not in contact with any promoter as eQTL only. Finally, eQTLs were checked for overlap with CREs and SEs then subsequently checked if those regions overlapped the associated eGene. All overlaps were performed using GenomicRanges v1.42  in R. \n\n\n### Identification of linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants for AMD and Glaucoma GWAS loci \n  \nFifty-two AMD associated variants distributed across 34 loci and 127 glaucoma associated variants and loci were considered for the analysis . We calculated linkage disequilibrium (LD) for 52 AMD lead genetic variants and for 127 glaucoma lead variants within 1 MB using LDlink v5.1, among individuals with Europe ancestry from 1000 Genomes Project data . Using hg38 coordinates, we identified 65,625 AMD variants and 188,465 glaucoma variants in LD; of these, 1,196 filtered AMD variants and 12,658 filtered glaucoma variants in LD with MAF\u2009\u2265\u20091% and r \u2009\u2265\u20090.7 were selected for further analysis. \n\n\n### Identification of AMD and Glaucoma GWAS loci target genes \n  \nThe closest target genes overlapping with loops, CRE, SE, 52 AMD lead variants, 1,196 filtered AMD LD variants, 127 glaucoma lead variants and 12,658 filtered glaucoma LD variants were obtained using the closestBed command from bedtools v2.29.2 . Gene and TSS hg38 coordinates from Ensembl version 102 were used to overlap with the coordinates of the 52 AMD lead variants, 1,196 filtered AMD LD variants, 127 glaucoma lead variants and 12,658 filtered glaucoma LD variants. For a loop target gene, one foot of the loop overlaps the AMD/glaucoma GWAS lead variants or filtered AMD/glaucoma LD variants, and the second foot of the loop overlaps the gene body or TSS of a gene. CRE and SE target genes were defined by both the AMD/Glaucoma GWAS lead variant (or filtered AMD/glaucoma LD variant) and the gene body (or TSS of a gene) overlapping the same CRE. \n\n\n### Figure plots \n  \nContact maps were plotted using the Washington University Epigenome browser  or using HOMER  and R v3.6 and v4.0.3. Chromatin profiles and chromatin loops were plotted using IGV v2.11.9 . Graphs were plotted using R v3.6 and v4.0.3, ggplot2 v3.3.5 and dplyr v1.07 and ComplexHeatmap v2.7.10.9002. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9547065, "text_md5": "69602139c121eeae1ed2f5c6e54b1d20", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 138], "journal": [139, 149], "publication_year": [151, 155], "title": [166, 310], "keywords": [324, 376], "abstract": [389, 1866], "body": [1875, 64413]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 36207300, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-022-33427-1", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547065", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9547065"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547065\">9547065</a>", "list_title": "PMC9547065  High-resolution genome topology of human retina uncovers super enhancer-promoter interactions at tissue-specific and multifactorial disease loci"}

This fate specification hinges on a balance of transcriptional control. Here we report that expression of the transcription factor RUNX1 is enriched in the fetal ovary in rainbow trout, turtle, mouse, goat, and human. In the mouse, RUNX1 marks the supporting cell lineage and becomes pre-granulosa cell-specific as the gonads differentiate. RUNX1 plays complementary/redundant roles with FOXL2 to maintain fetal granulosa cell identity and combined loss of RUNX1 and FOXL2 results in masculinization of fetal ovaries. At the chromatin level, RUNX1 occupancy overlaps partially with FOXL2 occupancy in the fetal ovary, suggesting that RUNX1 and FOXL2 target common sets of genes. These findings identify RUNX1, with an ovary-biased expression pattern conserved across species, as a regulator in securing the identity of ovarian-supporting cells and the ovary. \n  \nProper ovarian differentiation requires RUNX1. Here, the authors show that double\u00a0knockout of   Runx1/Foxl2   results in masculinization of fetal ovaries, and that RUNX1 and FOXL2 jointly occupy common chromatin regions to\u00a0maintain pre-granulosa cell identity in the fetal ovary. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA critical step that shapes the reproductive identity of the embryo is the sexual differentiation of the bipotential gonads. Supporting cells in the fetal gonads are the first cell population to differentiate and dictate the fate of the gonads. As a consequence, defects in supporting cell differentiation have dire consequences on reproductive outcomes of the individual, from sex reversal to infertility. Supporting cells differentiate into either Sertoli cells, which drive testis development, or pre-granulosa cells, which control ovarian development. It has become clear that supporting cell differentiation and maintenance of their commitment requires a coordinated action of multiple factors that play either complementary, redundant, and even antagonistic roles . For instance, fate decision and maintenance of ovarian identity relies mainly on two conserved elements: the WNT4/RSPO1/\u03b2-catenin pathway  and the transcription factor FOXL2 . These two elements synergistically promote expression of pro-ovarian genes and, at the same time, antagonize key pro-testis factors such as SOX9 and DMRT1. However, the combined loss of these two key pro-ovarian signaling only results in an incomplete inactivation of ovarian differentiation, suggesting that additional pro-ovarian factors are at play during gonadal differentiation . Factors involved in gonad differentiation are generally conserved in vertebrates and even invertebrates, although their position in the hierarchy of the molecular cascade may change during evolution . For instance, the pro-ovarian transcription factor FOXL2 is important for ovarian differentiation/function in human , goat , and fish . The pro-testis transcription factor DMRT1 is highly conserved and critical for testis development in worms, fly , fish , and mammals . \n\nIn this study, we set up to investigate the role of transcription factor RUNX1 in the mouse fetal ovary. In   Drosophila melanogaster  , the   RUNX   ortholog   runt   is essential for ovarian determination . In the mouse,   Runx1   mRNA is enriched in the fetal ovary based on transcriptomic analyses . The RUNX family arose early in evolution: members have been identified in metazoans from sponge to human, where they play conserved key roles in developmental processes. In vertebrates, RUNX1 acts as a transcription factor critical for cell lineage specification in multiple organs and particularly in cell populations of epithelial origin . We first characterize the expression profile of   RUNX1   in the fetal gonads in multiple vertebrate species, from fish to human. We then use knockout (KO) mouse models and genomic approaches to determine the function and molecular action of RUNX1 and its interplay with another conserved ovarian regulator, FOXL2, during supporting cell differentiation in the fetal ovary. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Runx1   expression pattern implies a role in ovary development \n  \nThe   runt   gene, critical for ovarian determination in the fly , has three orthologs in mammals:   RUNX1  ,   RUNX2  , and   RUNX3  . Although all three RUNX transcription factors bind the same DNA motif, they are known to have distinct, tissue-specific functions . In the mouse,   Runx1   was the only one with a strong expression in the fetal ovary, whereas   Runx2   and   Runx3   were expressed weakly in the fetal gonads in a non-sexually dimorphic way (Fig.\u00a0 ). At the onset of sex determination (Embryonic day 11.5 or\u00a0 E11.5),   Runx1   expression was similar in both fetal XY (testis) and XX (ovary) gonads before becoming ovary-specific after E12.5 (Fig.\u00a0 ), consistent with observations by others . An ovary-enriched expression of   Runx1   during the window of early gonad differentiation was also observed in other mammals such as human and goat, as well as in species belonging to other classes of vertebrates such as red-eared slider turtle and rainbow trout (Fig.\u00a0 ), implying an evolutionarily conserved role of RUNX1 in ovary differentiation.   \n RUNX1   expression during gonadal differentiation in various vertebrates.   a   Expression of   Runx1  ,   Runx2  , and   Runx3   mRNAs in XX and XY gonads of E14.5 mouse embryos (  n  \u2009=\u20095/sex).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nTo identify the cell types that express   Runx1   in the gonads, we examined a reporter mouse model that produces enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of   Runx1   promoter  (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Consistent with   Runx1   mRNA expression (Fig.\u00a0 ),   Runx1-  EGFP was present in both XX and XY gonads at E11.5, then increased in XX gonads and diminished in XY gonads at E12.5 onwards (Fig.\u00a0 ). At E11.5 in both XX and XY gonads,   Runx1  -EGFP was present in a subset of SF1+/PECAM\u2212 somatic cell population, whereas it was absent in the SF1\u2212/PECAM+ germ cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). In the XY gonads, these   Runx1  -EGFP+ somatic cells corresponded to Sertoli cells, as demonstrated by a complete overlap with SRY, the sex-determining factor that drives Sertoli cell differentiation  (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). At this stage, there is no marker for ovarian-supporting cells that allow us to determine which subset of somatic cells were positive for   Runx1  -EGFP in XX gonads. However, at E12.5, when the sex of gonads becomes morphologically distinguishable,   Runx1  -EGFP was specifically detected in the supporting cell lineage of both sexes: strongly in FOXL2+ pre-granulosa cells of XX gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ) and weakly in SOX9+ Sertoli cells of XY gonads (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ).   Runx1  -EGFP expression was eventually turned off in the fetal testis, while it was maintained in the ovary (Fig.\u00a0 ). Throughout fetal development of the ovary,   Runx1  -EGFP remained in FOXL2+ pre-granulosa cells (Fig.\u00a0 ).   Runx1  -EGFP was also detected in the ovarian surface epithelium at E16.5 and birth (arrows in Fig.\u00a0 ), which gives rise to granulosa cells in the cortex of the ovary .   Runx1  -EGFP was also expressed in somatic cells of the cortical region right underneath the surface epithelium at E16.5 and some of these   Runx1  -EGFP+ cells presented a weak expression of FOXL2 (Fig.\u00a0 , arrowheads). In summary,   Runx1   marks the supporting cell lineage in the gonads at the onset of sex determination and becomes pre-granulosa cell-specific as gonads differentiate.   \n Runx1   is expressed in the supporting cells during gonad differentiation.   a  \u2013  g   Whole-mount immunofluorescence of XY and XX gonads from Tg(Runx1-EGFP) reporter mice at E11.5 and E12.5.

To investigate its role in gonads and avoid early embryonic lethality as a result of global deletion of   Runx1  , we generated a conditional KO mouse model in which   Runx1   was ablated in the SF1+ gonadal somatic cells  (Fig.\u00a0 ). We characterized the effects of   Runx1   inactivation on XX gonad differentiation at E14.5, a stage where morphological differences between ovary and testis are already established. Although   Runx1   expression was ablated successfully in XX gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ), ovarian morphogenesis appeared normal: E14.5 XX   Runx1   KO gonads presented similar size and shape compared with XX control gonads (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), and differentiation and organization of different gonadal cell populations were similar to control XX gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ). For instance, XX   Runx1   KO-supporting cells expressed the pre-granulosa cell marker FOXL2 but not Sertoli cell markers SOX9 and AMH (Fig.\u00a0 ). Supporting cells and germ-cell organization was similar to XX control gonads and did not form Laminin-outlined cord structures typical of testis differentiation (Fig.\u00a0 ). Similar to supporting cells, no difference was observed in the COUP-TFII+ interstitium organization between XX   Runx1   KO and XX control gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ). Finally, E14.5 XX   Runx1   KO germ cells had initiated meiosis, a typical feature of fetal ovary development, and normal expression of the germ-cell marker   Mvh   was observed (Fig.\u00a0 ). No significant change was detected for key genes involved in pre-granulosa cell differentiation (  Foxl2   and   Wnt4  ) or Sertoli cell differentiation (  Sox9  ,   Fgf9  ,   Nr5a1  , and   Amh  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). However, pre-granulosa cell marker   Fst   and fetal Sertoli cell marker desert hedgehog (  Dhh  ) were mis-expressed in E14.5 XX   Runx1   KO gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nInactivation of   Runx1   in the ovarian somatic cells has minimal impacts on morphogenesis of the ovary with the exception of transcriptomes.\u00a0Immunofluorescences for   a   pre-granulosa cell marker FOXL2, Sertoli cell marker SOX9, and germ-cell marker TRA98;   b   interstitial cell marker COUP-TFII (encoded by   Nr2f2   gene), Laminin, and Sertoli cell marker AMH;   c   meiotic cell marker SYCP3 and germ-cell marker TRA98 in E14.5 XX control, XX   Runx1   KO, and XY control gonads.

Values are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. One-way ANOVA,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. Bars with different letters (  a  ,   b  ) are significantly different. For all experiments, controls are wild-type littermates of   Runx1   KO mice. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. For the immunofluorescences, at least three independent biological replicates were analyzed and the images presented are representative of all replicates \n  \n\nSimilarly, at birth, XX   Runx1   KO gonads maintained a typical ovarian shape, with FOXL2+ pre-granulosa cells scattered throughout the gonad and TRA98+ germ cells located mostly in the cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). Despite their normal ovarian morphology, newborn XX   Runx1   KO gonads exhibited an aberrant transcriptomic profile reminiscent of the transcriptome of newborn XX   Foxl2   KO gonads, such as downregulation of pro-ovarian genes that are direct targets of FOXL2 (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ).   Foxl2   is involved in ovarian differentiation/maintenance in various vertebrate species. In the mouse, loss of   Foxl2   results in normal ovarian morphogenesis at birth, despite aberrant ovarian transcriptome, and eventually leads to masculinization of the ovary postnatally . We found that 41% of the genes differentially expressed in   Runx1   KO were also misregulated in the absence of   Foxl2   in newborn XX gonads (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). However, contrary to   Foxl2   KO, loss of   Runx1   in the ovary did not result in postnatal sex reversal and the females   Runx1   KO were fertile. One possible explanation for these common transcriptomic changes is that   Runx1   could be part of the same signaling cascade as   Foxl2  . However, analysis of   Runx1   expression in   Foxl2   KO newborn ovaries did not detect any changes in   Runx1   expression in the absence of   Foxl2   (Fig.\u00a0 ). Conversely,   Foxl2   expression was not changed in the absence of   Runx1  . These results indicate that   Runx1   and   Foxl2   regulate common sets of genes but they are themselves regulated independently of each other in the fetal ovary. \n\n\n###  Runx1   and   Foxl2   double knockout\u00a0results in partial\u00a0masculinization of fetal ovaries \n  \nThe common transcriptomic changes identified in   Runx1   and   Foxl2   KO newborn ovaries raised the question whether RUNX1 and FOXL2 could play redundant/complementary roles in supporting cell differentiation. We therefore generated   Runx1/Foxl2   double KO mice (referred as DKO) and compared XX gonads differentiation in the absence of   Runx1  ,   Foxl2  , or both (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Figs.\u00a0  and  ). Abnormal development of XX DKO gonads became apparent around E15.5. At this stage, differentiation of supporting cells into Sertoli cells in the testis or pre-granulosa cells in the ovary has been established. For instance, the transcription factor DMRT1, involved in the maintenance of Sertoli cell identity , is expressed in Sertoli cells but not pre-granulosa cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). At E15.5, DMRT1 is also present in a few germ cells in both the testis and ovary . Similar to control ovaries, XX gonads lacking either   Runx1   or   Foxl2   had no DMRT1 proteins in the supporting cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). However, the combined loss of   Runx1   and   Foxl2   resulted in aberrant expression of DMRT1 in the supporting cells of XX gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ). At birth, a time when XX   Foxl2   KO gonads still morphologically resemble ovaries , XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO gonads formed structures similar to fetal testis cords in the center, with DMRT1+ cells surrounding clusters of germ cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). Such structure was not observed in XX   Runx1   KO or   Foxl2   KO gonads with the exception that DMRT1 protein started to appear in a few supporting cells in the newborn XX   Foxl2   KO gonads, in what appears to be one of the first signs of postnatal masculinization of   Foxl2   KO ovaries at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0 ). Contrary to DMRT1, SOX9 protein, a key driver of Sertoli cell differentiation , was not detected in XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO newborn gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ). Our results demonstrate that a combined loss of   Runx1  /  Foxl2   induces partial masculinization of the supporting cells during fetal development of the ovary.   \nCombined loss of   Runx1   and   Foxl2   masculinizes the fetal ovaries.   a  \u2013  j   Immunofluorescence for Sertoli cell and germ-cell marker DMRT1, germ-cell marker TRA98, and granulosa cell marker FOXL2 in XX control, XX   Runx1   KO, XX   Foxl2   KO, XX   Runx1/Foxl2   double knockout, and XY control gonads at E15.5 (  a  \u2013  e  ) and at birth (  f  \u2013  j  ).

Scale bar: 50\u2009\u00b5m. At least three independent biological replicates were analyzed and the images presented are representative of all replicates \n  \n\nTo further characterize the impacts of the combined loss of   Runx1  /  Foxl2   on ovarian differentiation, we compared the transcriptome of newborn XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO gonads with the transcriptomes of XX control,   Runx1  , or   Foxl2   single KO gonads (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). The heat map for the 918 differentially expressed genes between XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO and XX control gonads demonstrated allele-specific impacts: loss of   Runx1   resulted in a mild and often nonsignificant effect on these genes, loss of   Foxl2   had an intermediate/strong effect, and combined loss of   Runx1/Foxl2   yielded the strongest effect (fold change\u2009>\u20091.5;   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the downregulated genes were associated with \u201covarian follicle development\u201d and \u201cfemale gonad development,\u201d whereas \u201cmale sex determination\u201d was the most significantly enriched process for the upregulated genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Conforming to the hierarchical clustering (Fig.\u00a0 ), comparison of the genes significantly changed in   Runx1/Foxl2   single and DKOs suggested that   Foxl2   was the main contributor to the transcriptional changes observed in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ): 61% of the genes downregulated in DKO were also downregulated in   Foxl2   KO and 43% of the genes upregulated in DKO were also upregulated in   Foxl2   KO. In addition, some genes appeared to be controlled by both   Foxl2   and   Runx1  , and were significantly downregulated or upregulated in all three KOs (Fig.\u00a0 ). For instance, the genes   Fst   and   Cyp19a  , both involved in granulosa cell differentiation/function , were downregulated in   Runx1   KO,   Foxl2   KO, and more repressed in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO (Fig.\u00a0 ). On the other hand,   Dhh   was upregulated in all three KOs, with the highest expression in the DKO (Fig.\u00a0 ). Finally, some genes were significantly changed in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO only, suggesting a cumulative effect of   Runx1   and   Foxl2   loss. For instance,   Foxp1  , a gene whose expression is enriched in pre-granulosa cells , was significantly downregulated only in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO (Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas   Fgf9  , a Sertoli gene contributing to testis differentiation , and   Pdgfc   were significantly upregulated only in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nTranscriptomic analysis of XX   Runx1  /  Foxl2   single and double KO ovaries.   a   Heat map for the 918 genes differentially expressed in XX   Runx1/Foxl2   double knockout (DKO) vs. XX control (Ctr) gonads at birth.

Bars with different letters (  a  ,   b  ,   c  ) are significantly different. Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\n In contrast to\u00a0XX   Foxl2   single KO gonads (Fig.\u00a0 ), in which sex reversal only became apparent postnatally , XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO gonads exhibited masculinization with visible morphological changes before birth. To determine how the additional loss of   Runx1   contributed to the earlier masculinization of   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries, we identified the genes differentially expressed between XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO and XX   Foxl2   KO gonads (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Expression of most of these genes was already altered in XX   Foxl2   single KO gonads; however, the additional loss of   Runx1   exacerbated their mis-expression. For instance, the pro-testis gene   Dmrt1   and   Nr5a1   were significantly upregulated, whereas the pre-granulosa-cell-enriched transcripts   Fst   and   Ryr2   were further downregulated at birth (Fig.\u00a0 ). On the other hand, the additional loss of   Runx1   did not cause further upregulation of the Sertoli genes   Sox9   and   Amh   at birth, suggesting that   Runx1   does not contribute to their repression in the ovary (Fig.\u00a0 ). Overall, the transcriptomic analyses of   Runx1/Foxl2   single and DKOs revealed that   Foxl2   is the main driver of the transcriptomic changes, and that the additional loss of   Runx1   amplifies the mis-expression of genes already altered by the sole loss of   Foxl2  , leading to the failure to maintain pre-granulosa cell identity in the fetal ovary. \n\n\n### RUNX1 shares genome-wide chromatin occupancy with FOXL2 \n  \nThe masculinization of XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO fetal gonads and the transcriptomic comparisons of newborn XX   Runx1/Foxl2   single and DKO gonads suggest some interplay between RUNX1 and FOXL2 to control pre-granulosa cell identity. The fact that RUNX1 and FOXL2 are both transcription factors expressed in the pre-granulosa cells (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ) raised the question whether this interplay could occur directly at the chromatin level. We have previously identified FOXL2 chromatin occupancy during ovarian differentiation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by whole-genome sequencing  at E14.5, a time where FOXL2 and RUNX1 expression fully overlaps (Fig.\u00a0 ). We performed additional de novo motif analyses on the genomic regions bound by FOXL2 in the fetal ovary, and discovered that several other DNA motifs were co-enriched with FOXL2 DNA motif (Fig.\u00a0 ). RUNX DNA motif was the second most significantly co-enriched motif. The other motifs were for CTCF, a factor involved in transcriptional regulation, enhancer insulation, and chromatin architecture , and for the DNA motif recognized by members of the nuclear receptor family including liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1 encoded by   Nr5a2  ) and SF1 (encoded by   Nr5a1  ), a known co-factor of FOXL2 . DNA motifs for TEAD transcription factors of the Hippo pathway, ETS, NFYA, and GATA4, another factor involved in gonad differentiation , were also significantly enriched. The enrichment of RUNX motif with FOXL2-binding motif suggests that RUNX1, the only RUNX also expressed in pre-granulosa cells, could bind similar genomic regions to FOXL2 in the fetal ovary. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for RUNX1 in E14.5 ovaries (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ), the same stage as\u00a0 FOXL2 ChIP-seq . The top de novo motif identified in RUNX1 ChIP-seq (  p  \u2009<\u20091e\u2009\u2212\u2009559) matched the RUNX motif  (Fig.\u00a0 ) and corresponded to the motif that was co-enriched with FOXL2 in FOXL2 ChIP-seq (Fig.\u00a0 ). A total of 10,494 RUNX1-binding peaks were identified in the fetal ovary, with the majority of the peaks located either in the gene body (Fig.\u00a0 ; 25% exon and 22% intron) or close upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (30% Promoter:\u2009<\u20091\u2009kb of TSS; 12% Upstream: \u221210 to \u22121\u2009kb of TSS). Comparison of genome-wide chromatin binding of RUNX1 and FOXL2 in the fetal ovary revealed significant overlap: 54% (5619/10,494) of RUNX1 peaks overlapped with FOXL2 peaks (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nRUNX1 and FOXL2 exhibit overlaps in chromatin binding in fetal ovaries.   a   de novo motif analysis of FOXL2 peaks identifies enrichment of RUNX motif along with FOXL2 motif in E14.5 ovaries.   b   The top de novo motif for RUNX1 ChIP-seq in E14.5 ovaries corresponds to a RUNX motif.   c   Distribution of genomic location of the 10,494 RUNX1-binding peaks.

To identify potential direct target genes of RUNX1 or/and FOXL2, we focused on the 918 genes differentially expressed in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries and determined which genes were nearest to RUNX1 or/and FOXL2-binding peaks (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). More than 50% of these genes (492/918; Fig.\u00a0 ) were the closest gene to RUNX1 or/and FOXL2 peaks. Some of these genes were nearest to only FOXL2 peaks (116 genes in Fig.\u00a0 ). For example,   Pla2r1  , a transcript enriched in pre-granulosa cells  and similarly downregulated in both   Foxl2   KO and   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO fetal ovaries (Fig.\u00a0 ), contained two FOXL2-specific peaks, one in the promoter and one in the first intron. On the other hand, 102 genes (Fig.\u00a0 ) had RUNX1-specific peaks near their genomic locations. For instance,   Ryr2  , another transcript enriched in pre-granulosa cells , was strongly downregulated in both   Runx1   KO and   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO fetal and newborn ovaries (Figs.\u00a0  and  ), and contained one RUNX1-specific peak in its intronic region. Finally, 274 genes were the closest genes to the peaks for both RUNX1 and FOXL2, with the majority of them (197 genes) nearest to overlapping peaks for RUNX1 and FOXL2 (Fig.\u00a0 ). Most of these genes were downregulated in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries (Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). For instance, the pre-granulosa cell-enriched genes   Fst   and   Itpr2  , both downregulated in   Runx1/Foxl2   single and DKO ovaries (Figs.\u00a0  and  ), contained common binding peaks for FOXL2 and RUNX1 (Fig.\u00a0 ). For   Fst  , this binding of RUNX1 and FOXL2 was located in its first intron, in the previously identified regulatory region that contributes to its expression . On the other hand, Sertoli cell -enriched\u00a0gene   Dmrt1  , which was\u00a0strongly upregulated in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO (Figs.\u00a0  and  ), contained a common binding site for FOXL2 and RUNX1 near its promoter (Fig.\u00a0 ). Taken together, our results reveal that RUNX1, a transcription factor expressed in the fetal ovary of various vertebrate species, contributes to ovarian differentiation and maintenance of pre-granulosa cell identity through an interplay with FOXL2 that occurs at the chromatin level.   \nIdentification of potential direct target genes for RUNX1 and/or FOXL2.   a   Pie-chart identifying the genes significantly changed in XX   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO gonads that are nearest to peaks for FOXL2 and/or RUNX1.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe molecular events that specify pre-granulosa cell fate are complex and nonlinear, involving several signaling pathways that have redundant and complementary functions. This is in contrast to the fetal testis, where the molecular pathway driving its differentiation appears linear and sequential. Removal of one of the top pieces in the testis differentiation pathway has a domino effect that prevents induction of downstream events. This is exemplified by the complete gonadal sex reversal in gain- or loss-of-function mouse models for SRY or SOX9, the two transcription factors responsible for the initiation of the testis morphogenesis . This is not the case in the mouse ovary, where no single-gene loss/mutation results in a complete ovary-to-testis sex reversal. For instance, defects in the WNT4/RSPO1/\u03b2-catenin pathway\u00a0or loss of   Foxl2   causes a late or postnatal partial ovary-to-testis sex reversal, whereas the combined loss of   Foxl2   and elements of the WNT4/RSPO1/\u03b2-catenin pathway (  Wnt4   or   Rspo1  ) leads to ovary-to-testis sex reversal more pronounced than each single KO model in the mouse . In this study, we demonstrated that   Runx1   contributes to the molecular network controlling pre-granulosa cell differentiation. Loss of   Runx1   in somatic cells of the ovaries altered ovarian transcriptome but did not affect ovarian morphogenesis during fetal development. In contrast, combined loss of   Runx1   and   Foxl2   compromised pre-granulosa cell identity. Loss of   Runx1   or   Foxl2   affected common sets of genes, suggesting some redundancy in their functions in the fetal ovary. These transcriptomic changes were enhanced in the absence of both genes, reaching a threshold that masculinized the fetal ovary. Based on the phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses, we propose that FOXL2 is the dominant player and RUNX1 acts as a supporting player. For instance, global KO of   Foxl2   in XX gonads results in postnatal sex reversal , whereas the XX   Runx1   single KO has no such impacts. In addition, loss of   Foxl2   leads to\u00a0transcriptomic changes more prominent\u00a0than loss of   Runx1   in newborn ovaries, even though they affect common sets of genes. However, the additional loss of   Runx1   amplifies the transcriptomic changes caused by the loss of   Foxl2  , resulting in fetal masculinization. One of the most striking changes in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries is\u00a0the expression of DMRT1 in the fetal supporting cells. DMRT1 is a key driver of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development in various species . In the fly,   doublesex   (  dsx  ), an ortholog of mammalian   DMRT1  , controls testis differentiation . Intriguingly,   runt  , the fly ortholog of   RUNX1  , tips the balance toward ovarian determination by antagonizing the testis-specific transcriptional regulation of   dsx  . In the mouse, testis differentiation is not controlled by DMRT1 but by SOX transcription factor SRY and its direct target SOX9. However, RUNX1 does not appear to contribute to the repression of the key pro-testis gene   Sox9   in the fetal ovary and SOX9 protein was not detected in   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovary at birth. This is in contrast with the phenotype of   Wnt4/Foxl2   DKO newborn ovaries where SOX9 was upregulated, and as a consequence the ovaries were more masculinized . Overall, our findings suggest that slightly different pro-ovarian networks control the repression of the evolutionary conserved pro-testis genes   Sox9   and   Dmrt1  :   Sox9  , which plays a primary role in Sertoli cell differentiation in the mouse, is repressed by an interplay between the WNT4/RSPO1/\u03b2-catenin and FOXL2 . On the other hand,   Dmrt1  , which has taken a secondary role in Sertoli cell differentiation in the mouse, is repressed by an interplay between RUNX1 and FOXL2. The fact that RUNX1 does not appear to control   Sox9   may be the reason why RUNX1 only plays a secondary role in granulosa cell differentiation/maintenance, in contrast to the dominant roles of the WNT pathway and FOXL2. It would be interesting to determine the role of RUNX1 in species for which DMRT1 plays a more prominent role in initiation of differentiation of the testis. \n\nSeeking the mechanisms underlying the interplay between RUNX1 and FOXL2 in the regulation of pre-granulosa cell identity, we identified that RUNX DNA-binding motif is significantly co-enriched with FOXL2 motif in genomic regions bound by FOXL2 in the fetal ovary. The fact that RUNX1 genome-wide chromatin occupancy partially overlaps with FOXL2 in the fetal ovary, that RUNX1 and FOXL2 are expressed in the same cells at the time of the ChIP-seqs, that their loss affects common set of genes, and that the DKO results in gonad masculinization, altogether support the model in which RUNX1 and FOXL2 jointly occupy common chromatin regions that control the maintenance of pre-granulosa cell identity. By themselves, RUNX proteins are weak transcription factors and they require other transcriptional regulators to function as either repressors or activators of transcription . Interplay between RUNX1 and several members of the forkhead transcription factor family has been documented in different tissues. For instance, RUNX1 is a co-activator of FOXO3 in hepatic cells . Similarly, an interplay between RUNX1 and FOXO1/FOXO3 was demonstrated in breast epithelial cells where a subset of FOXO target genes were jointly regulated with RUNX1 . Another forkhead protein, FOXP3, acts with RUNX1 to control gene expression in T cells  and breast epithelial cells . Such cooperation in various tissues suggest that the interplay between RUNXs and forkhead transcription factors maybe an evolutionary conserved phenomenon. It would be interesting to determine whether the forkhead protein FOXL2 is also able to physically interact with RUNX1 in the fetal ovaries and how this interaction occurs. Our data and single-cell sequencing data  demonstrate that RUNX1 starts to be expressed in the supporting cells earlier than FOXL2. In other tissues, it was demonstrated that RUNX1 can function as a pioneer factor that allows chromatin remodeling and recruitment of other factors to control gene expression and cell fate . Therefore, it is possible that RUNX1 is first recruited to\u00a0chromatin regions and the presence of RUNX1 facilitates the recruitment of FOXL2 to maintain pre-granulosa cell identity. Finally, in addition to the genes co-regulated by FOXL2 and RUNX1, we identified genes that were specifically mis-expressed in the absence of   Runx1   but not   Foxl2  . Genome-wide analyses of RUNX1 binding in the fetal ovary also identified genomic regions bound by RUNX1 but not FOXL2. These results suggest that RUNX1 could also contribute to ovarian development or function independently of FOXL2. \n\nRUNX1 contributes to cell-fate determination in various developmental processes such as hematopoiesis and hair follicle development. Depending on its interplay with other signal transduction pathways or co-factors, RUNX1 controls which path the precursor cells take when they are at the crossroad between cell proliferation/renewal and lineage-specific commitment . We discovered that   Runx1   has an ovary-biased expression during gonad differentiation in various vertebrate species, including turtle, rainbow trout, goat, mouse, and human. In mouse embryonic gonads,   Runx1   is first detected in the supporting cells in a non-sexually dimorphic way at the onset of sex determination. Although its expression is maintained in the ovary,   Runx1   appears to be actively repressed in the testis between E11.5 and E12.5 as the supporting cells commit to Sertoli cell fate. The suppression of   Runx1   in the fetal testis is corroborated by previously published data from a time-course transcriptomic analysis during early gonad development  and single-cell sequencing analysis of SF1+ progenitor cells . The time course of Sertoli cell differentiation at the single-cell level revealed that   Runx1   follows a similar\u00a0spatiotemporal pattern of expression with   Sry  . In the mouse,   Sry   expression in Sertoli cells is quickly turned off after the initiation of testis differentiation and it is suspected that the repression of   Sry   is due to a negative feedback loop by downstream pro-testis genes. The similar pattern of downregulation of   Runx1   in the testis after E11.5 raises the possibility that   Runx1   is downregulated by a similar signaling pathway. Regulation of   Runx1   gene expression is complex and several enhancers that confer tissue-specific expression have been identified . It remains to be determined how   Runx1   expression is controlled in the gonads and how it is actively repressed in the fetal testis. \n\nIn contrary to the testes, fetal ovaries maintain expression of   Runx1   in the supporting cells as they differentiate into pre-granulosa cells. During ovarian differentiation, granulosa cells arise from two different waves: the first cohort of granulosa cells arises from the bipotential supporting cell precursors that differentiate into either Sertoli cells or pre-granulosa cells during sex determination . The second wave of granulosa cells that eventually populate the cortical region of the ovary appears later in gestation. This second wave arises from LGR5+ cells of the ovarian surface epithelium that ingress into the ovary from E15.5 to postnatal day 4 and eventually become LGR5-/FOXL2+ granulosa cells . This timing of establishment of the second cohort of granulosa cells correlates with the expression of   Runx1-  EGFP in a subset of cells in the surface epithelium and in granulosa cells of the ovarian cortex at E16.5 and birth. These results suggest that   Runx1   also\u00a0marks granulosa cell precursors that will give rise to the second wave of FOXL2+ granulosa cells in the cortex. Therefore, both expression at onset of sex determination and at the surface epithelium/cortex at the time of the second wave of granulosa cells recruitment suggest that   Runx1   is activated in cells that are primed to become supporting/granulosa cells. \n\nMultiple transcription factors often form complex genetic regulatory networks that control cell-fate determination. Genomic sequence motifs or cis-regulatory elements for the supporting cell lineage in the testis were identified by combined analyses of SOX9 and DMRT1 ChIP-seq, and by motif prediction . These \u201cSertoli cell signatures\u201d are composed of binding motifs for transcription factors critical for Sertoli cell differentiation, including SOX9, GATA4, and DMRT1. These Sertoli cell signatures, present in mammals and other vertebrates, could represent a conserved regulatory code that governs the cascade of Sertoli cell differentiation, regardless of whether it primarily relies on SOX transcription factors such as SRY in mammals or on DMRT1 such as in several vertebrate species. Similarly, one would expect the presence of conserved \u201cgranulosa cell signature\u201d \u00a0genomic regions that confers granulosa cell differentiation. As FOXL2 is a highly conserved gene in granulosa cell differentiation in vertebrates, we used FOXL2 as an anchor factor to identify other factors that could take part in the regulatory network controlling granulosa cell differentiation/function. Unbiased analyses of the motifs co-enriched with FOXL2 motif in the fetal ovary identified the RUNX motif as one of the most co-enriched motifs. In addition to the RUNX motif, motifs for CTCF, nuclear receptors SF1/LRH-1/ESRRB, and transcription factors TEADs and GATAs were also significantly enriched with FOXL2 consensus motif in FOXL2-bound chromatin regions. For many of these transcription factors, their potential role in gonad differentiation is unknown or limited. For example, the transcription factors of the TEAD family belong to the Hippo pathway, which is involved in the regulation of Sertoli cell gene expression in the fetal gonads . However, the potential involvement of the hippo pathway in granulosa cell differentiation has not been investigated. \n\nIn conclusion, we identified RUNX1 as a transcription factor involved in pre-granulosa cell differentiation/maintenance. RUNX1 first delineates the supporting cell lineage and then becomes pre-granulosa cell-specific during gonad development. RUNX1 plays redundant roles with FOXL2 through binding of common chromatin regions and control of common sets of genes to maintain pre-granulosa cell identity in the fetal ovary. Our findings provide insights into the genomic control of granulosa cell differentiation and pave the way for the identification of transcription factors and cis-signatures contributing to the fate determination of granulosa cells and the consequent formation of a functional ovary. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Mouse models \n  \nTg(  Runx1  -EGFP) reporter mouse was purchased from MMRRC (MMRRC_010771-UCD) and CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River (stock number 022).   Runx1   (B6.129S-  Runx1  /J) and   Runx1   (B6.129P2-  Runx1  /J) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (stock numbers 005669 and 008772, respectively).   Sf1  -Cre  mice  (B6D2-Tg(Nr5a1-cre)2Klp) were provided by late Dr. Keith Parker and   Foxl2   mice  (B6;129-Foxl2\u2009<\u2009tm1Gpil\u2009>\u2009) were provided by Dr. David Schlessinger (National Institute on Aging), respectively.   Runx1   KO mice (  Sf1Cre   ; Runx1  ) were generated by crossing   Runx1   females with   Sf1-Cre   ; Runx1   males. Controls were   Sf1-Cre   ; Runx1   littermates.   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO mice (  Sf1Cre   ; Runx1   ; Foxl2  ) were generated by crossing   Runx1   ; Foxl2   females with   Sf1Cre   ; Runx1   ; Foxl2   males. This cross also generated the single KOs for   Runx1   (  Sf1Cre   ; Runx1   ; Foxl2   )   and   Foxl2   (  Sf1Cre   ; Runx1   ; Foxl2  ), and control littermates (  Sf1-Cre   ; Runx1   ; Foxl2  ). Time-mating was set up by housing female mice with male mice overnight and the females were checked for the presence of vaginal plug the next morning. The day when the vaginal plug was detected was considered embryonic day or\u00a0E0.5. All experiments were performed on at least four animals for each genotype. All animal procedures were approved by the National Institutes of Health Animals Care and Use Committee, and were performed in accordance with an approved National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences animal study proposal. \n\n\n### Immunofluorescences \n  \nFor the Tg(  Runx1  -EGFP) mice, gonads were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1\u20132\u2009h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on whole gonads at E11.5 and E12.5, and on sections for E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and P0 (birth) gonads. The EGFP was detected in whole-mount gonads by direct fluorescent imaging and an anti-GFP antibody was used for immunofluorescences on sections. For the different KO models, gonads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C and immunofluorescence experiments were performed on paraffin sections of E14.5, E15.5, and P0 gonads as previously described . Briefly, the slides were rehydrated and citrate-based antigen retrieval was performed. The samples (slides or whole-mount samples) were blocked in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum/0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The samples were then incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C in the primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. The next day, the samples were washed three times in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature in the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. The samples were then washed and counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a0 . Whole gonads and sections were imaged under a Leica DMI4000 confocal microscope. For all immunofluorescence experiments, at least three independent biological replicates were analyzed and the image presented in the figures were representative of all replicates. \n\n\n### Real-time PCR analysis in the mouse \n  \nFor the time-course kinetics of   Runx1   expression, fetal gonads from CD-1 embryos at embryonic day E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, and postnatal day P3 were separated from the mesonephros and snap-frozen. For each stage, three biological replicates were collected, with six gonads/replicate for the E11.5 stage and three gonads/replicate for the other stages. For   Runx1   KO analysis, control and KO ovaries were collected at E14.5 (  n  \u2009=\u20094 biological replicates/genotype). For   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO analysis, control,   Runx1  , and   Foxl2   single and DKO ovaries were collected at E15.5 (  n  \u2009=\u20094/genotype) and P0 (  n  \u2009=\u20095/genotype). For all experiments, total RNA was isolated for each replicate using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA). RNA quality and concentration were determined using the Nanodrop 2000c and 300\u2013400\u2009ng of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the Superscript II cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR using Bio-Rad CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection system. Gene expression was normalized to   Gapdh  . The Taqman probes and primers used to detect transcript expression are listed in Supplementary Tables\u00a0  and  . Data were analyzed using Prism GraphPad Software by unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test or by ANOVA   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. Values are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. \n\n\n###  Runx1   expression in other species \n  \nFor the rainbow trout,   Runx1   expression during gonadal development was assessed by quantitative PCR . Species-specific primers used are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a0 . For the red-eared slider turtle,   Runx1   expression during gonadal development was assessed at Female-Promoting Temperature of 31\u2009\u00b0C and at Male-Promoting Temperature of 26\u2009\u00b0C by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) . For the goat,   Runx1   expression during gonadal development was assessed by quantitative PCR and two to three biological replicates were used for each stage of development . Values are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. All goat-handling procedures were conducted in compliance with the guidelines on the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching in France (Authorization number 91\u2013649 for the Principal Investigator, and national authorizations for all investigators. Approval from the Ethics Committee: 12/045). For the human,   Runx1   expression during gonadal development was assessed by RNA-seq. Human fetuses (6\u201312\u2009GW) were obtained from legally induced normally progressing terminations of pregnancy performed in Rennes University Hospital in France. Tissues were collected with women\u2019s written consent, in accordance with the legal procedure agreed by the National agency for biomedical research (authorization #PFS09-011; Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine) and the approval of the Local ethics committee of Rennes Hospital in France (advice # 11\u201348). \n\n\n### Microarray analysis \n  \nGene expression analysis of control,   Runx1   KO,   Foxl2   KO, and   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries was conducted using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip\u00ae arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) on four biological replicates (one P0 gonad per replicate) for each genotype. Fifty nanograms of total RNA were amplified and labeled as directed in the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System and Encore Biotin Module protocols. Amplified biotin-aRNA (4.6\u2009\u03bcg) was fragmented and hybridized to each array for 18\u2009h at 45\u2009\u00b0C in a rotating hybridization. Array slides were stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin utilizing a double-antibody staining procedure and then washed for antibody amplification according to the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit, and user manual following protocol FS450-0004. Arrays were scanned in an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 and data were obtained using the GeneChip\u00ae Command Console Software (AGCC; Version 3.2) and Expression Console (Version 1.2). Microarray data have been deposited in GEO under accession code  . Gene expression analyses were conducted with Partek software (St. Louis, Missouri) using a one-way ANOVA comparing the Robust Multichip Average (RMA)-normalized log2 intensities. A full dataset Excel file containing the normalized log2 intensity of all genes for each genotype and a graphic view of their expression is provided in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . In order to identify differentially expressed genes, ANOVA was used to determine whether there was a statistical difference between the means of groups and the gene lists were filtered with   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and fold-change cutoff of 1.5. The heat map was created comparing the genes that were significantly different between control and   Runx1/Foxl2   DKO ovaries. Venn diagrams were generated in Partek by comparing gene symbols between the lists of genes differentially expressed. \n\n\n### ChIP-seq assays and analysis \n  \nOvaries from E14.5 CD-1 embryos were separated from the mesonephros, snap-frozen, and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. RUNX1 ChIP-seq experiments and analyses in E14.5 ovaries were performed using the same protocol than FOXL2 ChIP-seq . Two independent ChIP-seq experiments were performed by Active Motif, Inc., using 20\u201330\u2009\u03bcg of sheared chromatin from pooled embryonic ovaries (  n  \u2009=\u2009100\u2013120 ovaries/ChIP) and 10\u2009\u03bcl of RUNX1 antibody  (provided by Drs Yoram Groner and Ditsa Levanon, the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel). ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced as single-end 75-mers by Illumina NextSeq 500, then filtered to retain only reads with average base quality score\u2009>\u200920. Reads were mapped against the mouse mm10 reference genome using Bowtie v1.2 with parameter \u201c-m 1\u201d to collect only uniquely mapped hits. Duplicate mapped reads were removed using Picard tools MarkDuplicates.jar (v1.110). The number of uniquely mapped non-duplicate reads for each biological replicate was 8,932,674 and 15,036,698. After merging the replicate datasets, binding regions were identified by peak calling using HOMER v.4.9  with a false discovery rate\u2009<\u20091e\u2009\u2212\u20095. Called peaks were subsequently re-defined as 300mers centered on the called peak midpoints and filtered for a fourfold enrichment over input and over local signal. Genomic distribution of RUNX1-bound regions was determined based on Refseq gene models as downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser as of 9 August 2017. Enriched motifs were identified using HOMER findMotifsGenome.pl de novo motif analysis with parameter \u201c-size given\u201d. For RUNX1 and FOXL2 ChIP-seq comparisons, binding peaks that had at least 1\u2009bp in common were considered overlapping. Peaks were assigned to the nearest gene based on RefSeq. Gene lists were analyzed for enrichment using the online tool EnrichR . The ChIP-seq data are available in the ReproGenomics Viewer ( )  and Gene Expression Omnibus ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6848188, "text_md5": "a617c293bea01e951aee3491a80b2321", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 207], "journal": [208, 218], "publication_year": [220, 224], "title": [235, 314], "keywords": [328, 381], "abstract": [394, 1701], "body": [1710, 54562]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31712577, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-13060-1", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6848188", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6848188"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6848188\">6848188</a>", "list_title": "PMC6848188  RUNX1 maintains the identity of the fetal ovary through an interplay with FOXL2"}

The\nmass production of spike glycoproteins is usually carried out in different\ncell systems. Studies have been shown that different expression cell\nsystems alter protein glycosylation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase\nin the influenza virus. However, it is not clear whether the cellular\nsystem affects the spike protein glycosylation. In this work, we investigated\nthe effect of an expression system on the glycosylation of the spike\nglycoprotein and its receptor-binding domain. We found that there\nare significant differences in the glycosylation and glycans attached\nat each glycosite of the spike glycoprotein obtained from different\nexpression cells. Since glycosylation at the binding site and adjacent\namino acids affects the interaction between the spike glycoprotein\nand the host cell receptor, we recognize that caution should be taken\nwhen selecting an expression system to develop inhibitors, antibodies,\nand vaccines. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSevere acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is\na strain of novel coronavirus that caused the 2019 pandemic disease\n(COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has close genetic similarity to bat coronavirus.\nSince its first appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2\nhas spread globally in a few months.  It\nwas confirmed by January 20, 2020, that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted\nfrom person to person through direct or indirect contact, such as\nrespiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes), airborne, fomite, and urine\nor feces. As of March 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused 2.7 million\ndeaths and 123.2 million cases worldwide. \n\nSimilar to the earlier\ncoronavirus strains middle east respiratory\nsyndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV that transmits to humans, SARS-CoV-2\nconsists of four structural proteins, called spike (S), envelope (E),\nmembrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S, E, and M proteins\ntogether form the viral envelope, while the N protein retains the\nRNA genome.  The entry of SARS-CoV-2 cells depends on\nthe binding of the viral S protein to the cell receptors and the S\nprotein triggered by the host cell proteases. Studies have shown that\nthe cell entry process engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\nto bind the S protein and uses transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)\nto trigger the S protein.  TMPRSS2 not only cleaves\nand activates the spike glycoprotein for membrane fusion but also\nsplits ACE2 into two to enhance viral infectivity.  Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly present in the respiratory\nsystem, digestive tract, and gastrointestinal tract (such as human\nairway epithelium),  bronchial transient secretory\ncells,  nasal epithelial cells,  human ocular surface,  and small intestine,  various routes\nof infection may occur when SARS-CoV-2 comes into contact with humans\nthrough any of these organs. Furin, another receptor highly expressed\nin the lungs, binds to the spike and cleaves the furin cleavage site\n(FCS) of SARS-CoV-2.  The presence of\nACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin in these cells and tissues may indicate that\nthere are multiple routes of transmission through their respective\nviral infections. \n\nThe spike glycoprotein of coronavirus plays\na key role in virus\ninfection, mediates virus entry, and is a primary determinant of cell\ntropism and pathogenesis.  The spike S1\nis the first possible point of contact for recognition and binding\nof host receptors (ACE2, Furin, or GRP78 via CD147 ), allowing subsequently conformational changes in S2, thereby\npromoting the fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell\nmembrane. According to reports, the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2\nS1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 is considerably higher than\nthat of SARS-CoV,  leading to severe infection and\nthe widespread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the mortality rate\nhas decreased from \u223c10% of SARS-CoV to 1\u20135% of SARS-CoV-2,\nthe number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 is substantially higher\nthan that of SARS-CoV, e.g., over 2.7 million for the former and 812\nfor the latter globally to date. Therefore, it is important to understand\nthe structure of the spike glycoprotein and the mechanism of infection. \n\nThe spike glycoprotein deploys S1 for attachment to the host cell\nand S2 for fusion. Obviously, the high affinity promotes the attachment\nof S1 to the host cell and increases the spread of the virus. The\ndetailed structural comparison of S1 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2\nshows that 10 regions in the S1 domain play critical roles in ACE2\nbinding; mutations in certain amino acid residues in these regions\nresult in low affinity of S1 to ACE2.  In\ncontrast, SARS-CoV-2 mutations on some amino acids may help enhance\naffinity, such as Y442 in SARS-CoV to L457 in SARS-CoV-2, N479 to\nQ493, Y484 to Q498.  Thus, any mutations\nin amino acid residues or post-translational modification (PTM) of\namino acids may affect the attachment of the spike S1 to the host\ncell receptors. Because the spike is a glycoprotein, its glycosylated\nvariants have a profound effect on the affinity and infectivity of\nSARS-CoV-2. Recent studies have identified 22 N-glycosites in the\nprotomer of the trimeric spike and have a high-density N-glycan mask\non the surface of the viral protein, similar to the S1 subunit of\nMERS-CoV.  Several studies have also detected trace\nlevels of O-glycosites at T323 and S325 of the spike glycoprotein  and T678 near FCS occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures.  Recent studies have identified 25 O-glycosites\nin the S1 of the spike glycoprotein expressed from HEK293 cells, of\nwhich 16 O-glycosites are located within the three amino acids from\nthe N-glycosites.  These results are consistent\nwith our predictions using ISOGlyP, indicating that S1 RBD is highly\nO-glycosylated in SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, as observed in the\ninfluenza viruses, when viral glycoproteins are expressed in different\ncell systems, their glycosylation can change.  Yet, it has not been studied whether the expression cell system\nhas an impact on the O-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD. \n\nIn\nthis study, we intend to comprehensively characterize N-linked\nand O-linked glycosylation of the spike S1 subunit of SARS-CoV and\nSARS-CoV-2 produced by different expression host cells. We recognize\nthat host expression may alter the glycosylation pattern of spike\nglycoproteins. HEK293 cells and baculovirus-insect system Hi5 cells\nare used for virus production and recombinant spike glycoprotein production\nin our work. The effect of host cell lines on viral protein glycosylation\nhas been reported. The influenza A virus glycoprotein can contain\nstructures of paucimannose (Sf9 cells), core-fucosylated bisected\nN-GlcNAc (embryonated hen egg), or sialylated biantennary glycans\n(HEK293).  baculovirus-insect cells, already\nused in influenza and human papillomavirus (HPV), is an ideal baculovirus\nexpression system for the production of recombinant spike glycoproteins\nand vaccines.  baculovirus-insect cells\ncan synthesize glycans with one or two core fucoses. There is a report\nof glucuronic acid (GlcA) in the cells,  even though other insect cells may have GlcA residues.  It should be investigated whether baculovirus-insect\ncells have GlcA and other glycans to analyze the glycosylation of\nthe spike glycoprotein. \n\nTo reveal these uncertainties, we compared\nthe S1 subunits of Spike\nexpressed in HEK293 cells and baculovirus-insect Hi5 cells ( ). The spike S1 was\ndigested with trypsin, and then glycopeptides were enriched using\nhydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The enriched\nglycopeptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\n(LC-MS/MS) using electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation\n(EThcD) fragments. In another experiment, N-glycans and O-glycans\nwere released from spike S1 and evaluated using a Bruker Autoflex\nMatrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI)-MS. \n   Recombinant Spike S1 Expressed in\nDifferent Expression Cells      \n\n## Results and Discussion \n  \n### Most Diverse\nMutations of Amino Acids Occurred in the S1 Domain\nof the Spike Glycoprotein \n  \nThe global initiative on sharing\nall influenza data (GISAID) has updated the SARS-CoV-2 genome and\nthe spike glycoprotein sequence based on data submitted by laboratories\nand research institutes around the world. As of February 2021, we\nhave downloaded more than 200\u202f000 protein sequences of the\nspike glycoproteins. After removing redundant and incomplete sequences,\nwe found that there are 98 unique spike glycoproteins, most of which\nhave mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike S1 ( ). The sequences\nare arranged according to their submission date (strain list is given\nin  ).  a illustrates the schematic structure of\nSARS-CoV-2 and its spike glycoprotein, and  b compares the alignment of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,\nand MERS-CoV. Genetic analysis showed 79% similarity between SARS-CoV\nand SARS-CoV-2, and the amino acid sequence identity was 76.47%;  the sequence alignment between MERS-CoV and\nSARS-CoV showed significant differences.  There were 51 amino acid changes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,\nor 25.8% variation. Importantly, the variation falls in several sites\nthat are critical for binding affinity to the host cell receptors.  From 12/2019 to 05/2020, amino acid mutations\nwere observed at 19.3% positions within the RBD domain ( c). This result indicates that\nthe diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is caused by its frequent mutation on\nthe spike RBD. Thus, it is essential to clarify the spike RBD domain\nvariation to provide necessary information for the development of\ninhibitors, antibodies, and vaccines. \n  \nAmino acid mutation predominantly occurred\non the receptor-binding\ndomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from 12/2019 to 05/2020.\n(a) Domains of SARS-CoV-2 virion include ORF1a&b, spike (S), 3a,\n3b, envelope (E), membrane (M), 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b, and nucleocapsid\n(N). The spike S1 domain consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD), a\nreceptor-binding domain (RBD), a subdomain 1 (SD1), and a SD2; the\nother domains are S2, heptad repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), connector\ndomain (CD), HR2, transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic tail (CT). S1/S2\nis the protease cleavage site, FP is the fusion peptide, and S2\u2032\nis the protease cleavage site. (b) Spike RBD sequence alignment between\nSARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. (c) Alignment on RBD of SARS-CoV-2\nstrains from 12/2019 to 05/2020. The 98 complete and unique sequences\nare listed, most of which are conserved. The amino acid mutations\nare highlighted with white bars, while few mutations are observed\nin other domains of spike glycoproteins. \n  \n\n### N-Glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 Regulated by the Expression System \n  \nThe purified recombinant S1 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells\n(HEK2) and baculovirus-insect cells (BIC2 and BIC1) ( ) were purchased from Sino Biological.\nThe analysis of each sample was performed in triplicate. Each N-glycosite\nwas plotted using relative abundance related to all N-glycosites. \n\nThe expression system impacts N-glycosylation and the types of N-glycans\nat each site. As shown in  a,b, the spike S1 expressed in HEK293 cells has 12\nN-glycosites. When expressed in baculovirus-insect cells, it will\ncarry an additional N-glycosite N603. N-glycans show distinct patterns\nbetween the proteins expressed by HEK2 and BIC2. For example, N17\nonly exhibits complex N-glycans in HEK2, and N17 in BIC2 predominantly\ncontains complex N-glycans with 4% high mannose. A similar observation\nwas also found in N149 of HEK2. On the other hand, HEK2 N616 only\nhas the Man5 (Man5GlcNAc2: Man = Mannose, GlcNAc = N-acetylglucosamine),\nwhile N616 from BIC2 mainly contains complex N-glycans, a small amount\nof hybrid and high-mannose N-glycans. These results indicate that\nthe N616 site from HEK2 cells can be accessed by \u03b11,2-mannosidases,\nbut not as much as GlcNAcT-I.  Other sites\ncontaining complex and high-mannose N-glycans, such as N61, N74, N331,\nand N343 in HEK2, or N74, N234, N282, and N331 in BIC2, are good substrates\nfor GlcNAcT-I when forming complex N-glycans. N122, N165, N234, N282,\nand N657 in HEK2 show hybrid N-glycans; N-61, N122, N149, N165, N603,\nN616, and N657 in BIC2 also have hybrid N-glycans, indicating that\nthe N-glycan process of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the expression system.\nMoreover, the sialylation distribution of N-glycans is strikingly\ndifferent between HEK2 and BIC2. Except for N616, all other N-glycosites\nin HEK2 contain large amounts of sialylated N-glycans. Further linkage\nanalysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-MS (MALDI-MS)\nshowed that these sialic acids have \u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6 linkage\n( d and  ),  suggesting\nthat these peptide substrates may be processed by sialyltransferases\n(e.g., ST3Gal4 or ST6Gal1). Our results are consistent with previous\nstudies on the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins recombinantly expressed on\nthe HEK293 supernatant,  except for the identification\nof N-glycans in N17 and N603 in our study, even though the number\nof N-glycans observed in these N-glycosites is limited. \n  \nSite-specific\ncharacterization of N-glycosylation of the S1 domain\nof SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. (a) SARS-CoV-2 virus\nexpressed in HEK293 cells. Twelve N-glycosites in S1 were identified\nby LC-MS/MS. N-glycans are divided into high-mannose (green), hybrid\n(light purple), and complex (purple). N-glycosites, N17 and N149,\nare attached by complex N-glycans, N616 only has high-mannose (Man5),\nand other sites are predominantly complex types. Among these sites,\nN165, N234, and N657 have more than 10% hybrid N-glycans. (b) SARS-CoV-2\nvirus expressed in baculovirus-insect. In addition to 12 N-glycosites\nsimilar to HEK293 cells, another N-glycosite N603 was detected. High-mannose\nand complex N-glycans are present in all N-glycosites, while hybrid\nN-glycans are present in N61, N122, N149, N165, N343, N616, N657,\nand N603. (c) SARS-CoV virus expressed in baculovirus-insect cells.\nThere are 14 N-glycosites in SARS-CoV. High-mannoses are predominantly\npresent in N65, N227, and N318. Complex N-glycans are highly abundant\nin N29, N73, N109, N118, N119, N158, N296, N330, N357, N589, and N602.\n(d) MALDI-MS profiling of N-glycans released from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.\nSpike S1 was immobilized on AminoLink plus resins and derivatized\nby ethyl esterification/ethylenediamine amidation. The most abundant\nN-glycans are represented, and complete N-glycans for HEK293, CoV-2,\nand CoV are listed in  . Data are\ngiven as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. \n  \nSARS-CoV expressed in baculovirus-insect (BIC1) has 14 N-glycosites,\nand SARS-CoV-2 expressed in baculovirus-insect (BIC2) has 13 N-glycosites.\nBIC1 and BIC2 produce high-mannose and complex N-glycans, and all\nof these N-glycans contain fucosylated complex types such as Man3GlcNAc2Fuc1,\nor known as paucimannose specific to the insect. These results demonstrate\nthe synthesis of core fucose in the presence of \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferase\nin the baculovirus-insect cells.  Conversely,\nalmost no sialylated N-glycans were identified in the BIC1 or BIC2,\nalthough treatment of baculovirus-insect with a \u03b2-  N  -acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor may produce terminally sialylated\nN-glycans.  N-glycosylation primarily\nglycosylated by high-mannoses is located at N61, N122, and N234 in\nBIC2 and N65, N227, and N318 in BIC1. The subtle difference in N-glycosylation\nmay be attributed to the change in the amino acid sequence between\nBIC2 and BIC1. Generally, the N-glycan profile is highly conserved\nbetween BIC2 and BIC1 ( d). \n\n\n### Differential Pattern of O-Glycosites of SARS-CoV-2\nin Host Cells \n  \n shows the\npotential O-glycosylation\non the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicted by ISOGlyP.  In this study, T or S sites marked as \u201chigh\u201d were\nreported in the literature and detected in our work, and our method\nalso detected other O-glycosites marked as \u201cmedium\u201d\n( ). It is worth noting that the\ndetected O-glycosites are mainly in the peptide substrate cluster,\ne.g., T22, T29, S31, and T33 are in the peptide cluster of T[22]QLPPAYT[29]NS[31]FT[33]R.\nThis is consistent with the finding that an amino acid substrate containing\nP (proline) is beneficial to GalNAcTs (UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide   N  -acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (E.C. E.C. 2.4.1.41))\naccessible to the T or S residues.  The charge\nstate surrounding T or S may be a factor because the polarity of the\nGalNAcTs lectin domain affects glycosylation. \n\nAccording to N-glycopeptide analysis, spike S1 also showed\ndifferent O-glycosylation expressed in HEK293 and baculovirus-insect\ncells. In the HEK293 cells, T323 and T325 are O-glycosylated by GalNAc\nand GalGalNAc mucin-type O-glycans. S637, T676, and T638 are more\nabundant than BIC2. In BIC2, T22, T29, S31, T33, S94, T95, T323, and\nT325 are the most abundant O-glycosites; T572 and T573 are only present\nin BIC2. These results may imply that the types of GalNAcTs are different\nin HEK2 and BIC2 because the glycopeptide substrate preferences of\nGalNAcTs may cause distinct O-glycosylation.  It is expected that for the same peptide substrates, such as S323,\nS325, T676, and T678, there will be some O-glycosites with similar\nglycosylation. A comparison of the site-specific O-glycan profiles\non these O-glycosites is given in  b\u2013e. We noticed that T323 has O-glycans\nsimilar to GalNAc (N1) and GalGalNAc (H1N1). The other three main\nO-glycosites have divergent O-glycans. For example, BIC2 has H1N1\nat S325, N1, H1N1, H2N1, and H3F1 (F = Fucose) at S673, H1, H1N1,\nH2N1, H1N2, H1N2F2, H3F1, H4N3F2, and H2N4F2 at T676; HEK2 has H1N1,\nH2N1, and N3F1 at S325, H1N1, H2N1, H3F1, H2N4F2, and S1H3N2F1 (S\n= NeuAc) at S673, H1N1, H2N1, H1N2, N3F1, H2N4F2, S1N2N3, and S1H3N2F1\nat T676. This demonstrates the combination of the availability of\nbranched glycoenzyme and the preference for GalNAcTs on peptide substrates. \n  \nDifferential O-glycosylation in spike S1 expressed in\nbaculovirus-insect\nand HEK293. (a) Relative abundance of O-glycosites identified in the\nSpike S1 domain. The most abundance O-glycosites are labeled in the\nring, and the complete list of all O-glycosites are described in the\nlegend. (b) Most abundant O-glycosite, T323, is present in both BIC2\nand HEK2. This O-glycosite consists of GalNAc (N1) and GalGalNAc (H1N1).\n(c) S325 in BIC2 is mainly H1N1, while S325 in HEK2 is more diverse.\nO-glycosites (d) S673 and (e) T676 reveal more diverse O-glycans in\nHEK2, including several sialylated species. \n  \n\n### O-Glycosylation in the BIC2 RBD Domain \n  \nThe location\nof the O-glycosites is different between HEK293 and baculovirus-insect\n( a). We paid\nspecial attention to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in two\ncell lines. RBD has 197 amino acids starting from I332 to K528. When\nSARS-CoV-2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, nine O-glyosites were found\nincluding S366, T371, T430, S438, S443, S477, T478, S494, and T500\n( ). GalNAc,\nGalGalNAc, and GalGalNAc2 are the main O-glycans in all O-glycosites,\nand the abundance of S494 and T500 is high (the area inside the circle\nin HEK293 represents the relative abundance). These two O-glycosites\nand T438 are the key positions that may affect the binding affinity\nof RDB to the ACE2 receptor. \n  \nSite-specific\nO-glycan profiling of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding\ndomain expressed in baculovirus-insect and HEK293 cells. The outer\nring, 16 O-glycosites within RBD of baculovirus-insect cells expressed\nSARS-CoV-2. Conversely, HEK293 cells expressing RBD have nine O-glycosites.\nThe area within the ring denotes the relative abundance of the O-glycosite,\nwhile the ring color illustrates the same O-glycosites between baculovirus-insect\nand HEK293, e.g., S371 in yellow for both BIC2 and HEK2. Baculovirus-insect\nhas fucosylated O-glycans in most O-glycosites, and HEK293 produces\nsialylated O-glycans in several O-glycosites, including T500. \n  \nCompared with HEK293 cells, the O-glycosylation\nof SARS-CoV-2 S1\nRBD domain expressed in Baculovirus-insect cells is more diverse and\ncomplex. Besides the nine O-glycosites identified in HEK2, six additional\nO-glycosites were found in BIC2, revealing that the density of O-glycosites\nis higher in BIC2. Additionally, no sialylated O-glycans were found\nin BIC2, while HEK2 showed sialic acid at S371, T430, S438, T478,\nS494, and T500. This is consistent with previous reports that insect\ncells lack sialyltransferases, rarely produce sialylated glycans,\nand often require metabolic engineering to make terminal sialic acid.  It is worth noting that terminal sialic acid plays an important\nrole in viral infection by attaching to the surface of host cells\n(such as influenza virus hemagglutinin or receptor determinants for\ncoronaviruses). \n\n\n### Potential Impact of Glycosite\nDifferentiation on the RBD\u2013ACE2\nBinding \n  \nWe further compared how RBD amino acid mutations\nchange RBD glycosylation ( ). Although the lengths of the RBD domains of SARS-CoV-2,\nSARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are different, they contain a receptor-binding\nmotif (RBM) in which 10 sites directly interact with the ACE2 receptor. a shows 10\nsites (red dotted circle) across their coronavirus strains. We emphasized\nwhether the amino acid inside, before or after each binding site is\nT or S (e.g., S438 before site 1 in SARS-CoV-2, T425 before site 1\nin SARS-CoV). The reason is that glycosylation changes at these sites\nmay impact the binding affinity between the spike S1 and ACE2.  b compares N- and\nO-glycosites of the spike S1 RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\nThe red bars indicate the relative abundance of N-glycosites, while\nthe cyan bars indicate O-glycosites (  note  : the purple\ndotted line is a value equal to 0). There is one N-glycosite located\nwithin the RBD domain in SARS-CoV-2 and two N-glycosites in SARS-CoV;\nhowever, these N-glycosites are not in the RBM domain. There are several\nO-glycosites highly abundant in SARS-CoV than that in CoV-2, such\nas S362, T363, T431, S432, and T433. These O-glycosites are in the\nsecondary structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD.  The O-glycosites at S438, S494, and T500 are ACE2 contact residues\nor adjacent to them ( c). The high abundance of these O-glycosites in SARS-CoV-2\nmay be the determinant of the attachment of spike S1 to ACE2. \n  \nO-glycosites\nin or nearby key ACE2\u2013RBD binding sites. (a)\nTen binding sites that are crucial in the ACE2\u2013RBM interaction.\nThese sites are aligned for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS. (b) N-\nand O-glycosites in the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\nThe red bar is the relative abundance of N-glycosites, and the cyan\nbar is that of O-glycosites. Each amino acid is aligned based on the\nsequence described in (a). (c) Three ACE2\u2013RBM binding sites\n(1, 7, and 9) overlapping with O-glycosites. SARS-CoV-2 has S438,\nS494, and T500; SARS-CoV has T485 and T486. The RBM, receptor-binding\nmotif, starts from S438 to Q506. \n  \nBased on PDB 6VW1 (dimer) for SARS-CoV-2 and PDB 3D0H for SARS-CoV, we mapped S1 glycosites\nusing receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with ACE2.  shows the\nsite-specific glycosylation mapping of SARS-CoV in baculovirus-insect\n(BIC1) (  a),\nSARS-CoV-2 in baculovirus-insect (BIC2) ( b), and SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293 cells (HEK2)\n( c). Compared\nwith BIC2, BIC1 has less glycosites on the spike S1. The latter has\nO-glycosite at T500 in the RBM domain and may affect the affinity\nof the spike S1 and ACE2. BIC1 retains complex N-glycans and GalGalNAc\nor Gal O-glycans; in contrast, BIC2 also carries complex O-glycans\nand a higher number of O-glycosites. HEK2 revealed a similar location\nof glycosylation but showed different high-mannose N-glycans at N343\nand fewer O-glycosites of spike S1. The spike S1 glycosylation in\nRBM and secondary structure may interact with ACE2 receptors, whose\nglycosylation adds another factor in S1 attachment and virus fusion\ninto host cells.  Further studies on the stoichiometric\nstructure of RBD and ACE2 can provide valuable insights into the interaction\nbetween RBD and ACE2. \n  \nMapping glycosites of the Spike S1 RBD domain and its\nhuman receptor\nACE2. N-glycosites are labeled in red and O-glycosites in cyan. The\nsite mapping color represents different types of glycans: yellow =\nGal (H1), GalGalNAc (H1N1) without or with minimal fucosylation or\nsialylation; light yellow = H1 or H1N1 with fucosylation or sialylation;\npink = fucosylation and/or sialylation; green = high-mannose; purple\n= sialylated complex N-glycans; light purple = other types of complex\nN-glycans. SARS-CoV is based on 3D0H  and\nSARS-CoV-2 on 6WV1.  (a) SARS-CoV Spike\nS1 RBD domain glycosites include T485, T486, and T487 near or within\nthe binding sites between ACE2 and RBD. These sites are H1 and H1N1.\nThe front and back sides of the S1 are illustrated for glycosites.\n(b) Glycosites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 RBD domain expressed in\nbaculovirus-insect cells. (c) Glycosites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1\nRBD domain expressed in HEK293 cells. \n  \n\n### Summary and Perspectives \n  \nIn this study, we investigated\nthe effect of host expression cells on the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2\nspike S1 protein. SARS-CoV-2 virus particles infect host cells through\nS1 attachment to cells and S2 fusion. The affinity between S1 and\nhost cell receptors plays a critical role in viral infection and transmission.\nThe receptor-binding domain of spike S1 has a specific receptor-binding\nmotif (RBM), which may directly interact with the receptor through\nhydrogen bonds and salt bridges.  From\nS438 to Q506, the RBM domain has 10 sites that directly interact with\nthe ACE2 receptor. The binding kinetics between RBM and ACE2 receptor\nmay be affected by glycosylation on these two proteins,  which has been similarly manifested by influenza\nA virus hemagglutinin  and HIV-1 whose\nencapsulated glycan moieties determine viral propagation.  The glycosylation of spike S depends on the\nhost cell line, which can express varying glycoenzymes and transporters,\nresulting in specificity and heterogeneity.  Differential glycosylation not only impacts the infectivity of the\nvirus but also changes the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic products.\nThus, we intend to explore how the expression system regulates the\nglycosylation of spike S1 RBM and secondary structure and compare\nthe glycosylation distribution between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. \n\nHEK293 and baculovirus-insect cell expression system is used for\nnon-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine development.  Our results\nshow that the expression cell determines glycosylation of the spike\nS1 and the type of attached glycans. SARS-CoV-2 derived from baculovirus-insect\ncells contains high-mannose and fucosylated complex N-glycans and\nfucosylated mucin-type O-glycans. SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293 cells constructs\nhybrid and sialylated complex N-glycans and sialylated O-glycans.\nMALDI-MS analysis found that SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293 contains \u03b12,3-\nand \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids. These observations are consistent\nwith the glycan biosynthesis of the expression system. The known glycan\nbiosynthetic pathways of insects can form Man3GlcNAc2Fuc through GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2\nwith \u03b1-mannosidase II, core \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferase, and\nN-Acetylglucosaminidase. Complex glycans are further extended by additional\nglycoenzymes.  HEK293 follows the general\nmammalian glycosylation pathways, forming biantennary, triantennary,\nor tetraantennary complex glycans in the presence of sialic acid or\nfucose residues.  As expected, we found\nthat SARS-CoV-2 expressed by HEK293 has bisected, fucosylated, and\nsialylated N-glycans and fucosylated/sialylated O-glycans. When using\nthe same expression host cell, similar glycosylation was still detected\nin BIC2 and BIC1 despite the different strains. \n\nGlycosite mapping\nof spike S1 suggests the potential influence\nof host cells on the binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. Eight\nO-glycosites in the RBM domain were identified in the baculovirus-insect\nand six O-glycosites in HEK293. The difference in glycosylation and\nthe three-dimensional (3D) conformation of spike S1 can improve the\ninteraction with the ACE2 receptor. It is very important to systematically\nstudy glycosylation, since the RBD (especially RBM) in the SARS-CoV-2\nspike glycoprotein may be the target for the development of virus\nattachment inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines.  Given that SARS-CoV-2 can be infected and transmitted\nthrough many media (lungs, oral, eyes, intestine, etc.), consideration\nshould be given to selecting suitable host cell lines for diagnostic\napplications and the development of inhibitors, antibodies, or vaccines. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Sample Preparation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 \n  \nRecombinant\nspike S1 was purchased from Sino Biological (HEK2, BIC2, and BIC1)\n( ). The amino\nacid sequences of HEK2 and BIC2 were from V16 to K685 and that of\nBIC1 from M1 to R667. The sample preparation followed the procedure\ndescribed in  . Each sample was\nperformed in technical triplicate. First, 40 \u03bcg of the protein\nwas denatured in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) water\nat 90 \u00b0C/10 min, and half of which was reduced in 12 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine\nhydrochloride (TCEP)/37 \u00b0C/1 h and alkylated in 16 mM iodoacetamide\n(IAA)/room temperature/1 h. The sample was then digested with trypsin\n(1:25) (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 \u00b0C/overnight. The digest\nsolution was acidified with 30 \u03bcL of 100% trifluoroacetic acid\n(TFA) prior to solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge C18 cleanup\n(Waters, Milford, MA). An in-house packed Amide-80 (Tosoh Bioscience\nLLC, King of Prussia, PA) HILIC SPE column was used to further enrich\nglycopeptides.  The glycopeptides and\nflow-through peptides after HILIC were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. \n\nThe remaining 20 \u03bcg of the protein after denaturation was conjugated\nwith an Aminolink plus coupling resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA) for glycan analysis. The solid-phase method is called glycoprotein\nimmobilization for glycan extraction (GIG),  in which \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid underwent an ethyl esterification\nreaction (0.5 M   N-  (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-  N  \u2032-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC\u00b7HCl)\nand 0.5 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HBot), 250 \u03bcL) and\n\u03b12,3-linked sialic acid through a carbodiimide coupling (1 M   p  -toluidine in the presence of EDC (pH 4\u20136)).  First, we used 1 \u03bcL of PNGase F (New England\nBioLabs, Ipswich, MA) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to release N-glycans;\nthe remaining sample on the Aminolink resin was further processed\nto release O-glycans through \u03b2-elimination (0.1 M NaOH) and\npermethylation. The permethylated O-glycans were purified using a\nC18 SPE cartridge and eluted with 300 \u03bcL of 60% ACN in 0.1%\nTFA. Glycans were analyzed by MALDI-time-of-flight/TOF-MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS)\n(Bruker Autoflex). \n\n\n### MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS Identification of Glycans \n  \nThe eluted\nglycans in 60% ACN (0.1% TFA) were spotted onto a \u03bcFocus MALDI\nplate (384 circles; Hudson Surface Technology, West New York, NJ),\ntogether with 1 \u03bcL of 10 mg/mL dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix\nin the presence of 2%   N  ,  N  -dimethylaniline\n(DMA) (50% ACN in 0.1 mM NaCl). The plate was dried on the top of\na 50\u201360 \u00b0C hot plate. Each MALDI-MS test was performed\nin triplicate for 8000 shots. The mass (  m  /  z  ) was searched against the glycan database in GlycoWorkBench.  For N-glycans, the mass range was set between\n900 and 6000 Da, while it was set between 300 and 3000 Da for O-glycans. \n\n\n### LC-MS/MS Analysis of Glycopeptides \n  \nThe samples were\nanalyzed using a Dionex U3000 nanoHPLC system connected to a Thermo\nOrbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nGlycopeptides (1 \u03bcg) were injected and desalted with an Acclaim\nPepMap C18 Nano trap column (3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm \u00d7\n2 cm) at 5 \u03bcL/min with 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC\nwater) for 5 min. Then, glycopeptides were separated by an Acclaim\nPepMap 100 nano column (3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm \u00d7\n250 mm) using a linear gradient of 2.5\u201337.5% solvent B (80%\nACN, 0.1% formic acid) over 85 min, with a wash at 90% B for 5 min.\nThe column was equilibrated at 2.5% B for 10 min before the next injection.\nData-dependent analysis (DDA) was carried out with a duty cycle of\n2 s. Precursor masses were detected in the orbitrap at a resolution\n(  R  ) of 120\u202f000 (at   m  /  z   200) with internal calibration (Easy IC). Stepped HCD\nspectra (HCD energy at 15, 25, and 35%) were acquired for precursors\nwith charges between 2 and 8 and intensities over 5.0 \u00d7 10  at   R   = 30\u202f000. Dynamic exclusion\nwas set at 20 s. When at least one glycan oxonium fragment ion (  m  /  z   138.0545, 204.0867, 366.1396 Da) was\nobserved within the top 20 most abundant fragments and within 15 ppm\nmass accuracy, an EThcD spectrum was acquired in the orbitrap at   R   = 30\u202f000. The electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)\nreagent target was 2.0 \u00d7 10 , with supplemental collision\nenergy at 15%. The ETD reaction time was dependent on the precursor\ncharge state: 125 ms (ETD reaction time) for charge 2, 100 ms for\n3, 75 ms for 4, and 50 ms for \u22655. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nThrough precursor and MS/MS fragmentation\nmatching, the glycan composition analysis was performed in GlycoWorkBench,\nwhich uses glycan databases from a consortium for functional glycomics\n(CFG), Carbbank, GlycomeDB, and Glycosciences. The derivatization\nof the sialic acid linkages added a mass tag to its residues, namely,\n28.031301 on \u03b12,6-link or 42.058183 on \u03b12,3-link. The\nidentified N-glycans and O-glycans were used as the glycan database\nfor glycopeptide analysis ( ). \n\nMS/MS spectra were searched using Byos (Protein Metrics,\nSan Carlos, CA) against a spiked protein database compiled in-house.\nThe identified glycans in the MALDI-TOF were used as the glycan database.\nSearch parameters include precursor mass tolerance (15 ppm), HCD fragment\nmass tolerance (20 ppm), EThcD fragment mass tolerance (20 ppm), missed\ncleavage (3), oxidation (+15.994915, variable), carbamidomethyl (+57.021464,\nfixed), common modification (\u22642), rare modification (1), maximum\nprecursor mass (30\u202f000), protein FDR (2%), and missed cleavage\n(3). The identified glycopeptides were manually verified according\nto oxonium ions, pep-HexNAc, and y and b ions with fragments surrounding\nan O-glycosite. An example of glycopeptide tandem MS is shown in  . For a peptide that has multiple glycosites,\nsuch as N-glycosite and T/S O-glycosites, we use a fragment ion calculator\n( ) to check the fragmentation mass of glycopeptides. \n\nThe quantification\nof glycopeptides was performed as follows. After\nsearching the LC-MS/MS spectra against Byonic, Byologic further analyzed\nthe Byonic output files. The total area under the curve (AUC) of each\nglycopeptide was extracted from LC-MS/MS by Byologics. The AUC of\nthe same glycopeptide was summed up, and the relative abundance was\nestimated by dividing the AUC (single glycopeptide) by the total AUC\n(all glycopeptides). To quantify glycans on each glycosite, we used\nthe AUC of each glycoform divided by the total AUC of all glycoforms. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8204757, "text_md5": "369c3c94339bcb8e9b0beed3b2745fad", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 71], "journal": [72, 81], "publication_year": [83, 87], "title": [98, 189], "keywords": [203, 203], "abstract": [216, 1434], "body": [1443, 35467]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34179644, "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.1c01785", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204757", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8204757"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204757\">8204757</a>", "list_title": "PMC8204757  Impact of Expressing Cells on Glycosylation and Glycan\nof the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein"}

Our study aimed to clinically and genetically characterize macular dystrophy in a family (MOL1154) consisting of six affected subjects with a highly variable maculopathy phenotype in which no correlation between age and severity exists. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nClinical characterization included visual acuity testing and electroretinography. Genetic analysis included Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWES analysis performed on DNA samples from two individuals revealed a heterozygous deletion of six nucleotides [c.2247_2252del; p.(Leu750_Lys751del)] in the   CFH   gene. Co-segregation analysis revealed that five of the six NCMD affected subjects carried this deletion, while one individual who had a relatively mild phenotype compatible with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) did not carry it. We subsequently analyzed the upstream region of   PRDM13   that has previously been reported to be associated with NCMD and identified a unique heterozygous transversion (chr6:100040974A>C) located within the previously described suspected control region in all six affected individuals. This transversion is likely to cause NCMD. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nNCMD has a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that can overlap with AMD, making it challenging to correctly diagnose affected individuals and family members. The DNA sequence variant we found in the   CFH   gene of some of the affected family members may suggest some role as a modifier gene. However, this variant still does not explain the huge phenotypic variability of NCMD and needs to be studied in other and larger populations. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInherited macular diseases include a wide range of complex entities characterized by bilateral visual loss with significant macular abnormalities and belong to a larger group of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). In many cases, the disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity is evident in IRDs, and various inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), and X-linked (XL) patterns, have been reported. \n\nNorth Carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD; OMIM  ) is a unique congenital macular dystrophy with an AD inheritance pattern [ ]. Originally, NCMD was reported in a single family living in the mountains of North Carolina, and therefore the disease was named after the founder effect of this family [ , ]. NCMD is a non-progressive disorder characterized by a variable macular phenotype with a few small (less than 50\u00a0\u00b5m) yellow drusen-like lesions in the macular center in grade I, larger confluent lesions in grade II, and macular colobomatous lesions in grade III [ ]. \n\nThe original NCMD family disease was mapped by Small et al. [ ] using genetic linkage analysis of chromosome 6q16 and was named MCDR1 (MC = macula, D = dystrophy, R = retina 1 = first one mapped) by the Human Genome Organization. Subsequently, multiple new NCMD families worldwide were found to be mapped to chromosome 6q16 [ - ]. Subsequently, the NCMD phenotype in a Danish family was mapped to chromosome 5 (MCDR3, MIM:608850) [ - ]. Using whole-genome sequencing, Small et al. found four rare mutations in a non-coding region of the MCDR1 locus [ ]. Three were single base substitutions in a DNASE1 hypersensitivity site between CCNC and PRDM13. A large family from Belize was found to have a large duplication involving PRDM13 and the DNASE1 site. The Danish MCDR3 family was found to have a large duplication involving IRX1 and another DNASE1 site. This was the first study that provided strong evidence of the role of PRDM13 dysregulation in NCMD pathogenesis [ ]. These observations were further supported by the identification of a different tandem duplication of   PRDM13   as the cause of NCMD [ ]. By studying additional MCDR3-linked families, two distinct heterozygous tandem duplications at the MCDR3 locus, including the   IRX1   and   ADAMTS16   genes, were reported [ ]. It should be noted that several macular dystrophies have common clinical and histopathological features similar to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [ ]. The clinical findings of NCMD grade 1 can be indistinguishable from those of AMD, particularly if the subject is elderly. \n\nHere, we present the clinical and genetic characterization of a family with AD maculopathy with marked clinical variability. Two variants, one in the   PRMD13   suspected control region and the other in   CFH  , were variably found in this small family with this disease. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Clinical characterization \n  \nThe study was approved by the Hadassah medical center Institutional Review Board (IRB) and was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects provided their written consent after receiving an explanation of the purpose of the study. Eight members of a family with macular dystrophy (MOL1154) underwent a comprehensive ocular examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) testing, electroretinography (ERG), electrooculography (EOG), color vision testing using the Farnsworth D-15 panel and Ishihara tests, perimetry using the SITA-fast strategy (white target III), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), short-wave fundus autofluorescence (SWAF) imaging, and fluorescein angiography (FA) [ ]. \n\n\n### Genetic analysis \n  \nBlood samples were collected from each participant, and genomic DNA was isolated using a Maxwell\u00ae 16 Blood DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the genomic DNA samples of the index case (MOL1154 IV:2) and her father (MOL1154 III:2) using exomic libraries prepared using a Nextera Rapid Capture Expanded Exome Kit on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The raw sequence data files were evaluated and aligned to the human reference sequence (hg19, GRCH37) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), variants were identified using the GATK pipeline, and the annotation of variants was done using ANNOVAR software. The following filtering steps were implemented: (1) Only heterozygous variants that were present in the index case and absent in the unaffected father were included. (2) Missense, nonsense, frameshift indels, inframe indels, and canonical splice-site variants were included; synonymous variants were excluded. (3) Variants with minor allele frequency > 0.005 were excluded (4). In addition, online prediction tools (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 ( ); Sorting intolerant from tolerant ( ), and  ) were used to prioritize missense variants. \n\nSanger sequencing of the entire exonic (and immediate intronic) region of   CFH   and the previously described suspected control region of   PRDM13   was performed on the DNA sample of the index case. PCR primers to amplify and sequence the   CFH   exons were designed using Primer3 Plus software. Primers for the suspected control region of   PRDM13   were reported previously [ ] (Appendix 1). The amplified PCR products were analyzed by Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of identified variants. In addition, PCR analysis of the reported copy number variation of the MCDR1 locus was performed as previously described [ ]. \n\n\n### Multiple sequence alignment and structural modeling \n  \n#### Generation of multiple sequence alignments \n  \nHomologous sequences were obtained from  . Sequence conservation was determined based on the multiple sequence alignment. \n\n\n\n### Generation of structural models of the CFH deletion mutant and estimation of the effect on structural organization and stability \n  \nThe Rosetta Macromolecular Modeling suite [ ] was used to generate models of the deletion mutant and for the structure-based estimation of the effects on protein stability. Modeling the deletion involved three steps (see Appendix 1 for more details). First, clashes in the structures were removed by a minimization constrained to the starting structure to prevent large moves. Second, kinematic loop closure [ ] was used to remodel the linker region of both the wild type (wt) and the deletion mutant (in which the linker loop was shortened by the two CFH residues L750 and K751). For each of the 20 minimized structures (one for each nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] model), 20 loop closure attempts were made, and the top-scoring model was chosen. Finally, the models were minimized to adjust the relative orientation of the two domains. The energies of the lowest-scoring structures for the wt and the deletion mutant were compared to estimate the loss in stability. The effect of point mutations was estimated using the Rosetta ddG monomer application [ ]. Visual inspection and the generation of figures of structures were performed using  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nMOL1154 is a Georgian Jewish family consisting of six affected subjects from four generations ( ) who underwent comprehensive ocular examinations. Five of the subjects were diagnosed with NCMD and one with AMD. The index case (MOL1154 IV:2) was a female who was 7 years old (YO) when referred to our retina clinic due to suboptimal visual acuity identified in a school screening test. On examination, BCVA was measured as 0.70 Snellen in both eyes (BE). The anterior segments were unremarkable, and there were yellowish macular lesions surrounded by refractile drusen-like dots and RPE atrophy ( ). A perimetry test showed generalized visual field depression and a central scotoma involving the fixation point in the left eye (LE) but not in the right eye (RE). Ancillary Ishihara and Farnsworth D-15 tests showed normal color vision; a full field electroretinography (ffERG) test showed normal rod and cone responses; and an electrooculography (EOG) test showed normal RPE function. Two years later, the BCVA was 0.80 Snellen in BE with no change in ocular findings. Horizontal cross-sectional spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images showed preservation of the ellipsoid zone and thickening of the inter-digitation layer in addition to RPE atrophy corresponding to the yellowish macular lesion borders. Microperimetry showed relatively unstable fixation compatible with the index case\u2019s maculopathy. Her 34 YO mother (MOL1154 III:1) started to complain of blurred vision at the age of 25. BCVA was 1.0 and 1.25 Snellen in the RE and LE, respectively. An ocular examination showed unremarkable anterior segments. SD-OCT showed overall preservation of the retinal layers except for subtle inter-digitation layer irregularity compatible with the drusen-like deposits ( ), and small drusen-like lesions engirdling the fovea were evident in BE ( ), resulting in a hyper autofluorescence dot-like pattern surrounding the fovea fixation test results in this case were within the low range of stable fixation. The 28 YO aunt (MOL1154 III:3), who had an unremarkable medical history, presented with asymmetric findings in BE, including BCVA of 0.10 and 1.0 in the RE and the LE, respectively. The anterior segments were within normal limits, but fundoscopy showed a diffuse atrophic retina with pigmentary dots and patches involving the macula (RE) and a yolk-like lesion surrounded by atrophic retina temporal to the fovea (LE). OCT scans were not available for this subject. The 64 YO grandmother (MOL1154 II:2) had a previous systemic history of hypertension, an ocular history of anisometropia, and RE amblyopia. BCVA was 0.30 Snellen in the RE and 0.80 Snellen in the LE. Fundoscopy revealed confluent yellowish spots involving the macula and the periphery combined with RPE atrophy, which appear as hyper-fluorescent lesions in short-wave autofluorescence photos, These were reflected by SD-OCT as a disruption of the inter-digitation layer combined with subfoveal pseudodrusens mainly in the RE (  and  ). The oldest subject was the 87 YO great grandmother (MOL1154 I:2) who had a previous medical history of atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin anticoagulation therapy. On examination, BCVA was 0.20 and 0.60 (RE and LE, respectively); BE were observed to have pseudophakia and macular and peripheral drusens compatible with dry AMD. Of note, all affected subjects presented variable phenotype expressivity with no correlation between age and disease severity other than phenotype anticipation. In the younger patients (MOL1154 IV:2 and III:3), severe atrophic scarring was observed, whereas in older patients (MOL1154 III:1, II:4, and II:2), macular atrophic changes were mild and late onset. In addition, significant asymmetry was observed between the two eyes in terms of both BCVA and fundoscopic findings in three of the five affected subjects ( ). Macular lesions were congruent with NCMD. \n  \nPedigree of the MOL1154 family. Filled symbols designate affected individuals.

MOL1154 III:1- OCT cross-sections show normal retinal structure. Note that drusen-like deposits were seen clinically but do not appear in the OCT sections. MOL1154 IV:2 - subfoveal RPE atrophy combined with thickening of the interdigitation layer, while the ellipsoid layer seems to be intact. \n    \nRetinal imaging by fundoscopy of affected members. Representative color fundus photos of five affected individuals are shown. Individual numbers and the age in years are shown on the left. MOL1154 III:1, II:4, and II:2 - confluent foveal drusen-like clusters, while no significant findings are evident in the periphery. MOL1154 III:3 - advanced macular atrophy in both eyes with pigmentary dots and patches in RE and a yolk-like lesion surrounded by atrophic retina temporal to the fovea in LE. MOL1154 IV:2 - refractile drusen-like dots surrounding macular atrophy containing yellowish deposits. OD (oculus dextrus) - right eye; OS (oculus sinister) - left eye. \n  \nTo identify the disease-causing mutation, we performed WES on the DNA samples of the index case and her unaffected father. The analysis revealed 19,003 variants in the index case (MOL1154 IV:2) and 22,062 variants in her father (MOL1154 III:2), with an average coverage of 48 reads per nucleotide. Among all variants, 3211 were prioritized based on an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (heterozygous variants that are present in the index case and absent in her unaffected father). Following filtering steps as detailed in the Methods section, we were able to reduce the list of candidate variants to 25 (Appendix 1) and then to 8, 5 of which were predicted to be deleterious by online prediction tools (PolyPhen 2, SIFT, and MutationTaster; Appendix 1). Finally, the possible sequence variants in genes that were previously reported to be associated with IRDs were studied, and a heterozygous variant, c.2247_2252del; p.(Leu750_Lys751del) that is absent from the gnomAD database was identified in exon 15 of the complement factor H   (CFH  ) gene ( ). This variant was present in five of the six affected subjects (MOL1154 I:2, who had a relatively mild phenotype that is compatible with AMD, did not carry it). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the two deleted amino acids are highly conserved among species ( ). Structural inspection of the NMR solved structure of the tandem CPP12\u201313 repeat (pdb ID 2KMS [ ]) revealed that the deletion is located in the connecting linker (residues 746\u2013751 AIDKLK); L750 is positioned at the center of a small hydrophobic core formed by residues in CPP12 (T724, I726) and the linker (V745, I747, K749, L750), which stabilizes the relative orientation between CPP12 and CPP13 ( ). To estimate the effect of the L750-K751 deletion on protein structure and stability, we modeled the structure of the mutant protein and compared it to the corresponding structure of the wt protein using a procedure of three consecutive steps (see Methods and Appendix 1 for more details). After the removal of clashes, the linker (residues  AIDKLKK  in the wt and residues  AIDKK  in the deletion mutant) was rebuilt followed by minimization that allowed the relative orientation of the two domains to adjust. The structural models of the wt and mutant proteins reveal how the hydrophobic patch centered around L750 is destabilized upon its removal. In the mutant, the shortened linker positions D748 at the same site, thereby changing the hydrophobic side chain character to a negative charge, which significantly destabilizes the structure (\u0394\u0394G  = -15.73 Rosetta energy units [REU];  ). \n  \nIdentified genetic variants.   A  : Domains of the CFH protein that is composed of 20 repetitive units of 60 amino acids called short consensus repeats (SCRs) or complement control protein modules (CCPs). The amino acid sequence of CCPs 12 (blue color) and 13 (red color) are depicted (690\u2013804). The eight residues that are in the black box are located in the CCP 12 and 13 linker region. The pink colored box shows amino acid residues that were found to be deleted in our study.   B  : Chromatograms of a homozygous wild type (top) and a heterozygous affected individual (bottom) with the c.2247_2252del; p.(Leu750_Lys751del)   CFH   variant. Arrows represent the beginning and the end of the six deletion nucleotides.   C  : Illustration of reported variants in chromosome 6: chr6:100020205\u2013100143306 duplication, 100,040,906 G>T, 100,040,987 G>C, and 100,041,040 C>T. The red arrow represents the location of the variant identified in the current study within the previously reported hotspot region- a DNase hypersensitivity site (blue), upstream of   PRDM13   gene (green). Genomic localization is based on human reference sequence hg19 (GRCH37).   D  : Chromatograms of a homozygous wild-type (top) and a heterozygous affected individual (bottom) with the chr6: 100040974A>C variant. \n    \nPartial amino acid sequence alignment of the CFH protein. The red box represents the amino acids that were found to be deleted in the present study. Red dots denote the amino acids that are highly conserved among species. Different species (human - NP 000,177.2; chimpanzee - XP 001,136,531.1; Rhesus monkey - XP 001,111,875.1; dog - XP 536,110.2; cattle - NP 001,029,108.1; house mice - NP 034,018.2; and Norway rats - NP 569,093.2) were used to check the conserved amino acids. \n    \nStructure-based analysis of the effect of the L750-K751 deletion. CPP12, linker, and CPP13 colored in green, purple and cyan, respectively. The structure is shown in cartoon, with the linker side chain shown in sticks; residues in the two CPP domains that participate in the formation of the hydrophobic patch are shown in spheres.   A  : Structural model of wt after loop remodeling, highlighting the central position of L750.   B  : Corresponding model of the deletion mutant: in the shortened loop, D748 replaces L750, perturbing the hydrophobic character of this region and leading to destabilization.   C, D  : Different relative orientations adapted by the CPP domains in wt (  C  ) and deletion mutant (  D  ) indicate increased variability in orientation for the deletion mutant compared to the wt. \n  \nTo estimate the contribution of the L750 side chain to stability, we performed computational point mutations of L750 to alanine (reflecting the removal of the L750 side chain) and aspartate (reflecting the local environment predicted for the mutant). The calculated changes in binding energy show similar results, indicating that indeed the interaction of the L750 side chain with the local hydrophobic patch is the main contribution of this residue to stability compared to the corresponding D748 side chain (\u0394\u0394G  = -7.31REU; \u0394\u0394G  = -17.26REU). Destabilization of this hydrophobic patch could well lead to changes in the relative orientation of the two domains. While the solved NMR structural models show some variation in orientation, this variation increases in the deletion mutant ( ). \n\nA report by Small et al. regarding the involvement of   PRDM13   in macular development [ ] concentrated our focus on the role of   PRDM13   in the MOL1154 family. Therefore, we screened genomic areas reported to include mutations in the vicinity of   PRDM13   and identified a novel heterozygous transversion (hg19; chr6: 100040974A > C) located within the previously described suspected control region. This variant segregated in the six affected individuals and was found in one questionably unaffected child (IV:3) and could not be found in 1000 Genomes and gnomAD. In addition, we screened 21 index cases that suffer from maculopathy (age range 15\u201365, 52% males, 75% sporadic and 25% AD, most pre-screened for IRD founder mutations in the appropriate population) and did not identify any possible   PRDM13-  related pathogenic variants. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study investigated a four-generation macular dystrophy family that has phenotypic variability consistent with NCMD. The oldest affected subject, I:2, has clinical findings suggestive of AMD and a phenocopy. \n\nOur initial WES analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion of six nucleotides (c.2247_2252del) in   CFH  . This variant, which would be expected to contribute to the AMD phenotype, was not present in the oldest affected subject, I:2. Another hypothesis is that the   CHF   variant may be acting as a modifier gene on   PRDM13  . \n\nCFH is a 155\u00a0kDa protein that is an abundant plasma glycoprotein [ - ] composed of 20 repetitive units. Each repetitive unit contains short consensus repeats (SCRs) or complement control protein modules (CCPs) that span approximately 60 residues (51\u201362 residues) [ ] ( ).   CFH   consists of 23 exons, where each repetitive unit is usually encoded by a single exon. Exon 1 encodes 18 amino acids at the N-terminal end for signal peptide formation; exons 3 and 4 together encode a single CCP; exon 10 does not participate in the synthesis of the   CFH   transcript but compensates in alternative transcript formation that encodes for factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) [ ]. To understand the effect of the identified p.(Leu750_Lys751del) variant on protein function, we inspected the NMR solution structure of CCPs 12 and 13 that span the deletion in the linker between the two CCP domains (2KMS [ ];  ). It has previously been reported that this central part of the repeat region in CFH (CCPs 12\u201314) forms a kink that allows the two ends (CCPs 1\u20136 and CCPs 19\u201320) to come together [ ]. Indeed, the multiple sequence alignment indicates that the deleted amino acids (Leu750 and Lys751) are part of a highly conserved region among different species ( ), which also includes residues Thr724, Ile726, Val745, Ala746, Ile747, Leu750, His773, and Asn794 that have been previously reported as key interface residues of CCPs 12 and 13 [ ]. The structure therefore suggests that the defined orientation between the two domains will be disrupted by removing L750. Structural models of the deletion mutant reveal that upon removal of L750-K751, the D748 side chain is positioned at the corresponding L750 site in the wt structure, thereby strongly destabilizing this hydrophobic patch. This could lead to extensive rearrangements ( ). In silico mutagenesis indicates that the side chain at position 750 mainly contributes to this destabilization. This destabilization can also lead to changes in the relative orientation of the two CCP domains ( ). Therefore, we predict that the identified variation can change the protein structure and may lead to functional consequences that can be a clue regarding the disease occurrence in this family. \n\nThe two most common variants in   CFH  , c.1204C > T (rs1061170, p.Tyr402His) [ ] and the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism rs1410996 [ ], explain 17% of AMD liability. In addition, according to a previous report, p.Arg1210Cys that occurs in CCPs 19\u201320 and that is predicted to cause loss of function of CFH, similar to our mutation, is likely to drive AMD risk to an earlier onset age of 6 years [ ]. This mutation has been associated with extensive macular drusen accumulation and advanced AMD [ ]. In addition, AMD patients were found to have a relatively large number of rare variants in CFH in both functional domains, CCPs1\u20134 and CCPs 19\u201320 [ ].These findings can explain the retinal findings in MOL1154 family members, including confluent drusen, RPE atrophy, and macular atrophy, which constitute typical fundoscopic findings in AMD patients. \n\nThe clinical features of the affected individuals of the MOL1154 family are similar to those of previously reported NCMD families [ ]. MOL1154 III:1, II:4, and II:2 showed confluent drusen-like clusters within the fovea compatible with grade II NCMD. MOL1154 IV:2 and III:3 presented with macular atrophy compatible with grade III. Following recent reports showing that NCMD can be caused by dysregulation of the retinal transcription factor   PRDM13  , we screened   PRDM13   and its suspected control region for mutations and identified a novel heterozygous transversion (chr6: 100040974A>C). As this variant is located within the previously described suspected control region, we suspect it could be the cause of disease, as supported by the segregation analysis. If we consider 87 YO subject II:1 to have NCMD rather than AMD, then the   PRDM13   segregates in all the affected subjects. \n\nPRDM13 plays a key role in controlling gene expression during development [ , ]. Macular formation is led by differential expression of genes and interaction between transcription factors (such as PRDM13), and the identification of their target genes will contribute to our understanding of this complex process [ ]. Any malfunction in this process can lead to macular dysregulation, which causes maculopathy. Variants have also been reported in   CCNC   and   IRX1   in NCMD families, but the role of   IRX1   was not clear with respect to disease pathogenesis [ ]. Subsequent studies by Bowne et al. supported the dysregulation of   PRDM13   as the cause of NCMD but not dysregulation of the   CCNC   gene [ ]. However, the identification of duplications involving a DNASE1 site near but not involving   IRX1   in the MCDR3 locus in NCMD families suggests that   IRX1   may be a causal target in such cases [ ]. \n\nIn conclusion, NCMD shares important clinical and histopathological features with AMD [ ], and therefore finding two different genomic variants in two different unlinked genes may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Because this family represents a rare and likely genetic isolate and because the family is small, it is difficult to be certain of any definitive causality of these findings. The   PRDM13   variant does seem to segregate in all the affected family members if the elderly subject I:2 is considered to be affected with NCMD and not AMD. This variant in the DNASE1 site upstream of   PRDM13   could be a private mutation and a new mutation causing NCMD. Larger families will need to be studied to determine the significance of these variants, particularly the   CFH   variant. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7245606, "text_md5": "15f846fe7be89d7b6b20b6b5bb67f65e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 192], "journal": [193, 200], "publication_year": [202, 206], "title": [217, 380], "keywords": [394, 394], "abstract": [407, 2220], "body": [2229, 28399]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32476814, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245606", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7245606"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245606\">7245606</a>", "list_title": "PMC7245606  A unique PRDM13-associated variant in a Georgian Jewish family with probable North Carolina macular dystrophy and the possible contribution of a unique CFH variant"}

Variants in   SPTLC1   are a known cause of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type 1A, and these data extend the phenotype associated with this gene. \n\n\n## Meaning \n  \nDe novo variants in the   SPTLC1   gene are associated with juvenile ALS, a fatal neurological disorder. \n\n  \nThis genetic association study identifies genetic variants associated with juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. \n  \n## Importance \n  \nJuvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare form of ALS characterized by age of symptom onset less than 25 years and a variable presentation. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nTo identify the genetic variants associated with juvenile ALS. \n\n\n## Design, Setting, and Participants \n  \nIn this multicenter family-based genetic study, trio whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the disease-associated gene in a case series of unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and severe growth retardation. The patients and their family members were enrolled at academic hospitals and a government research facility between March 1, 2016, and March 13, 2020, and were observed until October 1, 2020. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed in a series of patients with juvenile ALS. A total of 66 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS participated in the study. Patients were selected for the study based on their diagnosis, and all eligible participants were enrolled in the study. None of the participants had a family history of neurological disorders, suggesting de novo variants as the underlying genetic mechanism. \n\n\n## Main Outcomes and Measures \n  \nDe novo variants present only in the index case and not in unaffected family members. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTrio whole-exome sequencing was performed in 3 patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and their parents. An additional 63 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS were subsequently screened for variants in the   SPTLC1   gene. De novo variants in   SPTLC1   (p.Ala20Ser in 2 patients and p.Ser331Tyr in 1 patient) were identified in 3 unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and failure to thrive. A fourth variant (p.Leu39del) was identified in a patient with juvenile ALS where parental DNA was unavailable. Variants in this gene have been previously shown to be associated with autosomal-dominant hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type 1A, by disrupting an essential enzyme complex in the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. \n\n\n## Conclusions and Relevance \n  \nThese data broaden the phenotype associated with   SPTLC1   and suggest that patients presenting with juvenile ALS should be screened for variants in this gene. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relatively common neurological disorder characterized by progressive paralysis and death from respiratory failure. The vast majority of cases occur in individuals older than 40 years.  In contrast, juvenile ALS (defined as an age of onset less than 25 years) is a rare form of motor neuron disease.  These early-onset cases are characterized by slow progression and a variable phenotype that often makes accurate diagnosis challenging. \n\nConsiderable progress has been made in unravelling the genetic architecture underlying ALS, but much remains to be understood about this condition.  Juvenile ALS is thought to be more frequently genetic in origin than the adult-onset forms, and the genetic analysis of these young-onset cases offers an opportunity to identify disease-causing genes.  By extension, any gene underlying juvenile ALS may also play a role in adult-onset ALS. \n\nDe novo genetic variants may underlie at least a portion of ALS cases. Such variants would not be detected by genome-wide association studies owing to their recent occurrence and corresponding low frequency within the community. Spontaneously occurring variants are a well-known cause of neurological conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Indeed, de novo variants of the familial ALS genes   FUS  ,   SOD1  , and   VCP   have been described in sporadic ALS cases.  Such variants are more likely to present with early-onset disorders because of their impact on fitness. \n\nHere, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 3 patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and their unaffected parents to identify the variants associated with their disease. None of these patients had a family history of neuromuscular disorders, suggesting de novo variations as the underlying genetic mechanism. After identifying variants in serine palmitoyltransferase, long-chain base subunit 1 (  SPTLC1  ; OMIM,  ) in all 3 cases, we also screened patients with juvenile ALS from Turkey for   SPTLC1   variants and identified a fourth patient carrying an   SPTLC1   variant. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Patients \n  \nFour unrelated patients with neuromuscular symptoms consistent with juvenile ALS participated in the study between March 2016 and January 2021. The   summarizes the clinical features of the 4 patients. Detailed descriptions of each patient and their recruitment are available in the eMethods in the  . All participants provided written informed consent for genetic analysis according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health approved the study. Members of the FALS Sequencing Consortium, American Genome Center, International ALS Genomics Consortium, and ITALSGEN Consortium can be found in the eAppendix of the  . \n   Clinical Features of Patients Diagnosed With Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Carrying Variants in   SPTLC1     \nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; NA, not applicable. \n  \nPatient 1 presented with gradually progressive spastic diplegia and growth retardation beginning at age 5 years. By age 20 years, she had quadriplegia with marked muscle atrophy and diminished weight, brisk lower limb reflexes, tongue fasciculations and weakness, dysarthria, mild cognitive dysfunction, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and ventilation. Repeated neurophysiological testing did not show evidence of sensory or autonomic dysfunction. She was diagnosed with juvenile ALS based on the revised El Escorial criteria. \n\nPatient 2 was a teenaged girl of African American and White race who presented with a 6-year history of gradually progressive generalized limb and bulbar weakness. She had a long-standing history of progressive weight loss of unknown cause, and her school performance began to decline in her mid-teens. Her neurological examination at presentation revealed a body mass index less than the first percentile, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, tongue fasciculations and wasting, generalized muscle atrophy and weakness, brisk asymmetric ankle reflexes, a positive Gower sign, and normal sensation ( A and B). Neurophysiological testing revealed active and chronic denervation without evidence of sensory neuropathy. Decreased sustained attention and impaired executive functioning were evident in neuropsychological evaluation. She was diagnosed with juvenile ALS based on the revised El Escorial criteria. \n   Clinical Features of Patients Diagnosed With Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  \nA and B, Tongue wasting and scapular winging in patient 2 carrying the p.Ala20Ser   SPTLC1   variant. C and D, Tongue wasting and muscle atrophy of the lower limbs in patient 3 carrying the p.Ser331Tyr   SPTLC1   variant. Note the hammertoe deformities of both feet. \n  \nPatient 3 was an 11-year-old African American girl with a history of failure to gain weight and toe walking since age 4 years. She presented at age 10 years with a deteriorating gait, hand weakness, right foot paresthesia, dysphagia, and increased sweating. Examination revealed marked atrophy, postural tachycardia, bilateral cataracts, a wasted and fasciculating tongue with an exaggerated jaw jerk, generalized fasciculations and weakness associated with hyperreflexia, and decreased pinprick sensation in a glove-and-stocking distribution ( C and D). The patient walked abnormally owing to weakness and bilateral foot drop, and she had a positive Gower sign. Neurophysiological examination showed sensorimotor axonal neuropathy as well as polyphasic potentials on electromyography. She was diagnosed with juvenile ALS-Plus syndrome owing to her prominent motor symptoms and modest sensory-autonomic involvement. The pedigrees of patients 1, 2, and 3 are shown in  A to C. \n   De Novo Variants of   SPTLC1   in Patients Diagnosed With Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  \nA-D, Pedigrees of 4 patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS. The variant alleles in   SPTLC1   are indicated by vt, and wild-type alleles are indicated by wt. The arrowheads indicate the probands. E, Distribution of   SPTLC1   variants detected in patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS. Variants identified in the 3 patients with juvenile ALS are noted in red, and variants previously described to cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type 1A, are shown in green. \n  \nPatient 4 was a 34-year-old Turkish woman with a history of arm and leg weakness and atrophy since age 15 years. There was no family history of neuromuscular disease, and none of her 5 siblings had symptoms ( D). She was diagnosed with juvenile ALS, and she has been taking riluzole since age 15 years. Her symptoms were slowly progressive, and there were no upper motor neuron signs on examination. During her last review at age 34 years, she used a wheelchair, although she could walk short distances with assistance. She had no dysphagia and did not require oxygen supplementation, and her weight was normal. Neurophysiological examination at that time revealed denervation activity in all muscles and no evidence of multifocal motor neuropathy. \n\nFor variant screening of   SPTLC1   in adult-onset ALS, we used 6258 DNA samples obtained from individuals diagnosed with adult-onset ALS (eTable 1 in the  ). Control data consisted of 5710 neurologically healthy US individuals who had undergone next-generation sequencing at the Laboratory of Neurogenetics of the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, or the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project. \n\n\n### Next-Generation Sequencing in Juvenile ALS \n  \nWhole-exome sequencing was performed using 100 base-pair, paired-end sequencing on an Illumina sequencer (eg, HiSeq 2000) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. DNA from patient 1 and her family was sequenced in the Laboratory of Neurogenetics using TruSeq library preparation version 1.0. DNA from patients 2 and 3 and their families was sequenced at GeneDx using IDT xGen Exome Research Panel version 1.0. \n\nData were analyzed to identify de novo variants present in the affected child and not present in either parent. As the variants underlying a rare disease, such as ALS, are unlikely to be present in the general population, variants present in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; version 2.1) or the Kaviar Genomic Variant database (September 23, 2015, version) were excluded. Synonymous, intronic, and intergenic changes were excluded (  ANNOVAR  ; August 11, 2016, version). Paternity and maternity were confirmed using identity-by-descent analysis, and exome data were reviewed to identify variants in known ALS genes. \n\n\n###  SPTLC1   Sequencing in Adult-Onset ALS \n  \nDNA from 6258 patients with adult-onset ALS were sequenced to identify variants in the   SPTLC1   gene (whole-exome sequencing, 3748 cases ; whole-genome sequencing, 1860 cases; Sanger sequencing, 650 cases) (eTable 2 in the  ). Variants in   SPTLC1   were considered to be deleterious if they (1) were not present in the 4647 controls from the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project; (2) had a frequency less than 3.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910  in human variant databases, including the 51\u2009592 European and 8949 Finnish nonneurological individuals in gnomAD and the 77\u2009301 samples in Kaviar database ; and (3) were designated as damaging according to 4 of 5 prediction algorithms,  were identified as stop gain or frameshift, or were identified as splice-site variants with a dbscSNV score higher than 0.6. Gene burden testing of   SPTLC1   was performed using publicly available control data (gnomAD and Kaviar databases) as implemented in the Test Rare Variants With Public Data (TRAPD) software package version 1.0.  The statistical significance threshold was set at a 1-tailed   P   value less than .05 for single-gene analysis and 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910  for genome-wide significance (.05/20\u2009000 genes). \n\n\n### Cellular Mitochondrial Assays \n  \nVariants were introduced into a plasmid containing the human   SPTLC1   open reading frame (Origene) using the QuikChange II XL kit (Agilent), followed by subcloning into pLenti-C-Myc-DDK-P2A-Puro lentiviral plasmid (Origene). Lentiviruses were produced with third-generation packaging plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-Rev; Addgene) and envelope plasmid (pMD2.G; Addgene).  HEK293FT cells were transfected with wild-type or variant lentivirus transfer plasmid, and transduced cells stably expressing SPTLC1 were selected by extended growth in 0.5-\u03bcg/mL puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the serine rescue experiment, a final concentration of 100-mM L-serine was added to the media for 48 hours. Mitochondria were imaged with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a CellInsight imager (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A minimum of 6 wells were quantified for each condition, and all assays were performed at least twice. Unpaired   t   test with Welch correction or analysis of variance were used to calculate statistical significance. \n\n\n### Sphingolipid Measurements \n  \nPlasma sphingolipid and glucosylceramide measurements were performed at the Biomedical Genetics Clinical Laboratory, Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, Seattle, Washington, using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identification of De Novo Variants in   SPTLC1   Associated With Juvenile ALS \n  \nWe performed whole-exome sequencing in 3 unrelated patients who had been diagnosed with juvenile ALS and their healthy parents ( ;  A to C;  ). The analysis of their genetic data identified de novo variants in the   SPTLC1   gene in each of the 3 patients that were absent in their parents ( E). Patients 1 and 2 carried the same heterozygous p.Ala20Ser variant in   SPTLC1   caused by variation in adjacent nucleotides (chr9:94874844C>A and chr9:94874843G>T; human genome build hg19). Patient 3 carried a p.Ser331Tyr (chr9:94809543G>T) heterozygous variation in   SPTLC1  . Screening of the   SPTLC1   gene in a cohort of 63 patients with juvenile ALS from Turkey who had undergone whole-exome sequencing identified a p.Leu39del (chr9:94874785_94874787del) heterozygous variant in patient 4 ( D). Parental DNA was not available, making it impossible to determine if the deletion had occurred spontaneously. These   SPTLC1   variants were not present in controls or online databases of human variants (142\u2009489 individuals). The p.Ser331Tyr and p.Leu39del amino acid changes have been previously implicated in neurological disease. \n\n\n### Serine and the Damaging Effects of the p.Ala20Ser Variant in Vitro \n  \nVariants in   SPTLC1   are a known cause of autosomal-dominant hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type 1A (HSAN1; OMIM,  ).  The protein encoded by   SPTLC1   is an essential subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids.  A characteristic feature of   SPTLC1   variants associated with HSAN1 is a shift in substrate specificity of SPT to L-alanine and L-glycine, leading to the formation of an atypical class of deoxysphingolipids.  These neurotoxic metabolites accumulate within cells as they cannot be converted to complex sphingolipids nor degraded by the catabolic pathway. \n\nBased on this information, we used a photometric assay of SPT enzyme activity to explore the association of the de novo variants with protein function. We found that the p.Ala20Ser variant SPTLC1 complex had an altered L-alanine and glycine preference over the canonical L-serine compared with the wild-type SPTLC1 complex ( A; eFigure 1 in the  ). Differences were also observed using cell-based assays based on established HSAN1-mitochondrial phenotypes ( B and C; eFigure 1 in the  ).  Mitochondrial size and intensity were defective to the same degree in cells expressing p.Ala20Ser and p.Cys133Trp. These defects were reversed to the wild-type phenotype on serine supplementation in the culture ( B and C; eFigure 1 in the  ). \n   Photometric and Cell-Based Assays in the Presence of Select   SPTLC1   Variants  \nA, The SPTLC1 enzyme complex activity was determined using a photometric assay measuring the release of free coenzyme A (coA) from the condensation reaction between palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine, L-alanine, and L-glycine. The variant p.Ala20Ser and p.Cys133Trp SPTLC1 complex had increased preference for L-alanine and L-glycine over L-serine compared with the wild-type (WT) SPTLC1 complex. B and C, Mitochondria in HEK293 cells expressing WT, p.Ala20Ser, and p.Cys133Trp were assessed using MitoTracker on a high-content imager. Mitochondrial intensity and mitochondria size were smaller in cells expressing variant protein under standard culture conditions. Supplementation of 100 mM L-serine in the culture media for 48 hours rescued the mitochondrial abnormalities in the p.Ala20Ser and p.Cys133Trp lines. \n  \n\n###  SPTLC1   Variants in Patients With Adult-Onset ALS \n  \nHaving established that variants in   SPTLC1   are associated with juvenile ALS, we explored the role of variation in this gene in the pathogenesis of adult-onset ALS by evaluating the occurrence of   SPTLC1   variants in a series of 6258 patients with adult-onset ALS. This screening identified 20 novel   SPTLC1   variants in 23 patients with ALS (0.4%) that were rare or absent in healthy controls and were predicted to be damaging (eTable 3 and eFigures 2 and 3 in the  ). The typical clinical features of ALS were observed among these patients with adult-onset disease, and none of the patients reported sensory or autonomic involvement (eTable 4 in the  ). The intensity and number of motor neurons staining with SPTLC1 were diminished in autopsy tissue obtained from a patient with ALS carrying a p.Arg445Gln variant in   SPTLC1   (eFigure 4 in the  ). Gene burden testing was not significant for   SPTLC1   variants as a cause of adult-onset ALS (87 variants in population samples; uncorrected 1-sided Fisher test   P   value using TRAPD software package\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ; not significant after correction for multiple testing of 20\u2009000 genes). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe provide genetic, biochemical, and cellular data that variations in   SPTLC1   are associated with juvenile ALS. First, we found 3 unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS who carried de novo variants in   SPTLC1   and identified a fourth patient with juvenile ALS carrying another   SPTLC1   variant for whom inheritance could not be determined. These variants were not present in our in-house control data set or in online databases of human variants, indicating they were rare variants in diverse populations. Two of the patients carried the same alanine to serine amino acid shift at position 20 of the protein, which arose from different nucleotide changes. Second, cell-based assays of SPT activity confirmed that the p.Ala20Ser variation altered the encoded enzyme\u2019s function, leading to increased aberrant utilization of alanine and glycine as substrates. This biochemical pattern was consistent with a mechanism reported in patients with HSAN1 caused by   SPTLC1   variants.  Third, we used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that SPTLC1 is abundantly expressed within the motor neurons of healthy spinal cord tissue. \n\nThough labeled as HSAN1, the phenotypes associated with variants in   SPTLC1   are varied, with patients manifesting various combinations of sensory loss, autonomic dysfunction, and motor weakness.  Indeed, there is a previous report of a de novo p.Ser331Tyr variant in   SPTLC1   in a young French girl presenting with a similar phenotype to the patients in this article.  Her clinical picture consisted of severe growth restriction, cognitive impairment, amyotrophy, hyperreflexia, vocal cord paralysis, and respiratory failure, although this patient was not diagnosed as having juvenile ALS. More recently, retinal disease has been reported in patients carrying   SPTLC1   variants.  This clinical heterogeneity has been linked to the differing effects of each variant on SPTLC1 enzyme-substrate preference,  and we observed similar differences in substrate utilization across the variants that we had studied at the enzymatic level ( A). Alternatively, the phenotypes associated with variants in HSAN1 may represent a continuum between sensory neuropathy and ALS. Future postmortem studies that determine the central nervous system pathology (eg, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, tau, \u03b2-amyloid deposition) underlying the motor neuron deficits and the cognitive impairment may resolve the nature of this overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nPerturbed sphingolipid metabolism underlies many neurological disorders, such as Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease,  and may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.  Sphingolipid metabolism has also been implicated in motor neuron degeneration. For example, patients with partial deficiency of hexosaminidase A enzyme activity (also known as GM2 gangliosidosis, a form of sphingolipidosis) may have clinical manifestations mimicking ALS.  The accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol esters also occurs within the spinal cords of patients with ALS and an   SOD1   transgenic mouse model of ALS. \n\nOwing to the poor prognosis observed among patients with juvenile ALS and work published by other groups,  patient 2 was commenced on high-dose (10 g per day) oral serine supplementation on a compassionate basis. Her body weight increased during this off-label treatment, which was the first time she had gained weight in several years. The patient\u2019s ceramide levels were within normal range and trending downwards, indicating that ceramide toxic effects, a theoretical possibility with serine treatment, were not present (eFigure 5 and eTable 5 in the  ). We did not observe evidence of neurological improvement, although prolonged therapy would be required to detect such an effect. \n\nSerine is a nonessential amino acid that is available as a low-cost nutritional supplement. A 10% serine-enriched diet was associated with a reduction in neurotoxic deoxysphingolipid plasma levels both in transgenic mice expressing the p.Cys133Trp   SPTLC1   variant and in human patients diagnosed with HSAN1.  Furthermore, a safety trial involving 20 patients with adult-onset ALS demonstrated that high doses of oral serine are well tolerated and that this polar amino acid is actively transported across the blood-brain barrier.  Nutritional supplementation has proven to be remarkably effective in other forms of ALS.  Despite these supportive data, future clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety profile of serine supplementation in patients with juvenile ALS owing to   SPTLC1   variants. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study had limitations. DNA was not available from the parents of patient 4, so it was not possible to determine whether or not the variation arose spontaneously. Nevertheless, the lack of a family history supports the possibility that this variant was de novo in origin; there is only a 3.1% chance that none of her 5 siblings would have inherited an autosomal-dominant variant from a transmitting parent. Our evidence also demonstrates that variants in   SPTLC1   are not a common cause of adult-onset ALS. Overall, our data imply that the genetic causes of juvenile ALS and adult-onset ALS are distinct. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our data broaden the phenotype associated with variants in   SPTLC1   to include juvenile ALS and implicate sphingolipid metabolism as a pathway in motor neuron disease. Our findings are relevant in light of the fact that nutritional supplementation with serine has been postulated to ameliorate the toxic effect of abnormal sphingolipid metabolites if instituted at an early stage in the disease.  In such cases, abnormal plasma metabolites could be used as a marker of target engagement.  This provides an early opportunity for future clinical trials to test the precision medicine approach in an otherwise fatal neurodegenerative disease. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8406220, "text_md5": "0456948f6d7890871c99ab9eb95ee57e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 6342], "journal": [6343, 6354], "publication_year": [6356, 6360], "title": [6371, 6457], "keywords": [6471, 6471], "abstract": [6484, 9526], "body": [9535, 31615]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34459874, "doi": "10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.2598", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406220", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8406220"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406220\">8406220</a>", "list_title": "PMC8406220  Association of Variants in the SPTLC1 Gene With Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"}

While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates.

Here, the authors show that many commonly used methods are biased and can produce false discoveries. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe abundance of RNA species informs on the past, present and future state of cells and tissues. By enabling the complete quantification of mRNA populations, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided unprecedented access to the molecular processes active in a biological sample . Diseases, traumas, and experimental manipulations perturb these processes, which leads to changes in the expression of specific mRNAs. Historically, these altered mRNAs were identified using bulk RNA-seq in non-perturbed versus perturbed tissues . However, biological tissues are composed of multiple cell types, whose responses to a perturbation can differ dramatically. Changes in mRNA abundance within multicellular tissues are confounded by different responses across cell types and changes in the relative abundance of these cell types . Consequently, the resolution of bulk RNA-seq is insufficient to characterize the multifaceted responses to biological perturbations. \n\nSingle-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of RNA abundance at the resolution of individual cells . The maturation of single-cell technologies now enables large-scale comparisons of cell states within complex tissues, thus providing the appropriate resolution to dissect cell-type-specific responses to perturbation . The sparsity and heterogeneity of single-cell data initially encouraged the development of specialized statistical methods to identify differentially expressed mRNAs . The proliferation of statistical methods for differential expression analysis prompted investigators to ask which methods produced the most biologically accurate results. To answer this question, investigators turned to simulations in an attempt to create a ground truth against which the various methods could be benchmarked. However, simulations require specifying a model from which synthetic patterns of differential expression are generated. Differences in the specification of this model have led investigators to contrasting conclusions . \n\nThese divergences emphasize the importance of developing a sound epistemological foundation for differential expression in single-cell data . In this work, we reasoned that developing such a foundation would require quantifying the performance of the available methods across multiple datasets in which an experimental ground truth is known, and defining the principles that are responsible for differences in performance. We therefore first established a methodological framework that enabled us to curate a resource of ground-truth datasets. Using this resource, we conduct a definitive comparison of the various available methods for differential expression analysis. We find that differences in the performance of these methods reflect the failure of certain methods to account for intrinsic variation between biological replicates. Our understanding of this principle led us to discover that the most frequently used methods can identify differentially expressed genes even in the absence of biological differences. These false discoveries are poised to mislead investigators. However, we show that false discoveries can be avoided using statistical methodologies that account for between-replicate variation. In summary, we expose the principles that underlie valid differential expression analysis in single-cell data, and provide a toolbox to implement relevant statistical methods for single-cell users. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### A ground-truth resource to benchmark single-cell differential expression \n  \nWe aimed to compare available statistical methods for differential expression (DE) analysis based on their ability to generate biologically accurate results. We reasoned that performing this comparison in real datasets where the experimental ground truth is known would faithfully reflect differences in the performance of these methods, while avoiding the shortcomings of simulated data. We posited that the closest possible approximation to this ground truth could be obtained from matched bulk and scRNA-seq performed on the same population of purified cells, exposed to the same perturbations, and sequenced in the same laboratories. An extensive survey of the literature identified a total of eighteen \u2018gold standard\u2019 datasets that met these criteria (Fig.\u00a0 ) . This compendium allowed us to carry out a large-scale comparison of DE methods in experimental settings where the ground truth is known.    A systematic benchmark of differential expression in single-cell transcriptomics.  \n a   Schematic overview of the eighteen ground-truth datasets analyzed in this study.   b   Statistical methods for DE analysis employed in 500 recent scRNA-seq papers.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\n\n### Pseudobulk methods outperform generic and specialized single-cell DE methods \n  \nWe selected a total of fourteen DE methods, representing the most widely used statistical approaches for single-cell transcriptomics, to compare (Methods, \u201cDifferential expression analysis methods\u201d). Together, these methods have been used by almost 90% of recent studies (Fig.\u00a0 ). We evaluated the relative performance of each method based on the concordance between DE results in bulk versus scRNA-seq datasets. To quantify this concordance, we calculated the area under the concordance curve (AUCC) between the results of bulk versus scRNA-seq datasets . \n\nWe compared the performance of the fourteen methods across the entire compendium of the eighteen gold standard datasets. This analysis immediately revealed that all six of the top-performing methods shared a common analytical property. These methods aggregated cells within a biological replicate, to form so-called \u2018pseudobulks\u2019, before applying a statistical test (Fig.\u00a0 ) . In comparison, methods that compared individual cells performed poorly. The differences between pseudobulk and single-cell methods were highly significant (Fig.\u00a0 ), and robust to the methodology used to quantify concordance (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, comparisons to matching proteomics data  revealed that pseudobulk methods also more accurately predicted changes in protein abundance (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWe asked whether the differences between DE methods could also impact the functional interpretation of transcriptomic experiments. For this purpose, we compared Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses in bulk versus scRNA-seq DE. We found that pseudobulk methods again more faithfully reflected the ground truth, as captured in the bulk RNA-seq (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). For example, single-cell methods failed to identify the relevant GO term when comparing mouse phagocytes stimulated with poly(I:C) , a synthetic double-stranded RNA (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Single-cell DE methods are biased towards highly expressed genes \n  \nThe unexpected superiority of pseudobulk methods compelled us to study the mechanisms that are responsible for their ability to recapitulate biological ground truth. To investigate these mechanisms, we formulated and tested several hypotheses that could potentially explain these differences in performance. \n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that inferences about DE are generally more accurate for highly expressed genes . Measurements of gene expression in single cells are inherently sparse. By aggregating cells within each replicate, pseudobulk methods dramatically reduce the number of zeros in the data, especially for lowly expressed genes (Fig.\u00a0 ). Consequently, we initially hypothesized that the difference in accuracy between pseudobulk and single-cell methods could be explained by superior performance of pseudobulk methods among lowly expressed genes.    Single-cell DE methods are biased towards highly expressed genes.  \n a   Schematic illustration of the creation of \u2018pseudobulks\u2019 from single-cell data. Top, biological replicate from which each cell was obtained. Bottom, simulated gene expression matrix. Read counts for each gene are aggregated across cells of a given type within each biological replicate.   b   Mean AUCCs across eighteen ground-truth datasets after dividing the transcriptome into terciles of lowly, moderately, or highly expressed genes.   c   Mean expression levels of the 100 top-ranked false-positive genes from each DE method.   d   Spearman correlation between the mean expression of 80 ERCC spike-ins expressed in at least three cells and the \u2013log  p  -value of differential expression assigned by each DE method.   e   Scatterplots of mean ERCC expression vs. \u2013log  p  -value for exemplary single-cell and pseudobulk DE methods. Trend lines and shaded areas show local polynomial regression and the 95% confidence interval, respectively.   f   Mean expression levels of the 200 top-ranked genes from each DE method in a collection of 46 scRNA-seq datasets. \n  \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we allocated genes into three equally sized bins, comprising lowly, moderately, and highly expressed genes. We then re-calculated the concordance between bulk and scRNA-seq DE within each bin. Contrary to our prediction, we observed minimal differences between pseudobulk and single-cell methods for lowly expressed genes (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Instead, the most pronounced differences between pseudobulk and single-cell methods emerged among highly expressed genes. \n\nThis unexpected result led us to ask whether single-cell DE methods produce systematic errors for highly expressed genes. To explore this possibility, we scrutinized the bulk datasets to identify genes falsely called as DE by each method within scRNA-seq data. We found that false positives identified by single-cell DE methods were more highly expressed than those identified by pseudobulk methods (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Conversely, false-negatives overlooked by single-cell DE methods tended to be lowly expressed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Together, these findings implied a systematic tendency for single-cell methods to identify highly expressed genes as DE, even when their expression remained unchanged. \n\nTo validate this conclusion experimentally, we analyzed a dataset in which a population of synthetic mRNAs were spiked into each well containing a single cell . Each of these single-cell libraries therefore contained equal concentrations of each synthetic mRNA. We found that single-cell methods incorrectly identified many abundant spike-ins as DE (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, pseudobulk methods avoided this bias. \n\nWe then asked whether this bias was universal in single-cell transcriptomics. We assembled a compendium of 46 scRNA-seq datasets that encompassed disparate species, cell types, technologies, and biological perturbations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We found that single-cell DE methods displayed a systematic preference for highly expressed genes across the entire compendium (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTogether, these experiments suggest that the inferior performance of single-cell methods can be attributed to their bias towards highly expressed genes. \n\n\n### DE analysis of single-cell data must account for biological replicates \n  \nThese findings implied that pseudobulk methods possess a common analytical property that allows them to avoid this bias. We conducted a series of experiments to identify this mechanism. \n\nThe statistical tools applied to identify DE genes in pseudobulk data (i.e., edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) have been refined over many years of development. We therefore asked whether these methods incorporate inherent advantages that are independent from the procedure of aggregating gene expression across cells. To test this possibility, we disabled the aggregation procedure and applied the pseudobulk methods to individual cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). Strikingly, this procedure abolished the superiority of the pseudobulk methods (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The emergence of a bias towards highly expressed genes paralleled this decrease in performance (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ).    DE analysis of single-cell data must account for biological replicates.  \n a   Schematic illustration of the experiment shown in   b  , in which the aggregation procedure was disabled and pseudobulk DE methods were applied to individual cells.   b   Left, AUCC of the original fourteen DE methods, plus six pseudobulk methods applied to individual cells, in the eighteen ground-truth datasets. Right, Spearman correlation between ERCC mean expression and \u2013log  p-value assigned by six pseudobulk DE methods, before and after disabling the aggregation procedure.   c   Schematic illustration of the experiment shown in   d  , in which the replicate associated with each cell was shuffled to produce \u2018pseudo-replicates.\u2019   d   Left, AUCC of the original fourteen DE methods, plus six pseudobulk methods applied to pseudo-replicates, in the eighteen ground-truth datasets. Right, Spearman correlation between ERCC mean expression and \u2013log  p-value assigned by six pseudobulk DE methods, before and after shuffling replicates to produce pseudo-replicates.   e   Variance of gene expression in pseudobulks formed from biological replicates and pseudo-replicates in mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells stimulated with poly-I:C. Shuffling the replicate associated with each cell produced a systematic decrease in the variance of gene expression. Right, pie chart shows the proportion of genes with increased or decreased variance in pseudo-replicates, as compared to biological replicates.   f   Decreases in the variance of gene expression in pseudo-replicates as compared to biological replicates across 46 scRNA-seq datasets. Points show the mean variance in biological replicates; arrowheads show the mean variance in pseudo-replicates.   g   Left, expression of the gene c in biological replicates (points) and pseudo-replicates (arrowheads) from unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with poly-I:C, with the range of possible pseudo-replicate expression values shown as a density. Right, mean (horizontal line) and variance (shaded area) of Txnrd3 expression in biological replicates (left) and pseudo-replicates (right). P-values were calculated by edgeR-LRT. \n  \n\nThis result raised the possibility that the aggregation procedure itself was directly responsible for the superiority of pseudobulk methods. To evaluate this notion, we applied the aggregation procedure to random groups of cells, which produced a pseudobulk matrix composed of \u2018pseudo-replicates\u2019 (Fig.\u00a0 ). This experiment induced a similar decrease in the performance of pseudobulk methods, combined with the re-emergence of a bias towards highly expressed genes (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWe sought to understand the common factors that could explain the decreased performance of pseudobulk methods in these two experiments. We recognized that both experiments entailed a loss of information about biological replicates. Aggregating random groups of cells to form pseudo-replicates, or ignoring replicates altogether in comparisons of single cells, both introduced a bias towards highly expressed genes and a corresponding loss of performance. \n\nWithin the same experimental condition, replicates exhibit inherent differences in gene expression, which reflect both biological and technical factors . We reasoned that failing to account for these differences could lead methods to misattribute the inherent variability between replicates to the effect of the perturbation. To study this potential mechanism, we compared the variance in the expression of each gene in pseudobulks and pseudo-replicates. Initially, we performed this comparison in a dataset of bone marrow mononuclear cells stimulated with poly-I:C . We found that shuffling the replicates produced a systematic decrease in the variance of gene expression, affecting 98.2% of genes (Fig.\u00a0 ). We next tested whether this decrease in variance occurred systematically across our compendium of 46 datasets. Every comparison displayed the same decrease in the variance of gene expression (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nThe decrease in the variance of gene expression led statistical tests to attribute small changes in gene expression to the effect of the perturbation. For instance, in the poly-I:C dataset, failing to account for the variable expression of   Txnrd3   across replicates led to the spurious identification of this gene as differentially expressed (Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, we found that highly expressed genes exhibited the largest decrease in variance in pseudo-replicates, thus explaining the bias of single-cell methods towards highly expressed genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTogether, this series of experiments exposed the principle underlying the unexpected superiority of pseudobulk methods. Statistical methods for differential expression must account for the intrinsic variability of biological replicates to generate biologically accurate results in single-cell data. Accounting for this variability allows pseudobulk methods to correctly identify changes in gene expression caused by a biological perturbation. In contrast, failing to account for biological replicates causes single-cell methods to systematically underestimate the variance of gene expression. This underestimation of the variance biases single-cell methods towards highly expressed genes, compromising their ability to generate biologically accurate results. \n\n\n### False discoveries in single-cell DE \n  \nWe realized that if failing to account for the variation between biological replicates could produce false discoveries in the presence of a real biological perturbation, then false discoveries might also arise in the absence of any biological difference. To test this possibility, we simulated single-cell data with different degrees of heterogeneity between replicates in the absence of any difference between groups (Fig.\u00a0 ). We randomly assigned each replicate to an artificial \u2018control\u2019 or \u2018treatment\u2019 group, and tested for DE between the two conditions. Strikingly, single-cell methods identified hundreds of DE genes in the absence of any perturbation (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, in line with our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the failure of single-cell DE methods, the genes that were falsely called as DE were those whose expression was most variable between replicates (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Pseudobulk methods abolished the false detection of DE genes. However, creating pseudo-replicates led to the reappearance of spurious DE genes (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), further corroborating the requirements for accurate DE analyses. The number of false discoveries was reduced when additional replicates were introduced to the dataset (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, introducing additional cells to the simulated data only exacerbated the underlying problem (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ).    False discoveries in single-cell DE.  \n a   Schematic illustration of simulation experiments. Single-cell RNA-seq datasets were simulated with varying degrees of heterogeneity between replicates. Replicates were then randomly assigned to either a \u2018treatment\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019 group, and DE analysis was performed between groups.   b   Number of DE genes detected in stimulation experiments with varying degrees of heterogeneity between replicates by a representative single-cell DE method, a representative pseudobulk method, and the same pseudobulk method applied to pseudo-replicates. Points and error bars show the mean and standard deviation across ten independent simulations.   c   Number of DE genes detected by the tests shown in   b   for genes divided into deciles by the magnitude of the change in variance between biological replicates and pseudo-replicates (\u2206-variance).   d   Volcano plots showing DE between T cells from random groups of unstimulated controls drawn from Kang et al.  using a representative pseudobulk method, edgeR-LRT, applied to biological replicates or pseudo-replicates.

To explore this possibility, we initially analyzed a dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to interferon . We extracted the control samples that had not been exposed to interferon, and split them randomly into two groups. We then performed DE analysis. Failing to account for the intrinsic variability of biological replicates produced hundreds of DE genes between randomly assigned replicates (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nUnsettled by this appearance of false discoveries, we asked whether this observation reflected a universal pitfall. To address this concern comprehensively, we identified a total of fourteen datasets that included at least six replicates in the control condition. As in the previous experiment, we split these unperturbed samples randomly into synthetic control and treatment groups, before conducting DE analyses between these two groups. This systematic analysis confirmed that single-cell methods produced a systematic excess of false positives compared to pseudobulk methods (Fig.\u00a0 ). The resulting DE genes were enriched for hundreds of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, despite a complete absence of biological perturbation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, we again confirmed that the genes falsely identified as DE corresponded to those with the highest variability between replicates (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTogether, these experiments exposed a fundamental pitfall for DE analysis in single-cell transcriptomics. We intuited, however, that this pitfall could afflict any technology in which many observations are obtained from each biological replicate. For example, we anticipated that false discoveries would also emerge in spatial transcriptomics data . To test this prediction, we analyzed a spatial transcriptomics dataset that profiled spinal cords from a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) . We randomly partitioned data from control mice into two groups, and performed DE within each region of the spinal cord. Statistical methods that failed to account for variability between biological replicates identified thousands of DE genes within each region (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, pseudobulk methods abolished these false discoveries. \n\nThese experiments demonstrated that the variability between biological replicates can confound the identification of genes affected by a biological perturbation. Many of the factors that produce this variability between replicates can be minimized in animal models, including the genetic background, environment, intensity and timing of the biological perturbation, and sample processing. In contrast, these sources of variation are inherently more difficult to control in experiments involving human subjects. This distinction raised the possibility that single-cell studies of human tissue would exhibit greater variability between biological replicates, and consequently, would be more vulnerable to false discoveries. To evaluate this possibility systematically, we calculated the variability between replicates within 41 human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets. In agreement with our hypothesis, we detected significantly more variability between replicates in the human datasets (Fig.\u00a0 ). While we show that accounting for biological replicates is critical for any DE analysis, this result stresses the paramount importance of addressing this issue in single-cell studies of human tissue. \n\n\n### True and false discoveries in the injured mouse spinal cord \n  \nWe finally sought to demonstrate the extent to which DE analyses can produce true and false discoveries in previously unexplored biological tissues. For this purpose, we characterized the impact of a spinal cord injury (SCI) on gene expression in cells located below the injury. We specifically focused on the lumbar spinal cord, since this region undergoes multifaceted changes that lead to the irreversible degradation of neuronal function . \n\nWe performed experiments in mice that received a severe contusion of the mid-thoracic spinal cord (Fig.\u00a0 ). Multifactorial quantification of whole-body kinematics revealed profound impairments in the ability of the mice to produce locomotion (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We found that the injury triggered the aberrant growth of new synapses throughout lumbar segments, combined with the emergence of abnormal segmental reflexes (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). This chaotic reorganization of circuits below the SCI has been linked to spasticity and neuronal dysfunction (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ) .

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nWe then harvested the lumbar spinal cords of mice with chronic SCI and uninjured controls, and performed single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of these tissues . We sequenced a total of 19,237 cells that encompassed all the major cell types of the lumbar spinal cord (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWe initially aimed to identify the cell types in which transcription was most perturbed by the injury. To answer this question, we performed cell type prioritization using Augur . This unbiased analysis indicated that endothelial cells underwent the most profound transcriptional changes in the spinal cord below the injury (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nThis unexpected finding spurred us to investigate the specific transcriptional changes underlying this prioritization, and the capacity of different statistical methods to reveal these changes. For this purpose, we performed DE analyses between injured and uninjured endothelial cells using representative single-cell and pseudobulk methods. We selected the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as a single-cell method, since this test has been the most widely used approach in the field of single-cell transcriptomics (Fig.\u00a0 ), and edgeR-LRT  as a pseudobulk method due to its high level of performance (Fig.\u00a0 ). These methods identified largely distinct sets of DE genes, with only four genes overlapping between the two methods. Conversely, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and edgeR-LRT each nominated an additional 44 and 12 genes as DE, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nOur results thus far have demonstrated that failing to account for variation between replicates can lead single-cell DE methods to produce false discoveries. We therefore suspected that some of the additional genes identified by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in this dataset could represent false positives. To clarify the ground truth expression of these genes in the injured spinal cord, we carried out a systematic in vivo screen. We obtained RNAscope probes for nineteen putatively DE genes identified by only one of the two methods, and quantified the expression of these genes in endothelial cells from injured and uninjured mice  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). RNAscope validated five of the six genes called as DE by edgeR-LRT. In marked contrast, only three of thirteen genes called as DE by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test could be corroborated (p\u2009<\u20090.05, \u03c7  test; Fig.\u00a0 ). Several of the validated edgeR-LRT genes, including   Slc7a11   and   Igfbp6  , are involved in the response to hypoxia within endothelial cells, supporting the establishment of a chronically hypoxic state in the lumbar spinal cord . In line with the expected consequences of chronic hypoxia, we detected the presence of numerous atrophic blood vessels below the level of injury (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nTogether, these observations illustrate the potential for single-cell DE methods to produce false discoveries. Conversely, valid single-cell DE analysis that accounted for variation between biological replicates yielded reproducible conclusions that could be validated in vivo. \n\n\n### DE analysis with mixed models \n  \nOur experiments established that accounting for variation between biological replicates dictated the performance of single-cell DE methods. We were therefore puzzled by the unsatisfying performance of a linear mixed model. By explicitly modeling variation both within and between biological replicates, mixed models should benefit from increased statistical power compared to pseudobulk methods . To clarify this discrepancy, we evaluated eight additional Poisson or negative binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In datasets of 25-50 cells, GLMMs could produce accurate results under very specific parameter combinations. However, in datasets comprising 500 or more cells, their performance converged to that of pseudobulk DE methods. Moreover, the computational resources required to fit the best-performing GLMMs were enormous. Even in downsampled datasets, DE analysis of a single cell type took an average of 13.5\u2009h (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, pseudobulk methods required only minutes per cell type in our compendium of 46 datasets (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These observations suggest that, in practice, pseudobulk approaches provide an excellent trade-off between speed and accuracy for single-cell DE analysis. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAccurate DE analysis in single-cell transcriptomics is required to dissect the transcriptional programs underlying the multifaceted responses to disease, trauma, and experimental manipulations. Despite the importance of statistical methods for DE analyses, the principles that determine their performance have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the central principle underlying valid DE analysis is the ability of statistical methods to account for the intrinsic variability of biological replicates. Accounting for this variability dictates the biological accuracy of statistical methods. Conversely, methods that fail to account for the variability of biological replicates can produce hundreds of false discoveries in the absence of any biological difference. \n\nInvestigators study single cells to understand more general principles underlying the response to a biological perturbation. Clarifying these principles requires statistical inferences that generalize beyond the individual cells that constitute any particular dataset. Our results demonstrate that by performing a statistical inference at the level of individual cells, single-cell DE methods conflate variability between biological replicates with the effect of a biological perturbation. The presence of variability between replicates is unavoidable, and can be attributed to both technical factors and intrinsic biological differences . The possibility that conflating variability between replicates with the biological effect of interest can lead to spurious findings has previously been recognized . However, these studies relied almost entirely on synthetic data, supplemented by a few illustrative case studies. Consequently, the pervasiveness of false discoveries in published analyses of single-cell data and the propensity for these false discoveries to affect the biological conclusions of a study have remained unclear. \n\nHere, we show that the appearance of false discoveries is a universal phenomenon. Leveraging a collection of 18 single-cell datasets with an experimental ground truth, we demonstrate that the use of inappropriate statistical methodology can produce false discoveries that compromise the biological interpretation of a single-cell experiment. These false discoveries have the potential to squander time, effort, and financial resources in pursuit of misleading hypotheses. For example, we show through a systematic in vivo screen of the injured mouse spinal cord that most DE genes identified by the most commonly used statistical method are false discoveries. Moreover, we elucidate the progression of mechanisms by which failing to account for biological and technical variability makes certain genes disproportionately likely to be spuriously identified as DE. We demonstrate the universality of these mechanisms in multifaceted datasets from an additional 46 single-cell RNA-seq studies. Understanding these mechanisms led us to discover that the same fundamental issues affect other high-dimensional assays, including spatial transcriptomics, and are most likely to manifest in studies of human tissue, suggesting that inference at the level of biological replicates is critical to understand the cellular and molecular basis for human disease. \n\nOur results demonstrate that single-cell DE methods are poised to produce false discoveries. This understanding uncovers an enormous risk for the field. Our findings suggest that many published findings may be false. Moreover, if left unresolved, substantial research funding may be allocated to follow up on these false discoveries, to the detriment of science. However, this concerning possibility is straightforward to correct with the use of DE methods that account for variability between replicates. Among these, we found that pseudobulk methods achieve the highest fidelity to the experimental ground truth at the levels of the transcriptome, proteome, and functional interpretation. Consequently, we contend that there is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in the statistical methods that are used for DE analysis of single-cell data. The need for such a shift is underscored by our observation that most studies published in the past two years have used inappropriate statistical methods for DE analysis. Moreover, the most widely used analysis packages in the field currently employ DE methods prone to false discoveries by default . The increasing prevalence of multi-condition datasets stresses the importance of employing appropriate statistical methodologies to prevent a proliferation of false discoveries. To catalyze this transition, we implement all of the methods tested here in an R package (Supplementary Software\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature review \n  \nTo identify which statistical methods for DE analysis have been most commonly used within the field, we conducted an extensive literature review. We annotated the statistical method used to perform DE analysis across experimental conditions within cell types for each publication included in a large, curated database of scRNA-seq studies . The database was accessed on November 4, 2020. Because the single-cell studies catalogued in this database span a long period of time, and we aimed to establish which methods for DE analysis are currently in wide use, we limited our analysis to the 500 most recently published studies. Accordingly, the inclusion criteria for our review were (i) studies present in the curated database as of November 4, 2020, and (i) studies within the 500 most recent entries in this database at the time it was accessed. Each of these 500 studies were then manually reviewed to determine the statistical methodology used to compare cells of the same type between experimental conditions. We did not annotate methods used to identify genes differentially expressed between cell types (i.e., marker gene identification), as this problem presents a distinct set of statistical challenges . In total, 205 of the 500 studies conducted DE analysis between biological conditions. The complete list of all 500 studies is provided as Source Data. \n\n\n### Ground-truth datasets \n  \nPrevious benchmarks of DE analysis methods for single-cell transcriptomics have relied heavily on simulated data, or else have compared the results of different methods in scenarios where no ground truth was available . We reasoned that the best possible approximation to the biological ground truth in a scRNA-seq experiment would consist of a matched bulk RNA-seq dataset in the same purified cell type, exposed to the same perturbation under identical experimental conditions, and sequenced in the same laboratory. We surveyed the literature to identify such matching single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets, which led us to compile a resource of eighteen ground truth datasets from four publications . Datasets of mouse, rat, pig, and rabbit bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or poly-I:C for 4\u2009h were obtained from Hagai et al.  Datasets of naive or memory T cells stimulated for 5 d with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads in the presence or absence of various combinations of cytokines (Th0: anti-CD3/anti-CD28 alone; Th2: IL-4, anti-IFN\u03b3; Th17: TGF\u03b2, IL6, IL23, IL1\u03b2, anti-IFN\u03b3, anti-IL4; iTreg: TGF\u03b2, IL2) were obtained from Cano-Gamez et al.  We additionally obtained label-free quantitative proteomics data for the same comparisons from this study. Datasets of alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes from young (3\u2009m) and old (24\u2009m) mice were obtained from Angelidis et al.  Datasets of alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and control individuals were obtained from Reyfman et al. \n\n\n### Differential expression analysis methods \n  \nWe compared fourteen statistical methods for DE analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data on their ability to recover ground-truth patterns of DE, as established through bulk RNA-seq analysis of matching cell populations. These fourteen methods comprised seven statistical tests that compared gene expression in individual cells (\u201csingle-cell methods\u201d); six tests that aggregated cells within a biological replicate to form pseudobulks before performing statistical analysis (\u201cpseudobulk methods\u201d); and a linear mixed model. \n\nThe seven single-cell methods analyzed here included a t-test, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logistic regression , negative binomial and Poisson generalized linear models, a likelihood ratio test , and the two-part hurdle model implemented by MAST . The implementation provided in the Seurat function \u2018FindMarkers\u2019 was used for all seven tests, with all filters (\u2018min.pct\u2019, \u2018min.cells.feature\u2019, and \u2018logfc.threshold\u2019) disabled. In addition, we implemented a linear mixed model within Seurat, using the \u2018lmerTest\u2019 R package to optimize the restricted maximum likelihood and obtain p-values from the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom. We observed that some statistical tests returned a large number of p-values below the double precision limit in R (approximately 2 \u00d7 10 ), potentially confounding the calculation of the concordance metrics described below. To avoid this pitfall, we modified the Seurat implementation to also return the value of the test statistic from which the p-value was derived. The modified version of Seurat 3.1.5 used to perform all single-cell DE analyses reported in this study is available from  . \n\nThe pseudobulk methods employed the DESeq2 , edgeR , and limma  packages for analysis of aggregated read counts. Briefly, for cells of a given type, we first aggregated reads across biological replicates, transforming a genes-by-cells matrix to a genes-by-replicates matrix using matrix multiplication. For DESeq2, we used both a Wald test of the negative binomial model coefficients (DESeq2-Wald) as well as a likelihood ratio test compared to a reduced model (DESeq2-LRT) to compute the statistical significance. For edgeR, we used both the likelihood ratio test (edgeR-LRT)  as well as the quasi-likelihood F-test approach (edgeR-QLF) . For limma, we compared two modes: limma-trend, which incorporates the mean-variance trend into the empirical Bayes procedure at the gene level, and voom (limma-voom), which incorporates the mean-variance trend by assigning a weight to each individual observation . Log-transformed counts per million values computed by edgeR were provided as input to limma-trend. \n\nDE analysis of bulk RNA-seq datasets was performed with six methods (DESeq2-LRT, DESeq2-Wald, edgeR-LRT, edgeR-QLF, limma-trend, and limma-voom), except for the two pulmonary fibrosis datasets ; for these datasets, the raw bulk RNA-seq data from sorted cells could not be obtained, so only the results of the bulk DE analysis performed by the authors of the original publication were used. The AUCC and rank correlation were calculated for each bulk DE analysis method separately, and subsequently averaged over all six methods. DE analysis of normalized bulk proteomics data was performed using the moderated t-test implemented within limma, as in the original publication. \n\n\n### Measuring concordance between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq \n  \nTo evaluate the concordance between DE analyses of matched single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data, we computed two metrics, designed to evaluate the concordance between only the most highly ranked subset of DE genes and across the entire transcriptome, respectively. To calculate the first of these metrics, the area under the concordance curve (AUCC) , we ranked genes in both the single-cell and bulk datasets in descending order by the statistical significance of their differential expression. Then, we created lists of the top-ranked genes in each dataset of matching size, up to some maximum size   k  . For each of these lists (that is, for the top-1 genes, top-2 genes, top-3 genes, and so on), we computed the size of the intersection between the single-cell and bulk DE genes. This procedure yielded a curve relating the number of shared genes between datasets to the number of top-ranked genes considered. The area under this curve was computed by summing the size of all intersections, and normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing it by its maximum possible value,   k   \u00d7 (  k  \u2009+\u20091) / 2. To evaluate the concordance of DE analysis, we used   k  \u2009=\u2009500 except where otherwise noted, but found our results were insensitive to the precise value of   k  . To compute the second metric, the transcriptome-wide rank correlation, we multiplied the absolute value of the test statistic for each gene by the sign of its log-fold change between conditions, and then computed the Spearman correlation over genes between the single-cell and bulk datasets. \n\nIn addition to evaluating the consistency of DE analyses at the gene level, we also asked whether each DE method yielded broader patterns of functional enrichment that were similar between the single-cell and bulk datasets, allowing for some divergence in the rankings of individual genes. To address this question, we performed gene set enrichment analysis  using the \u2018fgsea\u2019 R package . GO term annotations for human and mouse (2019-12-09 release) were obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium website. GO terms annotated to less than 10 genes or more than 1,000 genes within each dataset were excluded in order to mitigate the influence of very specific or very broad terms. Genes were ranked in descending order by the absolute value of the test statistic, and 10  permutations were performed. To evaluate the concordance of GO term enrichment, we used   k  \u2009=\u2009100, on the basis that fewer top-ranked GO terms are generally of interest than are top-ranked genes. \n\n\n### Impact of mean expression \n  \nWe initially hypothesized that differences between single-cell DE analysis methods could be attributed to their differing sensitivities towards lowly expressed genes. To explore this hypothesis, we performed the following analyses. First, we divided genes from the eighteen gold standard datasets into three equally sized bins on the basis of their mean expression, then re-calculated the AUCC as described above within each bin separately. Second, we inspected the properties of genes falsely called as DE in the single-cell data (false positives) or incorrectly inferred to be unchanging in the single-cell data (false negatives). To identify false positive genes, we used the bulk DE analysis to exclude genes called as DE at a false discovery rate of 10% from the matched single-cell results, then retained the 100 top-ranked remaining genes in the single-cell data. To identify false negative genes, we used the bulk DE analysis to identify genes called as DE at a false discovery rate of 10%, but with a false discovery rate exceeding 10% in the matched single-cell results, again retaining the 100 top-ranked such genes. For each of these genes, we computed both the mean expression level and the proportion of zero gene expression measurements. Third, we analyzed a Smart-seq2 dataset of human dermal fibroblasts stimulated with interferon-\u03b2, in which a mixture of synthetic RNAs was spiked into each individual cell . We performed DE analysis on the synthetic spike-ins, then calculated the Spearman correlation between the mean expression level of each spike-in and the statistical significance of differential expression, as assigned by each single-cell DE method. Fourth, we assembled a compendium of 46 published scRNA-seq datasets, and asked whether the genes called as DE by each method tended to be more or less highly expressed across the entire compendium. Complete details on the preprocessing of these 46 datasets are provided below. Because each of these datasets were sequenced to different depths, and captured different total numbers of genes (depending on both the sequencing depth and the biological system under study), mean expression values were not directly comparable across datasets. To enable such a comparison, we first calculated the mean expression for each gene, then converted this value into the quantile of mean expression using the empirical cumulative distribution function. We then calculated the mean expression quantile of the 200 top-ranked genes from each method in each of the 46 datasets. \n\n\n### Dissecting pseudobulk DE methods \n  \nTo understand the principles underlying the improved performance of the six pseudobulk DE methods, we performed the following analyses. First, we disabled the aggregation procedure that led to the creation of pseudobulks (that is, we treated each individual cell as its own replicate), then performed an identical DE analysis of individual cells. For each DE method, we then re-calculated both the AUCC and the bias towards highly expressed genes, as quantified by (i) the rank correlation to mean-spike in expression, and (ii) the expression quantile across 46 scRNA-seq datasets. Second, we aggregated random groups of cells into \u2018pseudo-replicates\u2019 by randomizing the replicate associated with each cell. We then again re-calculated both the AUCC and the bias towards highly expressed genes. \n\nThese experiments led us to suspect that discarding information about the inherent variability of biological replicates caused both the bias towards highly expressed genes and the attendant decrease in performance. To test this hypothesis, we compared the variance of gene expression in pseudobulks and pseudo-replicates. For each gene, we calculated the difference in variance (\u2206-variance) between pseudobulks and pseudo-replicates. We initially visualized the \u2206-variance in an exemplary dataset, consisting of mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells stimulated with poly-I:C12. Subsequently, we calculated the mean \u2206-variance across all genes in each of the 46 datasets in our scRNA-seq compendium, observing a decrease in the variance in all 46 cases. To clarify the relationship between the \u2206-variance and mean gene expression, we computed the correlation between \u2206-variance and mean expression, first in the poly-I:C dataset and then across all 46 datasets in the compendium. We observed a significant negative correlation, confirming that the variance of highly expressed genes is disproportionately underestimated when discarding information about biological replicates. We performed a similar analysis correlating the original variance of gene expression to the \u2206-variance, demonstrating that the variance of the most variable genes is disproportionately underestimated when discarding information about biological replicates. However, in partial correlation analyses, only gene expression variance remained correlated with \u2206-variance, implying that failing to account for biological replicates induces a bias towards highly expressed genes because these genes are also more variably expressed. Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  employ the signed pseudo-logarithm transformation from the \u2018ggallin\u2019 R package to visualize the \u2206-variance. \n\n\n### Simulation studies \n  \nOur understanding of the importance of accounting for variability between biological replicates led us to ask whether failing to account for biological replication could lead to the appearance of false discoveries in the absence of a perturbation. To test this hypothesis, we simulated scRNA-seq data with no biological effect, in which we systematically varied the degree of heterogeneity between replicates. Simulations were performed using the \u2018Splatter\u2019 R package , with simulation parameters estimated from the Kang et al. dataset  using the \u2018splatEstimate\u2019 function. Populations of between 100 and 2,000 cells were simulated, with between 3 and 20 replicates per condition. DE of varying magnitudes was simulated between replicates by varying the location parameter of the DE factor log-normal distribution (\u2018de.facLoc\u2019) between 0 and 1, treating each replicate as its own group, and the total proportion of DE genes (\u2018de.prob\u2019) set to 0.5. Then, half of the replicates were randomly assigned to an artificial \u2018treatment\u2019 condition and the remaining half to a \u2018control\u2019 condition, and DE analysis was performed between the treatment and control groups. Except where otherwise noted, plots show results from a simulated population of 500 cells, with three replicates per condition. \n\n\n### Analysis of published scRNA-seq control groups \n  \nTo confirm that the trends observed in simulation studies were reflective of experimental datasets, we performed a similar analysis using published scRNA-seq data. Within our compendium, we identified a total of fourteen studies with control groups that included six or more samples . Details on the preprocessing of each of these datasets are provided below. For each of these studies, we split the control group randomly into artificial \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018treatment\u2019 groups, and performed DE analysis. In addition to computing the total number of DE genes, we identified GO terms enriched among DE genes using a hypergeometric test. We also performed a similar analysis for one spatial transcriptomics dataset24, identifying DE genes between random groups of control mice with barcodes grouped by spinal cord region rather than cell type. Spatial transcriptomics data was downloaded from the supporting website at  . Only data from wild-type mice was retained for the analysis. Last, we hypothesized that scRNA-seq studies of human tissues would display more heterogeneity between replicates than studies of animal models, where factors such as genotype, environment, and perturbation can be precisely controlled. To test this hypothesis, we computed the mean \u2206-variance across all genes in the 38 human or mouse scRNA-seq datasets in our compendium (n\u2009=\u200918 human datasets and 20 mouse datasets). \n\n\n### Application to spinal cord injury \n  \nTo demonstrate the relevance of our findings to the discovery of new biological mechanisms, we collected scRNA-seq data of the mouse lumbar spinal cord after SCI, and performed DE analysis. \n\n#### Animal model \n  \nExperiments were conducted on adult male or female C57BL/6 mice (15-35\u2009g body weight, 12-30 weeks of age). Vglut2:Cre (Jackson Laboratory 016963) transgenic mice were used and maintained on a mixed genetic background (129/C57BL/6). Housing, surgery, behavioral experiments and euthanasia were performed in compliance with the Swiss Veterinary Law guidelines. Animal care, including manual bladder voiding, was performed twice daily for the first 3 weeks after injury and once daily for the remaining post-injury period. All procedures and surgeries were approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland; GE/57/20\u2009A). \n\n\n#### Surgical procedures and post-surgical care \n  \nSurgical procedures were performed as previously described . Briefly, a laminectomy was made at the mid-thoracic level (T9 vertebra). We performed a contusion injury using a force-controlled spinal cord impactor (IH-0400 Impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation LLC, USA ), as previously described . The applied force was set to 90 kdyn. Analgesia (buprenorphine, Essex Chemie AG, Switzerland, 0.01\u20130.05\u2009mg per kg, s.c.) was provided for three days after surgery. \n\n\n#### Kinematic recordings \n  \nKinematic recordings were performed as previously described . Bilateral leg kinematics were captured using a 12-camera infrared (200\u2009Hz) Vicon high-speed motion capture system (Vicon Motion Systems, UK). We attached reflective markers bilaterally at the iliac crest, the greater trochanter (hip joint), the lateral condyle (knee joint), the lateral malleolus (ankle), and the distal end of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint. \n\n\n#### Kinematic analysis \n  \nFor each leg, 15 step cycles were extracted for each mouse. A total of 75 parameters quantifying kinematic and kinetic features were computed for each gait cycle accordingly. To evaluate differences between conditions we implemented a multistep statistical procedure based on principal component analysis, as previously described . \n\n\n#### Electrophysiology \n  \nMice were anaesthetised using a ketamine/xylazine anesthesia mixture. Stainless steel needle electrodes (30\u2009G) were inserted through the posterior surface of the ankle for nerve stimulation and into the lateral, plantar surface of the foot for digital electromyographic recordings. Responses were recorded at a stimulation intensity of 2 x threshold for evoking an H-wave. Signals were amplified and filtered (1000x and 300\u2009Hz\u20135\u2009kHz, AM Systems differential amplifier) then digitised (PowerLab, AD instruments) for acquisition. Twenty recordings were made at each of 5 different stimulation frequencies (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5\u2009Hz) with a one minute break between each frequency setting. Peak to peak amplitudes for at least three responses were measured for both M and H waves at each frequency, for each animal. Response amplitudes were first normalized to the amplitude of the M wave at each frequency, and then normalized to the H/M ratio at 0.1\u2009Hz for comparisons across animals. \n\n\n#### Single-nucleus RNA sequencing \n  \nSingle-nucleus dissociation of the mouse spinal cord was performed as previously described . Animals were first euthanized by isoflurane inhalation and cervical dislocation. The lumbar spinal cord site was rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice. Spinal cords were dounced in 500\u2009\u00b5l sucrose buffer (0.32\u2009M sucrose, 10\u2009mM HEPES [pH 8.0], 5\u2009mM CaCl , 3\u2009mM Mg acetate, 0.1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT) and 0.1% Triton X-100 with the Kontes Dounce Tissue Grinder. 2\u2009mL of sucrose buffer was added and filtered through a \u00b5m cell strainer. The lysate was centrifuged at 3200\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatant was decanted, and 3\u2009mL of sucrose buffer added to the pellet and incubated for 1\u2009min. The pellet was homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax and 12.5\u2009mL of density buffer (1\u2009M sucrose, 10\u2009mM HEPES [pH 8.0], 3\u2009mM Mg acetate, 1\u2009mM DTT) was added below the nuclei layer. The tube was centrifuged at 3200\u2009g at 4\u2009\u00b0C and supernatant poured off. Nuclei on the bottom half of the tube wall were collected with 100\u2009\u00b5l PBS with 0.04% BSA and 0.2 U/\u00b5l RNase inhibitor. Resuspended nuclei were filtered through a 30\u2009\u00b5m strainer, and adjusted to 1000 nuclei/\u00b5l. \n\n\n#### Library preparation \n  \nLibrary preparation was carried out using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit Version 2. The nuclei suspension was added to the Chromium RT mix to achieve loading numbers of 5,000. For downstream cDNA synthesis (13 PCR cycles), library preparation and sequencing, the manufacturer\u2019s instructions were followed. \n\n\n#### Read alignment \n  \nReads were aligned to the most recent Ensembl release (GRCm38.93) using Cell Ranger, and a matrix of unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts, including both intronic and exonic reads, was obtained using velocyto . Seurat  was then used to calculate quality control metrics for each cell barcode, including the number of genes detected, number of UMIs, and proportion of reads aligned to mitochondrial genes. Low-quality cells were filtered by removing cells expressing less than 200 genes or with more than 5% mitochondrial reads. Genes expressed in less than 3 cells were likewise removed, yielding a count matrix consisting of 22,806 genes and 19,237 cells. \n\n\n#### Clustering and integration \n  \nPrior to clustering analysis, we first performed batch effect correction and data integration across the two different experimental conditions as previously described . Gene expression data were normalized using regularized negative binomial models , then integrated across batches using the data integration workflow within Seurat. The normalized and integrated gene expression matrices were then subjected to clustering to identify cell types in the integrated dataset, again using the default Seurat workflow. Cell types were manually annotated on the basis of marker gene expression, guided by previous studies of the mouse spinal cord . \n\n\n#### Viral tract tracing \n  \nAll surgeries on mice were performed at EPFL under general anaesthesia with isoflurane in oxygen-enriched air using an operating microscope, and rodent stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf). We identified plasticity of excitatory neurons in the lumbar spinal cord after SCI using AAV-DJ-hSyn Flex mGFP 2\u2009A synaptophysin mRuby (Stanford Vector Core Facility, reference AAV DJ GVVC-AAV-100, titer 1.15E12 genome copies per ml ) injections on each side of the cord of Vglut2:Cre mice at the L6 spinal level, 0.25\u2009\u03bcl 0.6\u2009mm below the surface at 0.1\u2009\u03bcl per minute using glass micropipettes (ground to 50 to 100\u2009\u03bcm tips) connected via high-pressure tubing (Kopf) to 10-\u03bcl syringes under the control of microinfusion pumps. \n\n\n#### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nAfter terminal anaesthesia by barbiturate overdose, mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde and spinal cords processed for immunofluorescence as previously described . Primary antibodies were: rat anti-Pecam1 (BD Biosciences 550274, 1:200). Secondary antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 555 Goat Anti Rat (1:200, Life Technologies, A21434). Immunofluorescence was imaged digitally on a slide scanner [Olympus VS-120 Slide scanner] or confocal microscope [Zeiss LSM880\u2009+\u2009Airy fast module with ZEN 2 Black software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)]. Images were processed using ImageJ (NIH) or Imaris (Bitplane, version 9.0.0). \n\n\n#### Tissue clearing \n  \nMouse spinal cords were cleared using CLARITY  four weeks after injection of AAV-DJ-hSyn-flex-mGFP-2A-Synaptophysin-mRuby . Mice were perfused transcardially first with 0.1\u2009M PBS followed by 4% PFA (in 0.1\u2009M PBS, pH 7.4) at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The spinal cords were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA (in 0.1\u2009M PBS) for 24\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The dura was removed from the samples prior to clearing. Samples were incubated in A4P0 hydrogel solution (4% acrylamide in 0.001\u2009M PBS with 0.25% of the photoinitiator 2,2\u2032-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan)) for 24\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C with gentle nutation. Samples were degassed by bubbling nitrogen gas through the tube for 3\u2009m. Hydrogel polymerization was initiated by incubating the sample in a 37\u2009\u00b0C water bath for 2\u2009h. Tissue was washed in 0.001\u2009M PBS for 5\u2009m at room temperature. Samples were then placed in the X-CLARITY Tissue Clearing System I (Logos Biosystems Inc., South Korea) set to 1.2\u2009A, 100 RPM, 37\u2009\u00b0C. Clearing solution was made in-house from 40\u2009g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 200\u2009mM boric acid, and filled to a total volume of 1\u2009L with dH2O (pH adjusted to 8.5). Samples cleared after ~10\u201315\u2009h. The sample was then washed for at least 24\u2009h at room temperature with shaking in 1x PBS and 0.1% Triton-X (with 0.02% sodium azide) to remove excess SDS. The sample was then incubated in RIMS (40\u2009g of Histodenz dissolved in 30\u2009mL of 0.02\u2009M PB, pH 7.5, 0.01% sodium azide, refractive index 1.465) for at least 24\u2009h at room temperature with gentle shaking prior to imaging. Imaging was performed using a custom-built MesoSPIM  and CLARITY-optimized light-sheet microscope (COLM) as described . A customized sample holder was used to secure the spinal cords in a chamber filled with RIMS. Samples were imaged using a 2.5\u00d7 objective at the MesoSPIM and a 4x objective at the COLM with two lightsheets illuminating the sample from the left and the right sides. The pixel resolution was 2.6\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.6 \u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u03bcm for the 2,5x acquisition; and 1.4\u2009\u03bcm by 1.4\u2009\u03bcm by 5\u2009\u03bcm for the 4x acquisition in the x-, y-, and z-directions. Images were acquired as 16-bit TIFF files. 3D reconstructions of the raw images were produced using Arivis (v3.4) and Imaris softwares (Bitplane, v.9.0.0). \n\n\n#### RNAscope \n  \nTo corroborate the results suggested by DE analysis of scRNA-seq data, we analyzed the in situ co-localization of putatively DE genes and cell type marker genes using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) . Lists of putatively DE genes were obtained for representative single-cell and pseudobulk DE methods (the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and edgeR-LRT, respectively), and cross-referenced against a list of validated probes designed and provided by Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc. In total, probes were obtained for 13 genes identified as DE by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Sgms1, catalog no. 538561; Pcdh9, catalog no. 524921; Epas1, catalog no. 314371; Tcaf1, catalog no. 466921; Gspt1, catalog no. 530471; Prex2, catalog no. 432481; Sema7a, catalog no. 437261; Zfp366, catalog no. 443301; Cpe, catalog no. 454091; Afap1l2, catalog no. 556251; Nedd4l, catalog no. 491981; Adipor2, catalog no. 452861; Ptpn14, catalog no. 493181) and 7 genes identified by edgeR-LRT (Slc7a11, catalog no. 422511; Gjb2, catalog no. 518881; Pi16, catalog no. 451311; Rbp4, catalog no. 508501; Col1a1, catalog no. 319371; Igfbp6, catalog no. 425721). In addition, we obtained probes for Pecam1 (catalog no. 316721), a classic endothelial cell marker gene. We then obtained 16\u2009\u03bcm cryosections from fixed-frozen spinal cords as previously described  and performed staining for each probe according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using the RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit (cat. no. 323133). For each biological replicate (  n  \u2009=\u20094 per condition for both injured and uninjured mice), we analyzed ten cells positive for   Pecam1   and tallied the number of speckles for each gene of interest. The mean expression of each gene was then calculated for each biological replicate, and a one-tailed t-test was conducted based on the directional change in the snRNA-seq data. \n\n\n\n### Mixed models \n  \nHaving established that the performance of DE methods is contingent on their ability to account for biological replicates, we asked why mixed models failed to match the performance of pseudobulk methods. In addition to the linear mixed model described above, we implemented generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) based on the negative binomial or Poisson distributions, adapting implementations provided in the \u2018muscat\u2019 R package . For each of these models, we evaluated the impact of incorporating the library size factors as an offset term, and compared the Wald test of model coefficients to a likelihood ratio test against a reduced model, yielding a total of four GLMMs from each distribution. The enormous computational requirements of the GLMMs prevented us from evaluating these models in the full ground truth datasets; instead, we analyzed a series of downsampled datasets, each containing between 25 and 1,000 cells. To quantify the computational resources required by each DE method, we monitored peak memory usage using the \u2018peakRAM\u2019 R package, and the base R function \u2018system.time\u2019 to record wall time. \n\n\n### Preprocessing and analysis of published single-cell datasets \n  \nWe assembled a compendium of 46 published single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq studies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), and performed DE analyses across this compendium to establish the generality of our conclusions. For publications containing more than one comparison, only a single comparison was retained, as described in detail below. We retained the comparison involving the greatest number of cells, and used the most fine-grained cell type annotations provided by the authors of the original studies. When count matrices did not use gene symbols, the provided identifiers were mapped to gene symbols, and counts summed across genes mapping to identical symbols. Only cell types with at least three cells in each condition were subjected to DE analysis, and genes detected in less than three cells were removed. \n\n Angelidis et al., 2019  . scRNA-seq data from young and aged mouse lung (3\u2009m and 24\u2009m, respectively), as well as matching bulk data from two purified cell types, was obtained from GEO ( ).

L. and Hiendleder, Stefan and Williams, John L.\nBMC Genomics, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nNew insights into mammalian sex chromosome structure and evolution using high-quality sequences from bovine X and Y chromosomes\n\n# Keywords\n\nGenomes\nLivestock\nBovine\nSex chromosomes\nPseudoautosomal region\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nMammalian X chromosomes are mainly euchromatic with a similar size and structure among species whereas Y chromosomes are smaller, have undergone substantial evolutionary changes and accumulated male specific genes and genes involved in sex determination. The\u00a0pseudoautosomal region (PAR) is conserved on the X and Y and pair during meiosis. The structure, evolution and function of mammalian sex chromosomes, particularly the Y chromsome, is still poorly understood because few species have high quality sex chromosome assemblies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nHere we report the first bovine sex chromosome assemblies that include the complete PAR spanning 6.84\u2009Mb and three Y chromosome X-degenerate (X-d) regions. The PAR comprises 31 genes, including genes that are missing from the X chromosome in current cattle, sheep and goat reference genomes. Twenty-nine PAR genes are single-copy genes and two are multi-copy gene families, OBP, which has 3 copies and BDA20, which has 4 copies. The Y chromosome X-d1, 2a and 2b regions contain 11, 2 and 2 gametologs, respectively. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe ruminant PAR comprises 31 genes and is similar to the PAR of pig and dog but extends further than those of human and horse. Differences in the pseudoautosomal boundaries are consistent with evolutionary divergence times. A bovidae-specific expansion of members of the lipocalin gene family in the PAR reported here, may affect immune-modulation and anti-inflammatory responses in ruminants. Comparison of the X-d regions of Y chromosomes across species revealed that five of the X-Y gametologs, which are known to be global regulators of gene activity and candidate sexual dimorphism genes, are conserved. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe sex chromosomes evolved from ancestral autosomes in dioecious lineages and have become extensively differentiated in structure and gene content [ ,  ]. Mammalian X chromosomes are mainly euchromatic with a similar size and structure among species, and have retained most of the ancestral X genes [ ,  ]. In contrast, Y chromosomes have undergone substantial evolutionary changes, accumulated male specific genes and genes involved in sex determination, and have lost 95% of the ancestral genes [ ]. As a consequence, the Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome and comprises mainly the pseudoautosomal (PAR), X-degenerate (X-d) and ampliconic regions [ ]. \n\nThe PAR is conserved on the X and Y, pairing and recombining at meiosis [ ]. Most mammals have a single PAR region but the human sex chromosomes are an exception with a second PAR at the distal ends of the X and Y chromosomes [ ]. The PAR plays an essential role in normal sexual development and loss of the PAR is associated with male sterility in humans [ ]. Despite its critical role in fertility and disease, the PAR is one of the least well-characterised parts of most mammalian genomes. Previous studies have described the genes at the bovine pseudoautosomal boundary and PAR gene content [ \u2013 ], but currently there is neither a complete gene map nor a precise size available for the bovine PAR. \n\nThe X-d regions of the Y chromosome contain single-copy genes, pseudogenes, which appear to be surviving relics of the autosomes from which the Y chromosome evolved, and ampliconic regions, which consist of large heterochromatic blocks rich in repetitive sequences [ ,  ,  ]. Both the X-d and ampliconic regions are male-specific. Unlike the highly conserved PAR, the structure and gene content of the X-d regions differ among mammalian species. The human X-d regions are interrupted by several large blocks of ampliconic sequences, while the X-d regions of chimpanzee include a single ampliconic block [ ,  ]. A study of bovine Y chromosome gene expression has contributed information on genes in X-d regions [ ], but interpretation of the data is limited by the relatively poor quality of the available Y chromosome assembly. \n\nThe complex and highly repetitive Y ampliconic regions are difficult to assemble, particularly from short sequence reads. Many mammalian genome sequencing projects have used a female subject to avoid having to resolve X and Y haplotypes, and therefore do not include the Y chromosome. Only a few species, including human [ ], chimpanzee [ ], rhesus macaque [ ], mouse [ ], pig [ ] and horse [ ], have well characterised and assembled Y chromosomes. \n\nThe   Bos taurus taurus   reference genome assembly Btau_5.0.1 [ ] (NCBI Project ID:20275) was assembled from short and long sequence reads of BAC clones and contains a Y chromosome sequence. A   Bos taurus indicus   Y chromosome was created by alignment of short read sequences to Btau_4.0 [ ], and therefore will be missing any larger indicine-specific features. These sex chromosome assemblies are incomplete and inconsistent, hindering studies on sex chromosome evolution and the dissection of the molecular architecture of sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits. \n\nIn the present article, we report high quality assemblies of bovine X and Y chromosomes, created from long read sequences and optical mapping data, using a trio binning approach [ ] that exploited the high level of DNA sequence divergence between the two subspecies of domestic cattle [ \u2013 ],   Bos taurus taurus   and   Bos taurus indicus  . We present a detailed gene map of the complete bovine PAR and X-d regions from these assemblies and discuss the evolutionary changes and functional aspects in these regions in comparison with other mammals. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Assembly and annotation of the cattle sex chromosomes \n  \nThe bovine X and Y chromosomes were assembled from whole genome sequence of a hybrid male with a   Bos taurus taurus   (Angus) sire and a   Bos taurus indicus   (Brahman) dam [ ] (see URLs). The assembled chromosomes presented here are the Brahman X chromosome which comprises 146\u2009Mb in 106 contigs with 983 genes, and the Angus Y chromosome which comprises 16\u2009Mb in 67 contigs with 51 unique genes (Table\u00a0  and Additional file  : Table S1). These sequence assemblies have been deposited at NCBI (X: CM0011833.1; Y: CM0011803.1). The full length of the cattle Y chromosome has been estimated as ~\u200950\u2009Mb, at least half of which is in the highly repetitive region [ ]. As in other species [ ,  ,  ], even with long read sequencing, we could not assemble the ampliconic highly repetitive region [ ]\u00a0or the heterochromatic regions. Full annotation of the Brahman X and Angus Y chromosomes are available from Ensembl release v97 (UOA_Brhaman_1 and UOA_Angus_1). Analysis of the PAR and X-degenerate regions are presented below.\n   \nLength and number of gaps for Mammalian Sex chromosomes \n  \n\n\n### Identification of the cattle PAR \n  \nAlignment of assembled Brahman X and Angus Y chromosomes to each other identified a 6.8\u2009Mb region with 99% sequence identity that extends from the start of the assembled X chromosome sequence (CM0011833.1) to 2933\u2009bp distal to   GPR143  , after which sequence identity decreases to 86% for 348\u2009bp and then drops abruptly to ~\u200915% for the next 1\u2009Mb (Fig.\u00a0 ). The X chromosome PAR is assembled in one contig while the Y chromosome PAR only has two contig gaps. This enabled us to precisely define the PAR boundary and size. The PAR on the Brahman X and Angus Y chromosomes contained 31 genes in the same order. Of these, 29 are single-copy genes and two are multi-copy gene families,   OBP  , which has 3 copies and   BDA20,   which has 4 copies (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table\u00a0S4). The Brahman X chromosome PAR contains 12 genes that are missing from the proximal end of the X chromosome in the current Hereford reference genome ARS-UCD1.2 (Additional file  : Table S3).\n   \nComparison of the Brahman X and Angus Y cattle chromosome pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) and adjacent sequence. The x-axis is Angus Y chromosome and y-axis is Brahman X chromosome. The cattle PAR is located between   PLCXD1   and   GPR143  , 3286\u2009bp distal to   GPR143  . The X and Y chromosome PAR genes (dark blue) share the same gene content and gene order. Gene families   OBP   and   BDA20   are highlighted in yellow and orange. The X chromosome PAR is assembled in one contig while the Y chromosome PAR has two contig gaps.   SHROOM2   is located distal to the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) on the X chromosome, which is found inverted on the Y chromosome X-d1 region \n  \n\n\n### Identification of cattle X-degenerate regions \n  \nAdditional genes outside the PAR showed between 60 and 96% sequence identity between the X and Y chromosomes and are located in X-degenerate regions of the Y chromosome. The first of these regions, X-d1, is located distal to the PAR and spans 1.48\u2009Mb, between 6.84\u2009Mb and 8.32\u2009Mb. X-d1 contains 11 single-copy protein coding genes. The corresponding region on the X chromosome spans 35\u2009Mb. and contains 10 X-d1 homologues in a different order but misses RPL23AY, which is located on chromosome 19 (Fig.\u00a0 ). A 3\u2009Mb ampliconic region immediately distal to X-d1 contains the male-specific Y (MSY) gene families   PRAMEY  ,   TSPY  , and   HSFY.   At the distal end of the ampliconic region, the second X-degenerate region, X-d2a, spans 1.63\u2009Mb and contains two single copy genes,   UBE1Y   and   TXLNGY  . The X chromosome homologs of these two genes are separated by a 44\u2009Mb interval that contains 285 X chromosome-specific genes. Distal to X-d2a lies a 4.5\u2009Mb ampliconic segment containing the bovine specific MSY genes ZNF280AY and ZNF280BY, which are equivalent to TSPY and HSFY found in other species. The copy numbers of multi-copy MSY gene families are listed in Additional file  : Table S2 and the complex arrangement of multi-copy genes is presented in Additional file  : Figure S3. The distal end of chromosome Y contains the third X-degenerate region, X-d2b, which extends over 1.3\u2009Mb and includes SRY and two copies of RBMY. The X chromosome homologs of these,   SOX3   and   RBMX  , are located in a 5\u2009Mb segment at the distal end of the X chromosome.\n   \nA gene map of X-Y homologous genes outside the cattle PAR. X-degenerate (X-d1, Xd2a and X-d2b) and ampliconic regions are indicated. 14 X-Y paired genes and 6 multi-copy genes are shown. Of 11 genes located in X-d1 (light blue), all but   RPL23AY   have homologous on the chromosome 19. Gene orientations are not consistent for X-Y paired genes. Multi-copy genes (yellow) and bovine-specific Y genes (asterisk) are indicated \n  \n\n\n### Comparison of sex chromosome structure in mammals \n  \nAlignment of the Brahman X chromosome with the current   Bos taurus taurus   (Hereford) cattle reference sequence (ARS-UCD1.2) revealed a 4\u2009Mb inversion as a major structural difference. In both assemblies this inverted region ends at contig breakpoints (Additional file  : Figure S1a). Alignment of the Brahman X chromosome with the water buffalo X chromosome [ ] revealed a high level of co-linearity, with one large inversion and five small inversions at the distal end of the chromosome (Additional file  : Figure S1b). The Brahman and water buffalo X chromosomes are 30 and 25\u2009Mb longer, respectively, than the goat X chromosome, which consists of two scaffolds with a combined length of 116\u2009Mb [ ]. The goat X chromosome shows excellent co-linearity overall with the sheep X chromosome (Additional file  : Figure S1c-d) but both showed numerous break points and several inversions, particularly on the short arm, in comparison with the Brahman and water buffalo X chromosomes. Non-ruminant mammalian X chromosomes, i.e. human, pig, dog and horse, revealed a striking similarity in the pattern of rearrangements in comparison to the   Bos taurus indicus   (Brahman) X chromosome (Additional file  : Figure S1e-h). These consisted predominantly of 5 large inversions. \n\nAlignment of the Angus Y chromosome assembly with pig, horse and human Y chromosomes showed limited co-linearity which was confined to the PAR and X-degenerate regions (Additional file  : Figure S2a-c). \n\n\n### Gene content and order of the mammalian PAR \n  \nThere is a very high level of conservation of synteny among mammalian PARs (Fig.\u00a0 ). PLCXD1 is the most proximal PAR gene in human, horse, Brahman cattle and water buffalo. At their proximal ends, the PAR regions in the Hereford cattle reference genome, and sheep, goat and pig assemblies are truncated distal to   DHRSX  ,   CLRF2  ,   CD99   and   GYG2   respectively (Additional file  : Table S3). At their distal end, the pig and dog PAR extend beyond   GPR143   with a boundary distal to SHROOM2. In comparison to all the other species, the goat PAR has an inversion of three genes (  TBL1X  ,   GPR143  ,   SHROOM2  ) close to the ruminant PAR boundary. This region is contained in one contig of the goat assembly and may thus be a contig orientation error, rather than a goat-specific rearrangement. The human sex chromosomes are an exception amongst mammals and have PARs at the proximal and distal ends [ ]. The PAR1 in human is equivalent to the single PAR of other mammalian species, but is much shorter, with a distal boundary proximal to   XG  . The PAR of horse is the shortest with the distal boundary at   PRKX   (Fig.  ).\n   \nComparison of the X chromosome PAR genes in cattle and other mammals. PAR genes (dark blue) and X specific genes (light blue) are indicated for each species. Red dashed lines represent genes with different order relative to the Brahman cattle. The pseudoautosomal boundary gene is the same in all ruminants except goat which has an inversion. Copy number of   OBP   and   BDA20   varies among species. The copy number of OBP and BDA20 are listed in Additional file  : Table S4.   BDA20   is ruminant specific whereas   OBP   is found in all mammals except human. Assemblies for pig, Hereford cattle, sheep and goat show a truncated PAR. The numbers above each species name represent the approximate PAR size \n  \n\n\n### PAR gene family expansions in different lineages \n  \nThe   OBP   gene family, which is distal to   PRKX   in all species, is within the PAR of all ruminants, pig and dog, but is outside the PAR of horse, and is missing from the human X chromosome. This gene family is expanded in ruminants (Fig.  ). The   BDA20   gene family is immediately distal to the OBP family and present in all ruminants for which data are available, including Yak [ ], Deer [ ] and Chiru [ ], but is not found in other mammals (Fig.  ). The   BDA20   family shows differential expansion in the different ruminant species, with two or more copies with 74\u201391% nucleotide sequence identity at mRNA level in cattle [ ], sheep [ ], goat [ ] and buffalo [ ] (Fig.  , Additional file  : Table S4). In contrast,   ARSF  , a member of the ARS family, has been reported as a PAR gene in other mammalian species, but is not found in any of the ruminant PARs [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Comparison of X-degenerate Y chromosome regions \n  \nMost of the X-Y paired genes of cattle, pig and horse that are outside the PAR are found in the X degenerate region, X-d1, located adjacent to the PAR (Fig.\u00a0 ). Of the 11 genes in the cattle X-d1 region 8 are in common with horse and pig X-d1 regions, but the gene order differs between the three species.   RPL23AY   is only found in the cow X-d1, while   TMSB4Y   is found in the horse and pig X -d1 regions and the human X-d3 region which is\u00a0missing from cow X-d regions. Five additional bovine gametologs are found in two X-d2 regions, X-d2a and X-d2b, which correspond to the single X-d2 in horse and pig. Cattle X-d2a is distal to X-d1 and contains 2 genes,   UBE1Y   and   TXLNGY  . Both genes are found in the pig X-d2 region but   UBE1Y   is in an ampliconic region of the horse Y chromosome. The cattle X-d2b region contains SRY and is in a telomeric position similar to the X-d2 region of pig. The cattle X-d2b region contains two copies of   RBMY  , which is also duplicated in the horse X-d2 [ ].\n   \nComparison of Y chromosome X-degenerate regions in cattle and other mammals. The human Y chromosome is different from other mammals with 7 X-d regions and one unique X-transposed region (pink). Eight X-d1 genes are shared among cattle, pig and horse but the gene order and orientation are not the same. The cattle X-d2 is split into and X-d2a X-d2b regions with 2 and 3 genes respectively. The cattle Y chromosome diagram does not include the unknown heterochromatic regions \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe trio-binning approach facilitated the construction of the most complete bovine X and Y chromosome sequence assemblies available to date. Alignment of the Brahman cattle X with Hereford X revealed a major inverted region. In both assemblies this inverted region ends at contig breakpoints and could be an assembly artefact rather than a true biological difference. We could not resolve this discrepancy using RH and linkage maps [ \u2013 ] because the marker density was insufficient. Alignments of the Brahman cattle X chromosome with those of the water buffalo, goat and sheep, revealed a high level of co-linearity, but with numerous break points and several inversions. Many of these structural differences are consistent with gross karyotypic rearrangements that differentiate goat and sheep X chromosomes from those of cattle and water buffalo [ ]. The evolutionary separation of goat and sheep from cattle and buffalo occurred 20\u201325 MYBP, which pre-dates the separation of goat and sheep from each other, 10\u201315 MYBP, and of buffalo from cattle, about 12 MYBP [ ]. This evolutionary history is consistent with the differences in X chromosome structure we see among these species [ ,  ]. \n\nThe X chromosomes of human, pig, dog and horse have a strikingly similar pattern of differences relative to the Brahman cattle X chromosome. Ruminants are even-toed ungulates which separated from odd-toed ungulates (including the pig and horse) more than 60 MYBP, suggesting that the rearrangements occurred after this split but prior to the separation of the ruminants, about 25 MYBP [ ]. \n\nComparison of the Brahman cattle X chromosome with other mammalian reference genomes suggest the X chromosome assemblies for the Hereford cattle, sheep, goat and pig are incomplete at the proximal end of the PAR. The proximal PAR genes of Brahman cattle, water buffalo, human and horse are the same. Genes missing from the proximal end of the Hereford cattle X chromosome have been misplaced on various autosomes, whereas the genes missing from sheep, goat and pig, are found on unplaced contigs. Given that the common ancestor of cattle, water buffalo, human and horse existed about 96 MYBP, it is more parsimonious to suggest the gene order and structure of the proximal PAR are conserved and not assembly artefacts. The assembly of the Brahman cattle and water buffalo [ ] X chromosomes may have benefited from the use of much longer PacBio reads and improved assembly algorithms. \n\nThe distal PAR boundary in ancient species is thought to lie within the   AMEL   locus [ ]. However, there was no substantial identity of the Brahman X and Angus Y chromosomes for the region between 2933\u2009bp distal to   GPR143   and   AMELX  . The PAR boundary in cattle is therefore just distal to   GPR143  . The distal ends of the PARs of water buffalo and sheep also lie close to   GRP143.  \n\nThe expansion of   OBP   and   BDA20   gene families in ruminants suggests they have a specific role in these species. These genes are members of the lipocalin family which are involved in immune-modulation and anti-inflammatory responses [ ]. For example, their expression changes after exposure of cattle to ticks [ ]. The ARS gene family in the ruminant PAR is missing   ARSF   that is found in non-ruminant species, suggesting that it has been lost during ruminant evolution. \n\nRecombination of mammalian sex chromosomes only occurs in the PAR. This may explain why the MSY regions are rich in repetitive sequences [ ,  ]. The co-linearity between Angus and Hereford Y chromosomes is limited to X-d and   PRAMEY   regions, while the numerous repetitive sequences in ampliconic regions appear expanded in the Hereford Y. This may be due to the use of various BAC clones from several individuals to assemble the Hereford Y chromosome [ ]. The Angus Y chromosome assembly shows some alignment in some isolated areas with pig, horse and human Y chromosomes, which is\u00a0mainly in X-degenerate and ampliconic regions. This is consistent with rapid evolution of non-recombining Y chromosome sequences [ ]. \n\nWe identified 16 X-Y paired genes in 3 X-degenerate regions on the Angus Y chromosome, which were interspersed by ampliconic regions that contain multiple copies of bovine-specific   PRAMEY, ZNF280AY   and   ZNF280BY   genes.   PRAMEY   genes are exclusively expressed in testis and are involved in spermatogenesis during testicular maturation [ ]. ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY are multi-copy Y-genes transposed from an autosome. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of these genes also suggests that they play a role in spermatogenesis [ ]. While horse, pig and cattle X-d1 are similar in gene content, gene order is very different in the three species.   RPL23AY   is cattle-specific and a second copy of this gene,   RPL23A  , is found on chromosome 19, located in a conserved block in mammals with intron-exon structure and six identical intron-less pseudogenes with 91% sequence identity to this gene are found on cattle chromosomes 3, 9, 10, 14, 22 and 29, suggesting that these copies have arisen by retrotransposition. \n\nCattle have lost several ancestral Y genes from X-d regions including   KD5MD  ,   TMSB4Y   and   TXLNGY  . Ten of the 16 gametologs are conserved in the X-d regions of horse, 8 in pig and 5 in human. The genes in the X-d regions, do not recombine, and hence diverge over time, allowing for the possibility of sex-specific selection. They may therefore be involved in sexual dimorphism [ ]. Five of these (  DDX3Y  ,   EIF1AY  ,   USP9Y  ,   UTY  ,   ZFY  ) are global regulators of gene activity expressed across a broad range of adult tissues and could have profound effects on sexual development [ ]. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe quality of assemblies achieved for the X chromosome, and for the PAR, X-d and ampliconic regions of the Y chromosome, using the trio-binning approach, enabled us to examine and compare major structures of the bovine sex chromosomes, both between the sex chromosomes and among species. Alignment of the Brahman X and Angus Y chromosomes precisely identified boundaries and gene content of the PAR region and indicated that the proximal end of the PAR is truncated in the sheep, goat and current bovine reference genome assemblies. The sequence data revealed expansions of gene families in the ruminant PAR region that have previously been associated with immune function, and conservation of gametologs that are known dosage sensitive regulators of gene expression. The sex chromosome assemblies and the annotation presented are valuable resources for the molecular characterization of sex-specific phenotype in livestock and other species. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Sample collection \n  \nAll animal work was approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (No. S-094-2005). Briefly, a Brahman cow was bought by the University of Adelaide from a farm (Kiowa, Kingstown, New South Wales) and was transported to SARDI experimental farm at Struan South Australia where it was inseminated with semen of an Angus bull bought by the University from American Breeder Services, Australia. At day 153 post-insemination, the cow was humanely killed by stunning and exsanguination at a commercial abattoir (Dalriada Abattoir, Keith, South Australia) as per standard operating procedures. The uterus was recovered and the male fetus removed and immediately humanely killed by stunning and exsanguination. Lung tissue was collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Details of the contig creation for this assembly using the trio binning method have been previously described [ ]. Briefly, DNA was extracted from fetal lung, paternal semen, and maternal uterine tissue. Long-read libraries of the fetus were prepared for sequencing on the Sequel platform as suggested by the manufacturer (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Short-read libraries of the sire and dam were prepared for sequencing on the NextSeq500 platform as recommended by the manufacturer (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA). Approximately 60x short-read coverage of the dam and sire were produced, and 134x long-read coverage for the fetus. Parent-specific kmers were identified, long reads sorted into bins by parental origin, and independent haploid assemblies constructed using triocanu (implemented in Canu v1.7). \n\n\n### Sex chromosomes assembly and validation \n  \nHaplotype resolved paternal and maternal contigs constructed using Canu [ ] were scaffolded independently using Hi-C reads [ ] and an optical map (Bionano tools v1.3.0), which were then consolidated into chromosome specific groups of scaffolds and the sex chromosome scaffolds selected for the male and female assembly. The high density of repetitive elements on both the X and Y chromosomes made assembly difficult, breaking sequence contiguity even with long sequence reads, so additional markers were used to validate the order and orientation of scaffolds. For the X chromosome, the USDA-MARC Bovine linkage Map [ ], and two RH maps, the BovGen RH map [ ] and SUNbRH7000-rad map [ ] were used to place, order and orientate scaffolds. For the Y chromosome, known genes in cattle [ ,  ], pig (Sscrofa11.1) and human (GRCh38.p12) assemblies were used to identify Y-specific scaffolds. Cattle Y chromosome RH map markers [ ] were used to guide ordering and orientation of the Y-specific scaffolds. To exclude scaffolds incorrectly identified as Y sequence, 26 scaffolds which were shorter than 50\u2009kb and contained fewer than three known Y genes, were manually inspected. These shorter scaffolds were partitioned into 50-kb bins and aligned with the CHORI-240 Bovine BAC library Y specific clones (see URLs) using BLASTN. Six sequences with less 90% alignment were removed. Further details on X and Y chromosomes scaffolds identification and orientation is given in Additional file  : Note 1 and 2, respectively. \n\n\n### Conflict resolution \n  \nThe RH X chromosome marker order and orientation was generally in agreement with the X chromosome assembly. However, 15 out of 84 markers from the BovGen RH map and 18 out of 93 markers from the SUNbRH7000-rad map suggested a possible assembly error. Comparison of the RH maps showed that 5 markers from BovGen RH map and 4 markers from SUNbRH7000-rad map had a consistent arrangement that differed from the Brahman X assembly. Both RH maps showed an inversion of a 1,286,607\u2009bp contig in a scaffold that is made up of 4 contigs. With the exception of this scaffold, other RH marker inconsistencies would have required contigs to be broken and rearranged. The Brahman X and ARS-UCD1.2 X agreed in all these regions so the order and orientation of scaffolds that agreed best with Hi-C and optical map was retained. \n\nOutside of the PAR, the Y chromosome assembly is made up of small scaffolds with average length of 98,509\u2009bp. The ordering of scaffolds was completely dependent on the 52 RH markers and no contig breaks were required. \n\n\n### X and Y chromosome alignments \n  \nIn order to compare intra- and inter-species sex chromosomes differences, pairwise alignments were carried out for cattle (Brahman, Angus, Hereford, Nelore), water buffalo, goat, sheep, human, pig, dog and horse using the aligner Lastz v1.04 [ ] with default settings. Brahman X is reverse complement to Hereford X. Prior to alignments, the Hereford X and Nelore X are reverse orientated for comparison. Repeats in the X and Y chromosomes were masked by Repeatmasker v4\u20130-7 using cow RepBase23.08 [ ]. The number of gaps was calculated using a custom python script. The number of inversions were calculated by Smash with a 1\u2009Mb block size [ ]. Further details on the alignment parameters is given in Additional file  : Note 3. \n\n\n### X and Y chromosome gene annotations \n  \nAll X chromosome genes from ARS-UCD1.2 were remapped to the Brahman X chromosome using the Exonerate v2.4 software [ ]. For the PAR, detailed manual annotation was carried out. A total of 42 protein-coding PAR genes were used to annotate the X chromosome. These genes came from the following sources: 1) 15 human PAR1 genes [ ]; 2) 22 candidate cattle PAR genes [ ]; 3) horse [ ], dog [ ] and pig [ ] PAR genes. A cattle PAR gene, arylsulfatase E (  ARSE  ), was reported in a FISH mapping study [ ] but the sequence is not available from NCBI. However, three other arylsulfatases paralogs on the X chromosome were available and were used to search for other similar members on the PAR. \n\nThe current cattle reference genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2 does not have a Y chromosome, therefore 18 Y-specific genes from the X-degenerate regions were selected from a study of Y chromosome transcribed sequences [ ], in addition, MSY genes from pig and human Y chromosomes were used for the Angus Y chromosome annotation. Further details on gene annotation are given in Additional file  : Note 4 and Additional file  : Table S1. \n\n\n### Conservation of synteny in mammalian PARs \n  \nEach of the X and Y chromosomes PARs were contained in single scaffold. To estimate the boundary of PAR, X and Y scaffolds containing PARs were partitioned into 1\u2009Mb windows and aligned against each other using BLASTN. From the alignments, the first bin from the proximal end that had coverage below 80% and percentage identity below 80% was identified as the pseudoautosomal boundary. The gene order of PAR genes between closely related species was analysed using Bioconductor Gviz plots [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6923926, "text_md5": "99adff0c4fff54cf60b2df2cf5dcfff7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 234], "journal": [235, 247], "publication_year": [249, 253], "title": [264, 391], "keywords": [405, 469], "abstract": [482, 2202], "body": [2211, 30336]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31856728, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-019-6364-z", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923926", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6923926"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923926\">6923926</a>", "list_title": "PMC6923926  New insights into mammalian sex chromosome structure and evolution using high-quality sequences from bovine X and Y chromosomes"}

The integrated epigenetic mechanisms were explored, specifically, germ cell differentiation experiences through a highly orchestrated process that involves multiple epigenetic events, which would give a clue for curing male infertility in animals and humans. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGerm cells are the only cell type capable of transmitting genetic information to the next generation. In many species, germ cells form at the fringe of the embryo proper and then traverse through several developing somatic tissues on their migration to the emerging gonads. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the only cells in developing embryos with the potential to transmit genetic information to the next generation ( ). Chicken PGCs, unlike mammals, exhibit unique migration activity, appearing within the epiblast in the blastoderm and moving to the hypoblast of the area pellucida instead of moving into embryonic gonads through the hindgut ( ). During gastrulation, chicken PGCs move to the germinal crescent, then circulate through the blood vessels, finally settling in the gonadal ridge ( ). In addition, chicken embryonic development occurs   in ovo   rather than   in utero   ( ). These unique characteristics of chicken germ cells during early development make germ cell isolation easier and make it possible to gain a huge number of cells from chicken embryos to advance stem cell research ( ). Therefore, chicken models play a pivotal role in animal research as an alternative and outbreed experimental species to humans to compensate for ethical constraints and the accessibility of human germ cell studies, and understanding germ cell biology   in\u00a0vivo   and   in\u00a0vitro   in chicken models would be important for practical applications of avian reproductive biology and endogenous species conversation, especially for human medicine, including various birth defects, germ cell tumors, and drug target screening ( ). \n\nDNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism in developmental biology and plays important roles in sex chromosome dosage compensation, the maintenance of genome stability, and the coordinated expression of imprinted genes ( ). PGCs, the precursors of sperm and eggs, are the route to totipotency and require the establishment of a unique epigenome in this lineage ( ). In vertebrates, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively on CpG islands (CGIs). Such methylation can be inherited through cell division and transmitted from one generation to the next via germ cells. CGI methylation plays a role in the maintenance of heterochromatin as well as the inhibition of promoter activity by inhibiting the interaction between transcriptional factors (TFs) and their promoters or by changing the chromatin structure ( ). In general, TFs orchestrate the overall remodeling of the epigenome, including the priming of loci that will change expression only at late stages of embryo development ( ). Besides, TF binding sites are overlapping with regions of dynamic changes in DNA methylation and are linked to its targeted regulation ( ). It has also been shown that lineage-specific TFs and signaling pathways collaborate with the core regulators of pluripotency to exit the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state and activate the transcriptional networks governing cellular specification ( ). \n\nNotably, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators. lncRNAs exhibit several distinctive features that confer unique regulatory functions, including exquisite cell- and the tissue-specific expression and the capacity to transduce higher-order spatial information. Some lncRNAs were reported to be under control of pluripotency factors such as OCT4 and NANOG. Interestingly, these lncRNAs seemingly activate the transcription of pluripotent TFs in\u00a0a regulatory positive feedback loop ( ). In addition, the global DNA demethylation is associated with a cascade of chromatin-remodeling events, including the transient loss of linker histone H1, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3, and stable loss of H3K9ac and H2A/H4 R3me2, and, subsequently, reactivation of the X chromosome in females ( ,  ). During spermatogenesis, methylation of histone tails is achieved by H3-K4, and H3-K9 methyltransferases ( ). Although histone modification patterns during spermatogenesis and the interactions with DNA methylation have been reported to perform specific roles ( ,  ), the orchestra among DNA methylation, TFs, lncRNAs, and histone modifications governing cellular specification during spermatogenesis is as yet poorly understood. \n\nRecent evidence suggests that the DNA methylation pattern in the chicken is similar to that in mammals ( ), and DNA methylation and histone modifications are also involved in the pluripotency maintenance and differentiation process of chick embryonic germ cells ( ). Moreover, DNA methylation and histone modifications are expressed in time- and tissue-dependent manners in developing chick embryos, and epigenetic marks are relatively stable and kept at lower levels after birth ( ,  ). Also, differentially methylated signatures associated with gene expression were detected in PGCs during the early embryonic development of chickens ( ). However, the precise and composited methylation regulation patterns, non-coding RNAs and TFs remain rarely studied in chick embryonic development. In this study, therefore, we aimed to explore precise DNA methylation regulation patterns during germline stem cell differentiation, especially differentiating into male germ cells, using methyl-CpG binding domain protein sequencing (MBD-seq) approach. The three kinds of chick germ cells\u2014ESCs, PGCs, and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)\u2013\u2013were collected to study epigenetic regulation mechanisms during spermatogenesis. Our results provided the comprehensive insight into epigenetic regulations during chicken spermatogenesis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Dynamics of DNA Methylation during Germ Cell Differentiation \n  \nTo study DNA methylation dynamics in chick spermatogenesis, we performed DNA methylation sequencing on genome-wide by MBD-seq for ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs isolated from stage X blastoderm chick gonad at embryonic day 5 (E5), and chick testis at E19, respectively ( A and 1B). Our results showed that ESCs have the lowest methylation level ( C), which was consistent with\u00a0genome-wide loss of DNA methylation during early mouse development, reaching a low point during the blastocyst stage ( ). PGCs have a higher level of genome-wide methylation than ESCs and SSCs during chick germ cell differentiation. To investigate DNA methylation in different genomic regions across three cell types, we profiled DNA methylation plots covering upstream 20 kb, gene body region, and downstream 20 kb for all annotated chicken genes ( A). We observed that ESCs had a lower methylation level than PGCs and SSCs from outside of upstream 5 kb and downstream 5 kb, but a sharp increase occurred in gene body regions and around the transcriptional start and end sites (TSSs and TESs) for ESCs.   \nDNA Methylation Dynamics during Chick Germ Cell Differentiation \n\n(A) ESCs were isolated from the blastoderm of fertile eggs at stage X, PGCs were isolated from chicken gonad at E5, and SSCs were isolated from chicken testis at E19. \n\n(B) The immunocytochemical detection of chick ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs with three independent experiments. The ESC marker OCT4, PGC marker CVH, and SSC marker integrin \u03b16 were DAPI staining and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. \n\n(C) DNA methylation trend through different development stages of chick germ cells. The numbers of DNA methylation peaks on three cell types (the left y axis) and the total length of DNA methylation peaks for each cell types (bp, the right y axis) are shown. DNA-methylated fragment sequencing analyses were performed with two biological replicates per cell type. \n\n(D) Enrichment score of DNA methylation in various annotated functional elements through three cell types. CGI is corresponding to the right y axis. The asterisks indicate statistically significant enrichment:  p\u00a0< 0.05,  p\u00a0< 0.01, Fisher's exact test) (see  ). \n  \n\nTo refine gene body regions and explore DNA methylation changes in different functional elements, we divided chicken genome into the promoter, exon, intron, and intergenic region plus CGI. The results demonstrated that a\u00a0large proportion of genomic methylation occurred on\u00a0CGIs, which had five times methylation enrichment compared with the exon regions indicated in  D (p\u00a0< 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Promoter regions were also enriched with abundant DNA methylation, which may be due to the fact that most annotated gene promoters overlap with a CGI ( ). It is noted that PGCs had significantly higher methylation than ESCs and SSCs across all these five functional elements, which was in agreement with  C, which shows that PGCs were experiencing   de novo   methylation and would last until male germ cells. In addition, some differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among three cell types were validated by bisulfite cloning sequencing, and the results indicated that 89% putative DMRs identified by MBD-seq were confirmed ( B). \n\n\n### DNA Methylation and Gene Expression during Germ Cell Differentiation \n  \nTo detect DNA methylation regulation of gene expression during germ cell differentiation, we examined differentially expressed genes between every two cell types and checked their DNA methylation levels in promoter regions. Interestingly, of 916 unique differentially expressed genes between ESCs and PGCs, 4.48% of genes are located on chromosome Z, and in which 65.85% of them were downregulated from ESCs into PGCs; however, when PGCs were differentiated into SSCs, 7.02% of 726 unique differentially expressed genes are located on chromosome Z and 82.35% of them were upregulated ( A). These results demonstrated that most of the sex chromosome genes were activated at the second stage to drive sexual differentiation, which conformed to the biological characteristics of cell differentiation phenotype. The results of DNA methylation enrichment on promoter regions of unique differentially expressed genes showed that, in general, mRNA expression of genes and their DNA methylation of promoter regions had opposite expression directions, confirming that DNA methylation represses gene transcription. From PGCs to SSCs, their mRNA expression in ESCs was similar to that in PGCs or SSCs, which was with low mRNA expression in general ( B); thus, DNA methylation might switch certain genes to be on or off depending on cellular lineage and stage specificity.   \nRegulation of DNA Methylation in Stage-Specific Differentially Expressed Genes \n\n(A) At least three biological replicates for each cell type were used to run RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. Differentially expressed genes among three cell types with the criteria of fold change \u2265 2 and false discovery rate \u2264 0.01. \n\n(B) DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in 726 unique differentially expressed genes between PGCs and SSCs. \n\n(C) DNA methylation signatures in differentially expressed genes between ESCs and PGCs. Clustering was performed on 10 kb regions relative to the TSS. The y axis represents normalized methylation level and the x axis represents genome position relative to the TSS (0). The number at the lower right corner denotes log2 (gene expression fold change); green indicates downregulation, red indicates upregulation (see  ,   and  ). \n  \n\nTo uncover methylation patterns associated with gene expression change and functions of these genes, we identified clusters of genes with similar methylation profiles and corresponding expression changes by combining MBD-seq and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data ( ). Only one significant cluster (p\u00a0= 0.017) showing a pattern of DNA methylation proximal to the TSS was discovered including 661 genes that were differentially expressed between ESCs and PGCs ( C). The investigation in terms of functions and annotations of these genes also further confirmed that they were enriched in cell growth, cell division, and cell migration processes, as well as cell cycle ( ). All the above are related to PGC function as a kind of \u201ctransgenerational stem cell\u201d develops from a small population of cells that are specifically set aside in the extra-embryonic compartment very early during embryogenesis. Therefore, a lot of genes participated in cell division and cell migration when ESCs were differentiated into PGCs, and 5\u2032 methylation change of these genes might play crucial roles to regulate their mRNA transcription. Likewise, we uncovered 7 significant clusters of 1,560 genes (6.03\u00a0\u00d7 10 \u00a0< p\u00a0< 0.024) with same DNA methylation shape for each cluster and mRNA expression change. However, similar DNA methylation signatures were observed from clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, with loss methylation through TSS and CGI shores, while clusters 5, 6, and 7 have other similar methylation signatures with distal loss methylation of TSSs ( ). Pathway analysis of genes from clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed that they participated in the pathways related to the maintenance of cell and tissue structure and function, dorsoventral axis formation, and some cancers ( ). However, the genes from clusters 5, 6, and 7 with distal loss methylation involve metabolism pathways and axon growth guidance ( ). Therefore, DNA methylation change on TSS and CGI shores (TSS \u00b1 3 kb) might more tend to regulate their gene expression than distal methylation change of genes during germ cell differentiation. Collectively, the results were also in agreement with reports that testicular DNA has eight times the hypomethylated loci, and most of them are generally away from the 5\u2032 regions of genes compared with somatic tissues ( ).   \nThe Clustering of 661 Genes with 5\u2032 Methylation Change Correlated with Expression Change between ESCs and PGCs with Literature Profiles in Humans, Related to   and  \n    \n\n\n### DNA Methylation Regulation of Characteristic Genes \n  \nAs reported that PGC formation depends on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, we found that the expressions of   ALK2   receptor and   SMAD1/5   signaling are activated and committed to developing into PGCs. Shortly thereafter, PGC fate and pluripotency are maintained by some genes, such as   BLIMP1  ,   POUV (OCT4)  ,   SOX2  , and   NANOG   ( ). In our study, we found that these genes were also differentially expressed among ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs, suggesting that the   BMP   pathway,   SMAD   signaling, the   SOX   family, and   POUV  , as well as   NANOG  , could also be involved in chicken germline stem cell differentiation as they are in humans and mice. To validate and explore the function of the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/BMP signaling pathway in the regulation of male germ cell formation in the chicken, we used inhibitors, LY2109761 and LDN193189, to repress the expression of SMAD2 and SMAD5   in\u00a0vitro   and   in\u00a0vivo  .\u00a0The results indicated that the mRNA expression of   SMAD2   and   SMAD5   in inhibition groups was significantly suppressed compared with the control group during chick germ cell differentiation   in\u00a0vitro   and   in\u00a0vivo  ; furthermore, their protein expression was consistent with mRNA expression before and after inhibition, while DNA methylation showed a decreasing trend during germ cell differentiation, implying that the TGF-\u03b2/BMP4 signaling pathway could promote male germ cell formation and that DNA methylation may regulate this process (see  ).   \nInhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/BMP Signaling Pathway   In\u00a0Vitro   and   In\u00a0Vivo  \n\n(A)   SMAD2   and   SMAD5   expression were measured in control and inhibition groups on the differentiation days 4 and 14   in\u00a0vitro  \u00a0with three independent experiments\u00a0(CON, control group; LY-100, 100\u00a0nM of\u00a0LY2109761; LDN-100, 100\u00a0nM of LDN193189). The same procedure was also performed   in\u00a0vivo   on embryo development days 5.5 and 18. \n\n(B) Western blot was conducted in three cell\u00a0types with phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD5 antibodies against \u03b2  -  actin before and after inhibition   in\u00a0vitro   and   in\u00a0vivo   with three independent experiments. p-SMAD2 against SMAD2 (58\u00a0kDa); p-SMAD5 against SMAD5 (52\u00a0kDa); and \u03b2-actin against \u03b2-actin (42\u00a0kDa). \n\n(C) DNA methylation of   SMAD2   and   SMAD5   on promoter regions was measured by bisulfite cloning sequencing at three stages   in\u00a0vivo   with three independent experiments. The left panel is DNA methylation status in\u00a0each clone. White circle, unmethylated CpG; black circle, methylated CpG. The right panel is the statistic result for the left panel (see   and  ). \n  \n\nTo comprehensively study DNA methylation regulation on stem cell differentiation, we concentrated on genes associated with human stem cell differentiation and further investigated their methylation status and gene expression in chicken germline stem cells. The results showed that some genes were unmethylated in ESCs with no change of their transcriptions, but these genes could be repressed by DNA methylation when ESCs were differentiated into PGCs. Interestingly, they were activated in SCCs, such as imprinting genes, and related TFs   IGF2  ,   KLF4  , and   GDNF   (see  A, upper panel). Furthermore, some genes with low methylation levels showed high expression through all three cell types, and they participate in pathways in cancers, including colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and lung cancer, and also in hepatitis B, which suggested that these genes regulated by DNA methylation might be associated with carcinogenesis in early embryonic development, e.g.,   AKT1  ,   CCND1  ,   MYC  ,   CTNNB1  , and   PTEN   (see  A, lower panel and S3B). However, mRNA transcription of some genes seems not be affected by DNA methylation (see  A, middle panel). To refine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, we extracted genes showing a correlation between gene expression and DNA\u00a0methylation at promoter or gene body regions (CGI shores). The results showed an obvious linear correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression such as   Nanog   ( C). In addition, 31 of the genes (3.2%) related to human stem cell differentiation not only showed linear decrease dependence between their gene expression and DNA methylation but were also found to have significant methylation signatures ( ). Therefore, DNA methylation of these genes might directly control their mRNA transcriptions during chicken germline stem cell differentiation. \n\nIt is known that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a mechanism of dosage compensation that silences the majority of genes on one X chromosome in each female cell ( ). In chickens, males are the homogametic sex (ZZ), while females are the heterogametic sex (ZW). The Z chromosome is larger and has more genes, like the X chromosome in the XY system. To reveal whether this event accompanies chicken germ cell differentiation, we investigated DNA methylation distributions on chicken chromosomes and found that DNA methylation densities were higher on chromosome W than on chromosome Z, which was due to their huge difference in chromosome sizes and gene numbers ( A and S4B). To explore what genes on chromosome Z were methylated and involved in XCI, we profiled DNA methylation enrichment of promoter regions and mRNA expression for all genes on chromosome Z; the results demonstrated that DNA methylation inactivated their gene expression in PGCs and SSCs, and more genes lost DNA methylation in ESCs at the blastocyst stage; but low mRNA expression in ESCs might be due to other factors ( C). Overall, mRNA transcription of most genes on chromosome Z was\u00a0inactivated in chickens, which is consistent within mammals. \n\n\n### Cell-Type-Specific Regulators in Germ Cell Differentiation \n  \nIn adult animals, spermatogenesis involves a continuous differentiation of the spermatogonial stem and progenitor cell population into mature sperm. A unique aspect of this developmental process is the intensive germ-cell-specific transcription of genes encoding many TFs, often from alternative promoters ( ). However, the TFs for chicken germ cell differentiation remain uncharacterized. Here, we uncovered putative TFs by detecting enriched TF motifs and cell-type-specific regions of DNA methylation, and quantified their activity and specificity on nearby genes ( ). Twenty-nine ESC-specific TF motifs were found, and 9 PGC-specific and 25 SSC-specific TF motifs were identified ( ). In ESCs, the most significant TF, EWSR1-FLI1 (q\u00a0= 4.34\u00a0\u00d7 10 ), which can affect   EGR2   expression, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth when   EGR2   is silent ( ). KLF5 (q\u00a0= 9.81\u00a0\u00d7 10 ) is involved in self-renewal of mouse ESCs ( ). TF TFAP2C has been reported to be essential for PGC maintenance ( ). Moreover, the HOX family including HOXA5, HOXA9, and HOXC9, were identified in ESCs; unlike   HOX   genes, HOX TFs are usually activated in varying spatial and temporal patterns in the development of ESCs ( ). Of them, HOXA5 was studied with regard to involvement in embryo and organ development, and cell proliferation and methylation pathways ( ). As shown in  A\u20134C, downregulation of HOXA5 implies that, during early embryonic development, it commits ESCs into different lineages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)-qPCR of HOXA5 on the   GFRA2   gene indicated that HOXA5 can bind the   GFRA2   gene and their affinity would decrease when ESCs were differentiated into PGCs and then SSCs ( E). Thus, low mRNA expression of the   GFRA2   gene in ESCs might be caused by HOXA5 repression, while decreased affinity or loss of HOXA5 on   GFRA2   gene may result in activation of   GFRA2   in PGCs, but a dramatic reduction of   GFRA2   mRNA expression in SSCs could be caused by high methylation on its promoter instead of HOXA5 suppression ( D and 4E). In PGCs, TP53 might be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation through DNA methylation. Similarly, tumor protein p63, one of the p53 homologs encoded by the   TP63   gene, was also found in PGCs ( ). Moreover, SREBF1 and SREBF2 in SREBF were identified in PGCs, appearing to have a unique function as determinants of germ-cell-specific gene expression ( ). In addition, we found that some TFs were associated with somatic testicular cells, e.g., GABPA in SSCs ( ). Furthermore, the SSCs expressed several TFs (Pou5f1, Sox2) required for reprogramming fibroblasts into a pluripotent state, suggesting that a single SSC can acquire pluripotentiality in chicken ( ). FOXP factors, e.g., FOXP1 and FOXP2 in chicken SSCs, act mainly as transcriptional repressors mediated through interaction with HDAC proteins ( ), implying that these TFs might regulate spermatogenesis by histone modification ways.   \nHOXA5 Motif and Its Biological Functions \n\n(A) HOXA5 motif logo. HOXA5 is significantly identified in chicken ESCs (q\u00a0= 4.08\u00a0\u00d7 10 ). \n\n(B) Average enrichment profile of HOXA5 motif in cell-type-specific regions with HOXA5 motif hits. The regions above the horizontal black line and with a low q value mean that this TF likely binds these sequences. \n\n(C) TF activity for HOXA5 in ESCs (red star) compared with the other cell types (circles). The \u03c1 value is a correlation value between the expression level of HOXA5 and the expression of the genes nearby. The x axis represents the specificity of the expression level of HOXA5. The TF   Z   score is above 0, which means that HOXA5 is more expressed in ESC cell types than in others. The y axis denotes effects on the gene nearby the regions containing the HOXA5 motif.   Z   score targets, marked with the red star, are below 0, which means that the target genes are downregulated by HOXA5 in ESCs. \n\n(D) DNA methylation level of   GFRA2   promoter region measured by pyrosequencing and normalized mRNA expression of   GFRA2   detected by RNA-seq across three cell types. \n\n(E) HOXA5 affinity on   GFRA2   promoter was measured by ChIP-qPCR with HOXA5 antibody in three cell types with three independent experiments (see  ). \n  \n\n\n### Long Non-coding RNA and Germ Cell Differentiation \n  \nAs  A shows, most DNA methylation was enriched on chromosomes 16 and 25, while DNA methylation enrichment was not high on their genes, demonstrating that DNA methylation mainly occurred in intergenic regions of these two chromosomes. To disclose whether non-coding RNA participates in germ cell differentiation, long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), one type of non-coding RNA, was identified. In total, there were 5,925 lincRNAs recognized from three cell types. Differentially expressed lincRNAs between different cell types were analyzed, and some of them were also confirmed by qPCR ( A and S5B). Interestingly, a differentially expressed lincRNA,   MAPKAPK5  , a target gene of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the embryonic gonads in mice ( ), locates on the upstream of lincRNA5 (TCONS_00016108) and had an opposite expression profile compared with its neighboring lincRNA5 ( A and 5B). The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay of   MAPKAPK5   and lincRNA5 demonstrated that lincRNA5 can bind the promoter of the   MAPKAPK5   gene. Therefore,\u00a0lincRNA5 could fractionally bind the promoter of   MAPKAPK5   to repress gene expression in SSCs compared with that in ESCs, while high methylation might block the binding in PGCs and suppress gene expression as an alternative way ( C and 5D). To explore the expression correlation of lincRNAs and their neighboring genes, 451 differentially expressed genes between two cell types and their neighboring lincRNA were applied for expression correlation analysis ( C). Our results demonstrated that expression distribution of lincRNAs was, in general, similar to their neighboring gene. For some lincRNAs, their expression directions at two stages were that same as their neighboring genes. However, most lincRNAs seemingly did not correlate with their neighboring gene expression. Hence, lincRNA as a regulator might coordinate gene expression during germline stem cell differentiation in a sophisticated way.   \n MAPKAPK5   and Its Neighboring lincRNA   TCONS_00016108  \n\n(A) Genomic location shown for lincRNA   TCONS_00016108   (highlighted) and its neighboring gene   MAPKAPK5  . \n\n(B) Expression levels for   TCONS_00016108   (right) and   MAPKAPK5   (left) are shown across three cell types. \n\n(C) DNA methylation of   MAPKAPK5   promoter measured by MBD-seq and its gene expression measured by RNA-seq. \n\n(D) The affinity of   MAPKAPK5   with lincRNA   TCONS_00016108   was measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay with three independent experiments (see  ). \n  \n\nBecause lincRNAs are spatially correlated with TFs, often acting as scaffolds that help localize chromatin-modifying complexes important for gene transcription in   cis   or in   trans   ( ,  ), TF motifs binding to lincRNAs were screened for each cell type: 29 TF motifs, 9 TF motifs, and 14 TF motifs were found to be correlated with lincRNAs in ESC-, PGC-, and SSC-specific cells, respectively ( ). Therefore, all TFs previously predicted from ESCs and PGCs could act by lincRNAs, but partial TFs from SSCs could function through lincRNAs and epigenetic mechanisms. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWhile global DNA methylation analyses have been conducted in chickens ( ,  ), and the roles of DNA methylation in embryos explored ( ,  ,  ), we reported genome-wide DNA methylation patterns during chicken germline stem cell differentiation in this study. Our results showed that chicken ESCs isolated from blastoderm, the layer of cells forming the wall of the\u00a0blastocyst, experienced demethylation, while chicken PGCs experienced   de novo   methylation, and SSCs had decreased methylation, which is similar to the patterns observed in the mouse and human ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, we found that DNA methylation profiles of chicken embryos spanning upstream, TSS, gene body, TES, and downstream of a gene are similar to those of human and mouse embryos, and that the overall DNA methylation level of the gene body was higher than that of neighboring intergenic regions ( ), indicating that the dynamic changes of DNA methylation are in general universal throughout the entire genome among species. It is known that the process of methylation is catalyzed by three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B). In our study,   DNMT3A   and   DNMT3B   were expressed much higher in chick ESCs than in PGCs and SSCs, and they predominated in ESCs of female chicks compared with male chicks, which was consistent with previous reports that   DNMT3A   is maternally provided and that they are both expressed in early preimplantation embryos ( ) ( A). In addition,   DNMT3B   was more active than   DNMT3A   in ESCs, implying that   DNMT3B   might predominate in earlier embryonic development, which was compatible with the conclusion that the deletion of   DNMT3B   causes embryonic lethality, but that   DNMT3A   knockouts are partially viable ( ). However, the expression of   DNMT1   that can sustain genomic methylation status after DNA replication ( ) was undetected in all three cell types, which might be because   DNMT1   mainly contributes to the cell proliferation in early preimplantation embryos. \n\nSo far, it has been apparent that DNA methylation and histone modifications depend on each other. Certain histone methylations cause a readily reversible local formation of heterochromatin, whereas DNA methylation leads\u00a0to stable long-term repression ( ), especially in embryonic germ cells ( ). Therefore, a site-specific DNA methylation pattern or other epigenetic marks are likely to participate in the regulation of chick embryo development. In  C, we found that the transcription of   KDM5B  , which encodes a lysine-specific histone demethylase, was repressed from ESCs to PGCs, but DNA methylation during this process remained stable, suggesting that the transcription of histone demethylase KDM5B might be affected by a histone methylation strategy ( ,  ). To investigate the interaction between DNA methylation and histone methylation, we combined sequencing data of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (GEO:  ) to check the enrichment of DNA methylation on histone methylation regions and lincRNA regions across three kinds of germ cells ( B). The results indicated that DNA methylation was more enriched on H3K27me3 regions than on H3K4me3 regions, which was in agreement with the conclusion that DNA methylation is a \u201crepressed\u201d switch and that H3K27me3 is a \u201crepressed\u201d mark to gene transcription. Moreover, there were more overlaps between DNA methylation and histone methylation in PGCs than in ESCs and SSCs, further confirming that DNA methylation and histone modifications are dependent on each other in individual development. It is noted that DNA methylation was enriched much less in lincRNA regions compared with histone methylation regions, demonstrating that DNA methylation has more interaction with\u00a0histone methylation than with lincRNAs. To check the\u00a0relationship between lincRNAs and histone modifications, lincRNA enrichment scores were calculated in two histone methylation marks, and the results showed that lincRNAs were more enriched in H3K27me3 regions than\u00a0in H3K4me3, and that lincRNA enrichment on the H3K27me3 mark was about six times more than DNA methylation enrichment on the H3K27me3 mark (see  B and S6C), which implied that lincRNAs might prefer to interact with repressed histone marks to depress gene expression, and that lincRNAs are likely to be involved in more events of histone modifications compared with DNA methylation, which is consistent with the fact that some lincRNAs contain multiple binding sites for distinct protein complexes that direct specific combinations of histone modifications on target gene chromatin ( ). In our study, 36 SSC gene markers were detected in the chicken and they showed cell-type-specific expression during chick germ cell differentiation, which is similar within the human and mouse, suggesting that these markers could be universal gene makers to identify male germ cells ( ). Chicken-unique SSC gene markers (121) were uncovered, and their expression change could be controlled by DNA methylation ( ). \n\nIn terms of similar epigenetic discoveries of male germ cell differentiation in different organisms, we explored their shared mechanisms ( ). Interestingly, we found that increased DNA methylation on promoter regions or CGI shores would repress gene expression or adjust their expression in a dose-dependent manner. For example, decreased DNA methylation for   BCL2   and   CSF3R   genes from ESCs to PGCs activated their mRNA transcription in PGCs, and continual decrease from PGCs to SSCs caused their expression to be higher in SSCs. However, for the   IGF2R   gene, tremendously increased methylation at the stage of ESCs to PGCs turned off its mRNA transcription in PGCs, but the subsequently decreased methylation caused this gene to be fractionally expressed in SSCs ( A). We also found that DNA methylation at gene promoters has a negative effect on certain TFs. In our study, HOXA5 was identified from chick ESCs and it downregulates its target genes. As  D and 4E show,   GFRA2   as a target gene of HOXA5 had a strong affinity in ESCs, suppressing   GFRA2   gene transcription in ESCs. However, its affinity with HOXA5 decreased in PGCs, accompanying a mild\u00a0methylation change in the promoter region, which released   GFRA2   and caused it to reach a high expression in PGCs. In SSCs, increasing methylation of the   GFRA2   gene blocked HOXA5 binding to the promoter region and extremely repressed gene expression in SSCs in an alternative way ( B).   GFRA2   involves stem cell differentiation with stem markers ( ,  ), implying that HOXA5 and its target genes play vital roles in chicken male germ cell differentiation. Most interestingly, lincRNAs may bind to gene promoters. For the   MAPKAPK5   gene, extremely increased methylation on its promoter region when ESCs were differentiated into PGCs made its expression very low, even silent, in PGC cells. When PGCs became SSCs, the methylation was dramatically removed for a neighboring lincRNA binding, which could repress   MAPKAPK5   transcription instead of DNA methylation (see   and  C). Here, we consider lincRNAs acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes. For   CDX2   gene, there was no DNA methylation change across all three chicken germ cell types, but we identified STAT1 and TFAP2c TFs in ESCs, and they can be assembled by a lincRNA to form a complex with RNA polymerase II. The\u00a0expression of TFAP2c was induced by STAT1 in ESCs, and then caused TFAP2c to act on active histone mark H3K4me3, consequently upregulating   CDX2   expression. However, there were no STAT1 and TFAP2c found in PGCs and SSCs, so the loss of functions of H3K4me3 caused the   CDX2   gene to be repressed ( D). In addition, methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, BMP pathway, and SMAD signaling are also involved in chicken male germ cell differentiation (  and  ). Taken together, multiple epigenetic events, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, may act synergistically instead of single regulation mode during embryonic development, and this kind of regulation mode owns typical cell lineage specification.   \nA Schematic Representation of the Epigenetic Mechanisms and a Summary of Major Changes that occur in Chick Germline Stem Cells \n\n(A) Hypermethylation of DNA silences gene expression and hypomethylation activates gene expression. \n\n(B) The interaction of TFs and DNA methylation changes gene expression. \n\n(C) lncRNAs repress nearby gene expression in   cis  . \n\n(D) lncRNAs act as scaffolds for assembling RNA-binding TFs to recruit chromatin-modifying complexes for regulating gene expression in specific cell lineage.

Universal gene markers and unique chicken markers were discovered for identifying male germline stem cells. Moreover, the integrated epigenetic mechanisms were explored during chicken male germ cell differentiation, which will help us understand the epigenetic processes associated with male germ cell differentiation and possibly improve treatment options for male infertility in animals and humans. \n\n\n\n## Experimental Procedures \n  \nFull experimental methods are provided within  . \n\n### Sample Collection \n  \nAll eggs were immediately collected for isolation of three kinds of germline stem cells (ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs) after fertilization in the National Poultry Institute at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All procedures involving the care and use of animals conformed to U.S. National Institute of Health guidelines (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996), and were approved by the Laboratory Animal Management and Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Yangzhou University. \n\n\n### MBD-Seq and RNA-Seq \n  \nGenomic DNA from ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs was extracted for performing MBD-seq with two biological replicates per cell type. Total RNA from three cell types was prepared with multiple biological replicates. All sequencing libraries were analyzed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Analyzer following manufacturer protocols. \n\n\n### Bioinformatics Analysis \n  \nAll sequencing data were evaluated and trimmed off for high-quality assurance, and then aligned to the galGal4 reference genome by bowtie v.1.1.1 for MBD-seq data and TopHat v.2.0.9 for RNA-seq data. For data manipulation, filtration, and format conversion, a combination of procedures available in SAMtools and BEDtools was applied. Peaks of DNA methylation were called using MACS1.4.2, and the following DMRs were identified by DiffBind R package with an edgeR analysis. Mapped RNA-seq reads were assembled and analyzed by cufflinks v.2.1.1 series, and, finally, normalized gene expression was output as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). The differentially expressed genes were filtered out by particular criteria. lincRNAs were identified from RNA-seq data with a robust pipeline developed by our lab ( ). HAYSTACK pipeline was used to identify cell-type-specific TF motifs with DNA methylation data and quantify their activity on nearby genes. To uncover functional genes with differential methylation patterns associated with expression change of these genes, WIMSi was applied to identify groups of genes with similarly shaped methylation signatures and corresponding expression changes based on MBD-seq and\u00a0RNA-seq data. Our previous sequencing data in terms of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (GEO:  ) were also introduced for integration analysis. \n\n\n### Validation Experiments \n  \nA few DMRs were selected and validated by bisulfite cloning sequencing as well as DNA methylation of   SMAD2   and   SMAD5   on promoters. The results were analyzed by QUMA ( ), and DNA methylation levels for each region and group were obtained. DNA methylation of some genes involved in   was confirmed using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. Real-time PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix was utilized to validate differentially expressed lincRNAs between cell types. \n\nTo explore the function of the TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling pathway in the regulation of male germ cell formation, TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-specific inhibitors, LY-100 and LDN-100, were added to inhibit Smad2 and Smad5 expression   in\u00a0vitro   and   in\u00a0vivo  . qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the inhibition efficiency of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. The phosphorylated SMAD protein levels were identified by western blotting before and after inhibition   in\u00a0vitro   and   in\u00a0vivo   with triple biological replicates. ChIP was performed with HOXA5 antibody in three cell types, and a subsequent qPCR was\u00a0applied for measuring HOXA5 affinity on   GFRA2   promoter through all cell types. To validate whether the   MAPKAPK5   gene is bound to its neighboring lincRNA, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was conducted in the T293 cell line to avoid the effects of chicken endogenous genes. The   MAPKAPK5   reporter gene vector and the lincRNA overexpression vector were constructed and transfected in 293T cells. Finally, luciferase expression indicated the binding of lincRNA to the cloned   MAPKAPK5   target sequence. \n\n\n\n## Accession Numbers \n  \nSequencing data are available in the NCBI SRA database.

It predisposes lungs to inflammatory conditions associated with acute lung injury and increased incidence of pneumonia and sepsis, which may lead to death due to acute respiratory distress syndrome in some individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). In general, rodent models of alcohol exposure either do not recapitulate multiple organ injuries as seen in humans or require longer duration to establish tissue injury and inflammation. The recently introduced NIAAA model of alcohol-induced liver injury, characterized by a marked increase in steatosis and liver damage with 10\u00a0days of a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol followed by a single ethanol binge (5\u00a0g/kg). Therefore, we employed this model to explore the status of surfactant phospholipids, oxidative stress, tissue injury markers and inflammatory cytokines in lungs. In lungs of C57BL/6J mice, the alcohol feeding significantly increased levels of the surfactant phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as well as the truncated oxidized phosphatidylcholines palmitoyl oxovaleryl phosphatidyl-choline (POVPC), palmitoyl glutaryl phosphatidyl-choline (PGPC), palmitoyl oxo-nonanoyl phosphatidyl-choline (ALDO-PC), and palmitoyl azelaoyl phosphatidyl-choline (PAzePC) at 9\u00a0h post-binge. Additionally, gene expression of the enzymes catalyzing lipid oxidation, such as arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15), prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2), Cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2E1) and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) were significantly increased. Furthermore, ethanol increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-17 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In conclusion, the NIAAA alcohol feeding model might be suitable to study alcohol-induced lung injury and inflammation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the inability to stop or control alcohol consumption despite negative consequences. According to the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 14 million people ages 18 and older in the United States had AUD, which is 5.6% of this age group ( ;  ). \n\nThe negative health consequences of AUD are well-established. Historically, liver injury is recognized as the predominant consequence of alcohol consumption in peripheral organs. Aside from the liver, alcohol also damages other organs, including the lungs ( ), which is the major focus of this study. \n\nPossible mechanisms for alcohol-induced lung injury include increased oxidative stress, altered tissue remodeling ( ), and dysregulated lung inflammation ( ). Eventually, these can result in a defective immune response during host defense immunity. All of these mechanisms make the lungs susceptible to inflammatory and progressive lung disorders ( ). While alcohol primes the lungs for secondary insult resulting in various pathological conditions, we need to understand common pathological pathways triggered by alcohol in appropriate experimental models, which will aid in the identification of therapeutic targets for alcoholic lung injury. Recently, the NIAAA alcohol drinking model (chronic and single binge alcohol) has been advanced as a rodent model of alcohol-induced liver injury with marked increases in steatosis and tissue injury markers like ALT and AST ( ). Additionally, the same model was also shown to promote lung inflammation and hyperresponsiveness to broncho-constrictive stimuli after alcohol binge ( ). However, the cellular mechanisms of lung injury observed in this model have not been explored in detail. Therefore, we employed the NIAAA alcohol drinking model in C57Bl/6J mice to explore the status of surfactant phospholipids, oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are critical indicators of lung health status. \n\nWe found the NIAAA alcohol feeding model reasonably well replicates the manifestations of lung inflammation and injury such as dysregulated surfactant phospholipids, increased oxidative stress, and elevated truncated oxidized phospholipids and inflammatory cytokines. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Animals and Ethanol Feeding \n  \nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) under the protocol LPS-GK1. Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, United States). Mice were exposed to either control or ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. The NIAAA model of chronic and binge ethanol feeding was followed as described ( ). In brief, mice were fed a control liquid diet for 5\u00a0days, after which they divided into two groups: a pair-fed control group and an ethanol-fed group. For the next 10\u00a0days, the ethanol-fed group received a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol, whereas the pair-fed control group received an isocaloric control liquid diet. On day 11, the pair-fed control mice received maltose dextrin   via   gavage, and the ethanol-fed mice received 5\u00a0g/kg ethanol by gavage. The experimental paradigm is depicted in  . Four- five mice used per group. \n  \nExperimental paradigm of the NIAAA alcohol feeding model in mice.   (A)   Schematic presentation of the NIAAA alcohol feeding model.   (B)   Levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in serum. Data represent mean +S.E.M from 4 mice per group. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. * (  p   < 0.05), ** (  p   < 0.01) indicates significant difference from the pair-fed control group. \n  \nFollowing the gavage, mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Serum was obtained from by retroorbital bleeding. Left lung tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein and mass spectrometry analysis. Portions of right lung tissue were placed in RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific) and were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight for RNA extraction. \n\n\n### ALT and AST Measurements \n  \nSerum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were measured using EnzyChrom\u2122 Alanine Transaminase Assay Kit and EnzyChrom\u2122 Aspartate Transaminase Assay Kit, respectively (BioAssay Systems). \n\n\n### Real-Time Quantitative PCR Analysis \n  \nRNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Expression of the target genes was quantified using gene-specific primers and PowerSYBRGreen master mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) in a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). Predesigned mouse Alox15 (QT00111034), Ptgs1 (QT00155330), Ptgs2 (QT00165347), Nox1 (QT00140091), Nox4 (QT00126042), Aldh2 (QT00158368), Adh1 (QT00093520), Cyp2e1 (QT00112539), Cybb (QT00139797) primers were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Fold changes in gene expression relative to the house-keeping gene TATA-Box Binding Protein (Tbp, QT00198443) were determined. \n\n\n### Mass Spectrometry Measurements \n  \nLevels of phosphatidylcholines (DPPC, PAPC, POPC) and truncated oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PGPC, POVPC, PAzePC, 16-9-ALDOPC) were measured in lungs by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Left lung tissue was homogenized in 0.5\u00a0ml of ice-cold methanol/Tris buffer (50\u00a0mM, pH 8.0), 1:1, containing 250\u00a0ng of [ H ] Platelet Activating Factor C-16 ([ H ] PAF C-16) as internal standard. Homogenates were extracted three times with CHCl : MeOH (2:1, vol/vol), dried under nitrogen flow and reconstituted with MeOH after precipitating proteins with ice-cold acetone. LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted on an Agilent 6,470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) coupled to an Agilent 1200\u00a0LC system. Analytes were separated using an Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120\u00a0EC-C18 column (3.0 \u00d7 100\u00a0mm, 2.7 micron). Gradient elution mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in H O (phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in MeOH (phase B). Gradient elution (350\u00a0\u03bcL/min) was initiated at 10% B followed by a linear increase to 50% B at 0.5\u00a0min and then another linear increase to 85% B at 3\u00a0min and maintained until 14\u00a0min before increasing linearly to 100% B by 18\u00a0min and maintained until 38\u00a0min. The mass spectrometer was set for Agilent Jet Stream high sensitivity electrospray ionization operated in positive ion mode. The source parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3500\u00a0V; gas temperature, 300\u00b0C; drying gas flow, 5\u00a0L/min; sheath gas temperature, 250\u00b0C; sheath gas flow, 10\u00a0L/min. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas. Collision-induced dissociation was performed using nitrogen. Levels of each compound were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring. The molecular ion and fragment for each compound were measured as follows: m/z 734.6\u2192183.9 for DPPC, m/z 782.6\u2192183.9 for PAPC, m/z 746.6\u2192183.9 for POPC, m/z 610.4\u2192183.9 for PGPC, m/z 594.4\u2192183.9 for POVPC, m/z 650.4\u2192183.9 for 16-9-ALDOPC, m/z: 482.4 \u2192104.1 for Lyso-PAF C16:0, m/z:524.4 \u2192183.9 for PAF C16:0\u00a0m/z 666.4\u2192183.9 for PAzePC, m/z 528.4\u2192184 for [ H ]PAF C16:0. Analytes were quantified using MassHunter Workstation LC/QQQ Acquisition and MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis software (Agilent Technologies). Levels of lipids in the samples were measured against standard curves. \n\n\n### LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury \n  \nTo induce acute lung injury, 16-week-old mice received a single oropharyngeal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50\u00a0\u00b5g/mouse) as described previously ( ). LPS (L4391, Millipore Sigma) was dissolved in sterile saline and administered at 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mouse in 40\u00a0\u00b5L after anesthesia induced by ketamine/xylazine. In this part of the study both pair-fed control and ethanol-fed mice received sterile saline. The mice were studied 24\u00a0h after LPS or saline instillation, as depicted schematically in  . \n\n\n### BALF Collection From Mice \n  \nBALF was collected from anesthetized mice by lavaging lungs three times with 0.8\u00a0ml Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium (HBSS) (Sigma Aldrich). Supernatants were collected as BALF for further analyses. \n\n\n### Lactate Dehydrogenase Cytotoxicity Assay \n  \nCyQuant LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to assess LDH activity in BALF samples, as detailed in the product manual. \n\n\n### Level of Albumin in BALF \n  \nAlbumin levels were measured by Mouse Albumin Elisa Assay kit obtained from Bethyl Laboratories. BALF samples from pair-fed control and ethanol-fed mice were diluted at 1:1000 ratio, whereas samples from LPS group were diluted at 1:2000 ratio. \n\n\n### Levels of Total Protein in BALF \n  \nTotal protein in BALF samples was measured using Pierce BCA protein assay kit as detailed in the product manual (ThermoFisher Scientific). \n\n\n### Cytokine Measurements \n  \nLevels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and Interleukin 17 (IL17) in mouse BALF were measured using the mouse CCL2 quantikine ELISA Kit, (R&D systems, MJE00B), mouse TNF-alpha quantikine ELISA Kit, (R&D systems, MTA00B), mouse IL-1\u03b2 quantikine ELISA Kit, (R&D systems, MLB00C), mouse IL-17 quantikine ELISA Kit, (R&D systems, M1700), respectively. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test was performed.   p   < 0.05 was considered significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Oxidative Stress in Lungs Increased by Chronic and Single Binge Ethanol Feeding \n  \nThe NIAAA mouse model of chronic with binge ethanol feeding was utilized in this study because the model is known to better induce liver injury, inflammation and fatty liver, as compared to ethanol feeding models without addition of a binge or secondary insult. The chronic with binge model is also thought to better mimic the drinking patterns of people with an AUD ( ). To verify that the ethanol feeding model induced liver injury, we measured serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in pair-fed (PF) control mice and ethanol-fed (EtOH) mice. ALT and AST were significantly elevated in the serum of EtOH mice as compared to PF mice at the 9-h time point only ( ), indicating significant acute liver injury, which is then mostly resolved by 24-h post-Ethanol binge. \n\nIncreased oxidative stress has been postulated as a possible mechanism of alcohol-induced lung injury ( ;  ). We therefore measured gene expression of oxidative enzymes known to be involved in oxidative stress, such as the inflammatory oxidative enzymes arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15), prostaglandin synthase 1 and 2 (Ptgs1 and Ptgs2), and NADPH oxidase 1, 2 and 4 (Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4). Alox15 gene expression was significantly increased 9\u00a0h after the binge and then remained elevated for 24\u00a0h ( ). Ptgs2 gene expression was only increased at 24\u00a0h after the binge whereas no change was observed in Ptgs1 expression ( ). Nox1 expression was significantly increased and Nox2 was decreased at 9\u00a0h after the binge, which then normalized at 24\u00a0h post-binge, whereas we have not observed any changes in Nox4 expression in lung post-binge ( ). Multiple alcohol metabolizing enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1), alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (Aldh2) and Cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2E1) are functionally expressed in lungs ( ;  ). They may also contribute oxidative stress in lungs in addition to alcohol metabolism ( ). We found that alcohol has not changed gene expression levels of Adh1 and Aldh2 ( ) whereas expression level of Cyp2e1 is significantly increased ( ). These results indicate increased oxidative stress in lungs following chronic ethanol and single binge. Since we found significant and sustained elevation in gene expression of several oxidative enzymes, we further explored its functional consequences on lung phospholipid homeostasis. \n  \nChronic and single binge ethanol feeding increased expression of oxidative enzymes in mouse lungs.

Data represent mean +S.E.M from 4-5 mice per group. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. * (  p   < 0.05), **** (  p   < 0.0001) indicates significant difference from the pair-fed control group. \n  \n\n### Chronic Ethanol and Single Binge Dysregulate Surfactant Phospholipid Homeostasis and Increases Truncated Oxidized Phosphatidylcholines \n  \nSurfactant phospholipid homeostasis is critical for lung function and host defense. Surfactant phospholipids predominantly consist of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) that about 60% of surfactant lipids in the lungs consist of DPPC. Besides, cellular phospholipids with mono or poly unsaturated fatty acid moieties such as palmitoyl arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine (PAPC), palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and palmitoyl linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PLPC) could also involve multiple inflammatory and oxidative processes. Previously, it was shown that chronic alcohol feeding for 6\u20138\u00a0weeks increased levels of phosphatidylcholines ( ). Using the NIAAA model, we found that DPPC was significantly increased 9\u00a0h after the single binge ( ). Although there is a slight trend towards increased levels of PAPC and POPC, these changes are not statistically significant ( ). \n  \nChronic and single binge ethanol feeding induced elevation of truncated oxidized phospholipids in muse lungs.   (A)   Levels of surfactant phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC), and cellular phospholipids palmitoyl-arachidonoyl phosphatidyl choline (PAPC), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) in lungs.

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. * (  p   < 0.05), ** (  p   < 0.01) indicates significant difference from the pair-fed control group. \n  \nOne of the consequences of an ethanol-induced increase in oxidative stress and in the expression of Alox15 in lungs would be lipid oxidation and generation of truncated oxidized phospholipids (tOxPLs). tOxPLs are bioactive and can have harmful effects on tissues ( ). For example, the tOxPLs of PAPC (lyso-PC, POVPC, and PGPC) increased endothelial cell permeability in a dose-dependent manner and were barrier disruptive ( ). Importantly, tOxPLs could contribute to lung injury, and they are lipid mediators of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lungs ( ). To explore the status of tOxPLs in lungs in the NIAAA model, we measured the levels of tOxPLs such as palmitoyl oxovaleryl phosphatidyl choline (POVPC), palmitoyl glutaryl phosphatidyl choline (PGPC), palmitoyl oxo-nonanoyl phosphatidyl choline (ALDO-PC), and palmitoyl azelaoyl phosphatidyl choline (PAzePC). POVPC and PGPC are the tOxPLs of surfactant phospholipid PAPC, while ALDO-PC and PAzePC are the tOxPLs of surfactant phospholipid POPC and PLPC. At the 9-h time point, ethanol significantly increased the levels of POVPC, PGPC, ALDO-PC, and PAzePC in the lungs as compared to control lungs ( ). At the 24-h time point, mild but not significant increases in the levels of all four tOxPLs were observed ( ). Truncated oxidized phospholipids are structural analogue of Platelet activator factors (PAFs) and Lyso-PAFs. Indeed, there are evidence that they bind to PAF receptors. Therefore, we also check the levels of PAFs. Alcohol ingestion has not changed the levels of PAF C16:0 ( ) or lyso-PAF C16:0 ( ). These results suggest that oxidative stress transiently increases tOxPLs, which act as inflammatory lipid mediators in the lungs of ethanol-fed mice. \n\n\n### Effects of EtOH Versus LPS on Vascular Permeability, Epithelial and Cell Membrane Integrity, and Cytotoxicity the in Lungs \n  \nHallmarks of acute lung injury include increased vascular permeability, cytotoxicity, and disrupted epithelial and cell membrane integrity ( ). It is known that heavy alcohol drinking in individuals with AUD increases vascular permeability and dysregulates epithelial integrity in lungs ( ;  ). To explore the status of acute lung injury in the NIAAA model, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice 9\u00a0h after the ethanol binge feeding and measured albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein in BALF as indicators of increased vascular permeability, cytotoxicity and disrupted epithelial integrity. For comparison, we made similar measurements in the BALF of mice following oropharyngeal LPS instillation, an established model of acute lung injury. Levels of albumin, total protein and LDH were not altered in BALF by 10\u00a0days chronic ethanol followed by a single binge ( ), whereas LPS significantly increased albumin, total protein and LDH activity in BALF ( ), indicating acute lung injury. \n  \nThe NIAAA ethanol feeding model did not alter vascular permeability, and epithelial cell membrane integrity but did increase inflammatory cytokines in BALF   (A)   Schematic presentation of ethanol feeding and oropharyngeal LPS (50\u00a0ug/mice) induced lung injury model. Levels of   (B)   Albumin,   (C)   Total protein,   (D)   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity   (E)   MCP-1,   (F)   TNF\u03b1,   (G)   IL-1\u03b2 and   (H)   IL-17 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice 9\u00a0h after either pair-fed or ethanol binge following 10\u00a0days chronic feeding or 24\u00a0h after oropharyngeal LPS instillation. Data represent mean +S.E.M from 4-5 mice per group. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. * (  p   < 0.05), ** (  p   < 0.01), *** (  p   < 0.001), **** (  p   < 0.0001) indicates significant difference from the pair-fed control group. \n  \n\n### Chronic Ethanol Plus Single Binge Feeding Increased IL-17 Protein Level in BALF \n  \nTo explore status of inflammatory cytokines in lung after either chronic feeding plus single ethanol binge or LPS instillation, we measured inflammatory cytokines in BALF. LPS instillation significantly increased the BALF content of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and Interleukin 17 (IL17) ( ). in contrast, ethanol did not significantly alter the BALF levels of MCP-1, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 ( ) but significantly increased IL17 to levels seen after LPS instillation ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe have demonstrated that chronic ethanol followed by a single binge increases gene expression of oxidative stress-related enzymes, levels of truncated oxidized phospholipids as a consequence of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in lungs of C57BL/6J mice using the NIAAA alcohol model. Several studies have investigated the role of oxidative stress in alcohol-induced lung injury ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In a clinical study, heavy alcohol use was associated with a four-fold decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels in the BALF, regardless of smoking status ( ;  ). It is known that alcohol can promote lung injury by increasing oxidative stress in heavy alcohol drinkers ( ). Previously, long-duration of alcohol exposure models demonstrated increased oxidative stress in lungs ( ). Here, we demonstrated using 10\u00a0days of chronic ethanol (5%) and single ethanol binge (5\u00a0g/kg) feeding causes an increased expression of oxidative enzymes (Alox15, Ptgs2, Nox1,Cyp2E1), which may contribute to oxidative stress and lung inflammation   via   lipid oxidation with generating inflammatory bioactive lipids such as truncated oxidized phospholipids ( ). Additionally, the NIAAA model caused dysregulation of surfactant phospholipids by increasing their amount in mice, which is in agreement with previously reported data in lungs of 7\u00a0weeks ethanol-fed rats ( ). One of the critical outcomes of increased oxidative stress in lungs could be generation of truncated oxidized phospholipids such as POVPC, PGPC, ALDO-PC, and PAzePC. These tOxPLs are proinflammatory through binding to diverse receptors including Platelet-activating factor receptor and Toll-like receptor 4, among others ( ). tOxPLs are also lipid inflammatory mediators of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( ). tOxPLs are formed by an enzymatic mechanism   via   direct action of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) on phospholipids, and/or indirect formation through eicosanoid incorporation into lyso-phospholipids. Increased gene expression of ALOX15, encodes 15-LO, ptgs2, encodes cyclooxygenase-2, and Cyp2e1, encodes Cytochrome P450 2E1. Although we have not measured direct functional activity and protein levels of these enyzmes, one of the critical outcomes of the increased oxidative stress would be an increased generation of tOxPL. Indeed, we found that ethanol ingestion increased truncated oxidized phospholipids such as POVPC, PGPC, ALDO-PC, and PAzePC as a result of increased oxidative stress in lungs. \n\nAcute binge drinking in healthy individuals increases serum levels of LPS and inflammatory cytokines ( ). Additionally, the increase in serum endotoxin levels in chronic drinkers has been proposed as a critical factor for alcohol-induced tissue injuries ( ). Chronic ethanol exposure was also shown to potentiate LPS-induced lung injury in mice ( ). Here, we showed that chronic ethanol followed by a single binge increased IL-17 levels in BALF similarly as seen in LPS induced lung injury ( ). However, the inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were only significantly elevated in BALF by LPS induction. A slight IL-1\u03b2 increase together with significant IL-17 elevation by ethanol feeding suggests an existing inflammatory microenvironment in the lungs, which is not sufficient to induce severe lung injury alone as observed with LPS ( ). Chronic ethanol exposure in mice increased IL-17 related inflammatory responses systemically ( ). Besides, circulating IL-17 levels are positively correlated with heavy alcohol drinking, and are further increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease ( ). Furthermore, alcohol-induced overactivation of IL-17 signaling contributes to liver injury and fibrosis, which could be prevented by attenuating IL-17 signaling ( ). IL-17 is primarily secreted by neutrophils and lymphocytes. It was shown that the NIAAA model increased neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration in lungs ( ). Therefore, infiltrated neutrophils and/or lymphocytes might be responsible for increased IL-17 levels in BALF. Recent study demonstrated using 8\u00a0weeks alcohol drinking model in mice that alcohol-induced IL-17 and Th17 immune response promotes lung fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts ( ), eventually this could cause fibroproliferative microenvironment in lungs of chronic alcohol drinkers. Therefore, IL-17 might be an important mediator in alcohol-induced lung injury and subsequent fibroproliferative disorders, which warrants further investigation. \n\nWe tested whether 10\u00a0days chronic ethanol followed by a single binge feeding could be sufficient to induce acute lung injury. As a basis for comparison, we also used the LPS-induced acute lung injury model, which causes severe lung injury. We found that ethanol by itself as used in the NIAAA model was not sufficient to induce severe acute lung injury comparable to that seen in the LPS-induced lung injury model ( ). Although, we could not see a severe lung injury by Alcohol compared to the LPS, this suggest there might be delayed chronic injury by alcohol since it increased circulating LPS levels in heavy drinkers. Besides, It is known that alcohol has a priming effect in sensitizing the lungs to secondary insults such as lipopolysaccharide ( ) or bleomycin ( ). Dysregulation of surfactant phospholipids and increases in truncated oxidized phospholipids may be part of the mechanism by which alcohol consumption and the resulting oxidative stress increases susceptibility to acute lung injury ( ), enhances lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury ( ), and exacerbates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis ( ). Alcohol use disorder was characterized as the only independent risk factor known to increase the chance of any given at-risk individual developing ARDS ( ). ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury with a mortality rate of about 40% and without effective pharmacological treatment ( ). Specifically, patients who misuse alcohol were 3.7 times more likely to develop ARDS as compared to non-AUD individuals ( ;  ). Additionally, in patients who developed sepsis, the incidence of ARDS was 52% in patients with a history of AUD versus only 20% for patients without a history of AUD ( ). Therefore, identifying critical mechanisms driving susceptibility to ARDS in individuals with AUD could have important clinical implications for the development of specific therapies. Current study, increased tOxPLs and IL-17 could indicate an inflammatory process in lungs after chronic and a single binge ethanol feeding. Therefore, further studies are warranted to explore alcohol effects on lung health using the NIAAA drinking model with potentially extending the ethanol feeding duration and/or combination of secondary insults. \n\nHeavy alcohol drinking increases incidence of pneumonia and sepsis, which may lead to death due to ARDS in some individuals ( ). While the world is significantly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-COV-2 infection, one of the negative health outcomes of heavy alcohol drinking on lungs would be predisposing individuals with AUD for poor prognosis when suffering from SARS-COV-2 associated pneumonia and ARDS ( ). Beside the serious and acute health threat represented by COVID-19, there is also growing concern about potential late complications among survivors of an acute COVID-19 infection, such as pulmonary fibrosis. For instance, in patients with COVID who were discharged from hospitals, impaired lung physiology was seen in up to 56% of patients at 6\u00a0months and persistent radiological changes were detected in 24% of patients at 12\u00a0months ( ;  ). tOxPLs are known to activate macrophages to acquire fibroproliferative phenotype ( ). In the current study, we demonstrated that alcohol ingestion increased tOxPLs in lungs. Since alcohol misuse could dysregulate tissue remodeling in lungs toward fibroproliferative changes and prime lungs for a secondary injury ( ;  ), COVID-19 survivors with AUD may have higher incidence of developing late respiratory complications. With the emerging health crisis caused by COVID-19, it is important to find out whether and how certain co-morbidities, such as AUD, may worsen the prognosis of this potentially fatal viral infection and its long-term sequelae in the lungs. Therefore, future studies combining experimental models of alcohol ingestion and lung injury and/or infection could be instrumental for understanding the effects of alcohol in inflammatory and infectious lung diseases. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9171009, "text_md5": "3f25110a21c81371e4f0faa0195bff5a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 82], "journal": [83, 96], "publication_year": [98, 102], "title": [113, 246], "keywords": [260, 324], "abstract": [337, 2147], "body": [2156, 29892]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35685280, "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2022.860449", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9171009", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9171009"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9171009\">9171009</a>", "list_title": "PMC9171009  Chronic and Binge Alcohol Ingestion Increases Truncated Oxidized Phosphatidylcholines in Mice Lungs Due to Increased Oxidative Stress"}

LostArc reveals 35 million deletions (~\u2009470,000 unique spans) in skeletal muscle from 22 individuals with and 19 individuals without pathogenic variants in POLG. This nuclear gene encodes the catalytic subunit of replicative mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3. Ablation, the deleted mtDNA fraction, suffices to explain skeletal muscle phenotypes of aging and POLG-derived disease. Unsupervised bioinformatic analyses reveal distinct age- and disease-correlated deletion patterns. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThese patterns implicate replication by DNA polymerase \u03b3 as the deletion driver and suggest little purifying selection against mtDNA deletions by mitophagy in postmitotic muscle fibers. Observed deletion patterns are best modeled as mtDNA deletions initiated by replication fork stalling during strand displacement mtDNA synthesis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlong with many other vital functions, mitochondria generate most of the cell\u2019s energy through aerobic respiration. In humans, as in most eukaryotes, mitochondria possess their own indispensable genome (mtDNA) which replicates separately from the nuclear genome. Human mtDNA is a 16.6-kb closed circular molecule encoding 37 genes required to make 13 essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, as well as critical elements of the mitochondrial translational machinery (Fig.\u00a0 a). OXPHOS drives adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, generating energy for cellular consumption. Each human cell contains hundreds to thousands of mtDNA copies existing in a mixture of wild type and mutated molecular species that is collectively called heteroplasmy [ \u2013 ]. Low levels of heteroplasmy have been detected in most healthy individuals [ ], whereas high levels of heteroplasmy have been implicated in a broad range of neurometabolic disorders under the umbrella term of \u201cmitochondrial diseases\u201d [ \u2013 ].\n   \nThe human mtDNA reference map and the mtDNA deletion mapping pipeline.   a   Human mtDNA reference map, color-coded by feature. Inset: respiratory chain complexes encoded by mtDNA (color) and nuclear genes (gray). MtDNA-encoded genes and feature abbreviations: tRNA genes, IUPAC single-letter amino acid codes; rRNA genes, sedimentation coefficients (e.g., 16S); previously proposed heavy and light strand features, _H and _L; promoters, P_; replication origins, O_ (e.g., PH1, OL); and   MT-   prefixes are omitted. The 7S-3\u2032-terminus and   oriL   are indicated (red and green arrows).   b   LostArc method outline.   c   The mtDNA fractions (mean\u2009\u00b1\u200995% CL) indicate enrichment during library preparation and a subsequent lack of selection in sequencing (qPCR for steps 1, 3, and 4b, fraction of reads mapped to mtDNA reference for step 7). See also Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1.   d   Estimated mtDNA frequencies. Species with frequencies over 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910  must reside in multiple truncated fibers (i.e., they predate adulthood or mark mutational hotspots). Deletions observed \u2265\u20092x must have \u2265\u200920 copies in the muscle sample. Deletions observed once will have frequencies inflated to roughly 1/depth. These collectively represent all less frequent species \n  \n\nPathogenic variants of at least 24 nuclear genes whose protein products are responsible for mtDNA maintenance co-segregate with mitochondrial disease [ \u2013 ]. Two such genes (  POLG   and   POLG2  , respectively) encode the catalytic and accessory subunits of DNA polymerase \u03b3 (Pol \u03b3). Pol \u03b3 is a family A DNA polymerase with 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease and 5\u2032-dRP lyase activities and the only known mitochondrial replicase [ ,  ]. Pol \u03b3 works in concert with the Twinkle helicase, a mitochondrial ssDNA binding protein and other accessory factors to carry out efficient mtDNA replication [ ,  ]. Pathogenic mutations in   POLG   are the most common cause of mitochondrial disease linked to improper maintenance of the mitochondrial genome [ ]. Over three hundred missense mutations in   POLG   have been reported to cause a wide spectrum of mitochondrial diseases with ages of onset ranging from early (childhood myocerebrohepatopathy or Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome) to late (ataxia neuropathies or progressive external ophthalmoplegia) [ ,  ]. Pathogenic   POLG   variants encode proteins with assorted biochemical deficiencies, including catalytic deficits, structural instability, and defects in binding DNA or accessory proteins [ ]. Early-onset   POLG   disorders are associated with a quantitative loss of mtDNA copies (mtDNA depletion), whereas later-onset   POLG   disorders are associated with accumulation of mtDNA deletions [ ]. \n\nPoint mutations and deletions in mtDNA accumulate with age and have been implicated in normal aging and age-related pathologies [ \u2013 ]. However, as assayed in human brain tissue, the accumulation of point mutations is orders of magnitude too low to explain the phenotypes of aging [ ]. Prior work by this group had shown that point mutations in mtDNA do not limit the natural lifespan of mice [ ]. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the greater genetic disruption caused by mtDNA deletions may be a significant contributor to mechanisms of aging. Disruption of Pol \u03b3\u2019s exonuclease function prevents proofreading of DNA replication errors [ ], resulting in a 160-fold increase in mtDNA deletions in yeast [ ]. In homozygous   POLG   exonuclease deficient mice [ ,  ], random mutation capture assays identified mtDNA deletions as a causative factor in the premature aging phenotype [ ]. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the formation of mtDNA deletions are not well defined. Several models have been proposed, including primer relocation between direct repeats during mtDNA replication [ ,  ] and ectopic re-annealing of broken strands within short homologous DNA sequences [ ]. \n\nTo gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying formation of mtDNA deletions and to define the roles of deletions in aging and human mitochondrial disease, we sought to delineate the position, length, sequence context, and abundance of individual mtDNA deletions in human tissue samples. Because mtDNA represents only 0.93% of total DNA in human skeletal muscle, existing deletion detection techniques rely on PCR to selectively enrich for mtDNA sequences [ ,  ]. In order to avoid PCR artifacts and target biasing due to primer selection, we developed LostArc, an ultra-sensitive high throughput deletion detection pipeline. Here, we used LostArc to analyze mtDNA sequences from skeletal muscle samples of mitochondrial disease patients bearing inherited pathogenic   POLG   variants and from age-matched individuals with wild type   POLG  . Hundreds of thousands of unique deletions were identified with frequencies sufficient to explain the musculoskeletal phenotypes of aging and disease. Patterns in the locations and sequence contexts suggest that DNA replication is the primary driver of deletion formation and strongly support asynchronous strand displacement models of mtDNA replication. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe LostArc method was applied to cultured human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) and 41 skeletal muscle biopsies (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1): 19 biopsies with wild type   POLG   sequences (Gwt samples; biopsied at 17 to 93\u2009years of age; GenBank NM_002693.2) and 22 samples with variant   POLG   sequences (Gvar; 17 to 80\u2009years). The latter include 18 variant   POLG   alleles in 17 combinations with a continuum of clinical symptoms (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S2). Eleven of these variant samples have not been previously reported. Three variants (G952R, M797I, and T914P) and one genotypic combination (A467T   in trans   with S933R) were not found in the Leiden Open Variation Database [ ], NCBI ClinVar [ ], or the Human DNA Polymerase Gamma Mutation Database ( ) [ ]. In total, 35 million mtDNA deletions were identified, relative to the reference sequence (Fig.\u00a0 a; GenBank AF347015.1), encompassing roughly 470,000 unique spans (dbGaP phs002052.v1.p1). \n\n### The LostArc pipeline, its outputs, and the human mtDNA reference map \n  \nGenomic DNA was isolated from approximately 25\u2009mg sample of each frozen skeletal muscle tissue (Fig.\u00a0 b step 1). Linear DNA, predominantly nuclear, from 0.2 to 2.0\u2009\u03bcg of the resulting genomic DNA, was digested with Exonuclease V and a cocktail of seven restriction endonucleases that did not cut mtDNA (steps 2\u20133). Remaining DNA was column purified and concentrated, and the nuclear and mtDNA components were quantified via real-time PCR (step 4a). If the mtDNA was found to be under 30% of the total, then nuclease treatment and purification steps were repeated (step 4b). Sequencing libraries were prepared via transposon-mediated tagmentation using the minimum sufficient number of PCR amplification cycles, followed by purification and quantitation (step 5). Libraries were sequenced (step 6) and the resulting reads were filtered, trimmed, and then mapped to the circular human mtDNA reference via the ROTLA package (steps 7\u20138, see the \u201c \u201d section). Among all samples, the mtDNA fraction rose from an average of 0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52% (  n  \u2009=\u200917; \u00b1\u200995% CL) in whole DNA extracts to an average of 73\u2009\u00b1\u200911% at the beginning of library preparation. The final fraction of sequencing reads that mapped to the mtDNA genome was 61\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3%. Examples from individual samples are presented in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figure S1a. Several samples, including one Gwt (M05), had lower mtDNA fractions than indicated by qPCR (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1b). These samples were not unified by age or genotype, so the cause of this effect is unknown. Deletion counts were converted into deletion frequencies and their patterns were analyzed (steps 9\u201310). Individual deletion frequencies above 10  were highly reproducible (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S2). \n\nLostArc was designed to measure accurately the individual frequencies of very rare deletant species and the total frequency of ultra-rare deletant species (boundary set at approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910  by the sensitivity achieved; see Methods). Library preparation and sequencing added no systematic bias for or against mtDNA (see Fig.\u00a0 c for averages, Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1 for individual samples; see Methods for details). High sequencing depth (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1) allowed the LostArc method to call roughly one deletion per million mtDNA circles (10 ; median\u2009\u00b1\u200995% CL in the exponent). LostArc sensitivity exceeds that for sequencing after long-range PCR [ ] but not for digital drop PCR (~\u200910  [ ,  ,  ];). Unlike digital drop PCR, which targets deletions at specific loci, LostArc assays the full deletion spectrum across the whole mitochondrial genome. LostArc captures a representative subset of uniquely deleted molecules (10  each) while easily mapping deletions that dominate one homoplasmic muscle fiber within a sample (~\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , Fig.\u00a0 d; see Methods for details). \n\n\n### Levels of mtDNA do not vary significantly with age \n  \nEstimates of mtDNA as a fraction of total DNA ranged from 0.01 to 4.5%. Among tested Gwt samples, the average mtDNA content is 0.78% (  n  \u2009=\u20096; examples in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1a, blue bars), in line with previous estimates [ ]. The Gvar samples we tested were not significantly different in this regard (mean 0.89%;   n  \u2009=\u200910; 1-tailed Welch\u2019s   t   test   p  \u2009=\u20090.41). There is no significant linear relationship between age and mtDNA copy number (via qPCR; representative subset in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1a; Gwt   R  \u2009=\u20090.44; Gvar   R  \u2009=\u20090.21). \n\n\n### Levels of mtDNA ablation vary with age \n  \nIn human skeletal muscle cells, raw deletion loads do not correlate with age (Fig.\u00a0 a;   R  \u2009<\u20090.002). Raw deletion loads in Gwt samples ranged from 13.3 to 45.4 deletions per Mbp mapped to the mtDNA reference (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). On average, Gwt muscle (  n  \u2009=\u200919) has a higher mtDNA deletion load than cultured HEK cells (  n  \u2009=\u20093), but not significantly so (29\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 Mbp  versus 32\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 Mbp ; \u00b1\u2009SD; two-tailed Welch\u2019s   t   test   p  \u2009=\u20090.30). Gvar samples showed higher average deletion loads (59\u2009\u00b1\u200923\u00a0Mbp , versus wild type muscle   p  \u2009<\u200910 ), but the variance is so high that 40% of Gvar samples had deletion loads lower than the highest Gwt sample. After correcting deletion load for deletant molecule size and renormalizing for differential mapping efficiencies across the mtDNA reference, the resulting deletion frequencies and missing arc lengths can be combined to estimate the degree of mtDNA lost to deletions. We define this degree as the mtDNA ablation level. Low mtDNA ablation in HEK cells may be due to mitophagy and purifying selection in an actively dividing culture. Ab initio, it is unclear what fraction of HEK deletions are artifactual, but the high rates of small deletions are in accord with known Illumina error rates. Therefore, taking the most conservative stance from this point forward, all deletion frequencies have the mean HEK frequencies subtracted (see Methods for calculations; a frequency floor is set at 0). A renormalized depth plot shows the remaining mtDNA (Fig.\u00a0 b). The area above each curve represents the mtDNA ablation level.\n   \nDeletion frequencies and ablation levels of mtDNA vary with age, disease, and mapped location.   a  \u2013  e   Gwt muscle samples are represented by triangles, and Gvar samples are represented by circles. Among wild type samples, one young and one aged sample are highlighted (M03, biopsied at 23\u2009years, in black and M17, biopsied at 83\u2009years, in red, respectively).   a   Among Gwt muscle samples, deletion loads are independent of age (per Mbp mapped to mtDNA reference).   b   The fraction of mtDNA remaining for two Gwt and two Gvar samples. A linearized mtDNA map (see Fig.\u00a0 a) is shown above the graph with key features indicated:   oriL   (green); 7S-DNA 3\u2032-end (red); minor arc (magenta); and major arc (teal).   c   Ablation (area above the curve in   b  ) depends upon age, as seen in Gwt samples.   d   Ablation at biopsy is higher and more varied among Gvar samples. Ablation increases with age between well-spaced Gvar samples: A467T;A467T (dark blue); and heterozygous Y955C (purple).   e   The minimum estimated ablation at onset in Gvar samples exceeds the maximum observed ablation at biopsy in Gwt samples, implying a threshold for clinical symptoms (dashed line).   f   A deletion length spectrum example (1\u2009bp bins; Gvar sample M24). Very large deletions (>\u200915\u00a0kbp) may indicate insertions, primarily within the control region. For all samples, see LostArc Reports in Supplemental Information (also see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figs. S4 and S5). Major and minor arc sizes are shown below the histogram (teal and magenta).   g   Deletion length spectra (400\u2009bp bins) for Gwt and variant (A467T;A467T) samples of similar ages \n  \n\nAblation is nonuniform with respect to biopsy age in Gwt muscle samples (Fig.\u00a0 c; Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1;   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test). On average, samples biopsied before age 40 have higher and more varied ablation (0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14%, \u00b1\u200995% CL,   n  \u2009=\u20096) than those from age 40 to 73 (0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.059%,   n  \u2009=\u20097; two-tailed Welch\u2019s   t   test   p  \u2009=\u20090.036). Ablation increases linearly after age 60 (Fig.\u00a0 c;   n  \u2009=\u200910,   R  \u2009=\u20090.84;   p  \u2009<\u20090.0002, based on one million simulations with observed population variance). \n\n\n### Higher ablation is associated with pathogenic POLG variants \n  \nAblation levels in Gvar muscles are higher and more varied than in Gwt muscles (Fig.\u00a0 d). Gvar ablation ranges from 2.3% ablation (M31, biopsy at 62\u2009years) to 23% (M28, biopsy at 42\u2009years). Samples from similarly aged patients (<\u200910\u2009years difference at biopsy) with identical   POLG   genotypes have similar ablation levels (Fig.\u00a0 d; A467T;W748S, 2.3 to 2.9% ablation; A467T;T251I/P587L, 5.7 to 5.4%). Samples from patients with identical   POLG   genotypes but disparate ages (>\u200920\u2009years) show ablation increasing with age (Fig.\u00a0 d; heterozygous Y955C,   n  \u2009=\u20092; A467T;A467T,   n  \u2009=\u20093, linear trend,   R  \u2009=\u20090.988). This suggests three nonexclusive   POLG  -dependent possibilities: (1) deletions accumulate over time, (2) the deletion rate increases with age, and/or (3) the deletion removal rate decreases with age. \n\nRegardless of the mechanism, it follows that the ablation level must have been lower at the age of onset of symptoms than at the later age of biopsy for each muscle sample (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). We have attempted to estimate the levels of ablation at the age of onset of symptoms. The ablation versus time trends for the A467T;A467T and heterozygous Y955C data sets have different slopes, which imply either different ablation levels at birth or nonlinear accumulation in youth (Fig.\u00a0 d). Therefore, as a simple first approximation, ablation at onset was calculated by linear interpolation between 0% at birth and the measured ablation level at the age of biopsy (Fig.\u00a0 e). The minimum calculated ablation at disease onset (1.3% for M31) barely exceeds the maximum among Gwt samples (1.1% for 86-year-old M18). This threshold separating Gwt from Gvar is delineated in Fig.\u00a0 c-e (dashed line). \n\n\n### Ablation patterns implicate replication and lack of mitophagy in deletion accumulation \n  \nInspection of ablation patterns reveals the conspicuous retention of certain genomic features. Young Gwt samples show roughly uniform ablation. However,   oriL   and the 7S-DNA sequence are strongly preserved in Gvar and older Gwt muscles (Fig.\u00a0 b), suggesting these features may be either inherently refractory to deletion or benefit from positive selection. Absent a rational explanation for these DNA sequences to preclude deletion, we prefer a model in which these features are necessary for a deleted species to become detectable within the sample population. Because both   oriL   and the 3\u2032end of the 7S-DNA (7S-3\u2032) are considered replication origins in some mtDNA replication models, the ability to propagate deletant genomes may be essential. In contrast, deletions are frequently observed in genes that support electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Although mitophagy culls mitochondria that cannot maintain membrane potential [ ], the failure to more fully retain these OXPHOS sequences implies incomplete or absent mitophagy in postmitotic muscle fibers. \n\n\n### Ablation correlates with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency \n  \nThe degree to which deletions affect individual mitochondrial systems may be estimated by mapping ablation across the mtDNA reference map (Fig.\u00a0 a) and then may be compared with observed phenotypes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S3). First, we assume mitochondria within a muscle fiber are able to share gene products and metabolites through fusion dynamics and inter-mitochondrial complementation [ \u2013 ]. Second, whereas very frequent deletions must occupy multiple fibers (see the \u201c \u201d), infrequent deletions may also do so. For example, identical rare mtDNA deletions in neighboring fibers could originate early in muscle development, or through fusions with a shared myosatellite lineage, or through independent events at a deletion hotspot. The most conservative estimate of deletion-driven deficiency comes from treating all mitochondria in all fibers as a single pool with evenly distributed deletions and perfect metabolic complementation (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : LostArc Reports for individual samples; examples in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figs. S4 and S5). Ablation of mitochondrial systems, individually and in multiplicative combinations, was compared with histological estimates of the fraction of fibers lacking cytochrome   c   oxidase (Complex IV) activity (COX-deficient fibers (COX-ve) %; Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). The best correlation, explaining 74.5% of COX-ve variation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S3a;   p  \u2009<\u200910 ,   F  -test of least squares linear regression), was produced by considering deletion of COX genes and transcriptional/translational machinery (tRNA genes, rRNA genes, promoters and terminators; Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figs. S3a and S3b). \n\n\n### Deletion length spectra vary with age and disease \n  \nDeletion lengths are not distributed uniformly across all possible sizes. An example deletion length spectrum for sample M24 is shown in Fig.\u00a0 f (66\u2009years at biopsy;   POLG   A467T;S933R). Small deletions (<\u2009100\u2009bp) are very frequent in all samples (see Additional file  : LostArc Reports for all samples). Since small deletions are markedly more frequent in muscle samples than in HEK cultures, they are included in overall deletion load and ablation calculations after HEK background subtraction (as in Fig.\u00a0 a). However, since small insertions and deletions are also the most frequent artifact of short-read sequencing technologies (e.g., [ ]), they were excluded from position- or context-specific calculations unless otherwise noted. Most other deletions are confined by the minor and major arcs, respectively (magenta and teal in Fig.\u00a0 b and f). Very large deletions are also observed (>\u200915\u00a0kbp). These are discussed below. \n\nIn Gwt samples, since mtDNA ablation increases linearly after age 60 (Fig.\u00a0 c;   n  \u2009=\u200910,   R  \u2009=\u20090.84), but deletion loads are independent of age (Fig.\u00a0 a), then deletion sizes (e.g., M24 in Fig.\u00a0 f) must change instead. Age-related trends in deletion length spectra are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 g by the three homozygous   POLG   A467T samples and three age-matched Gwt samples (22 to 68\u2009years at biopsy). The youngest sample in each set exhibits the most uniform deletion length spectrum. Large deletions are less frequent in middle-aged versus younger wild type samples, but such deletions become more frequent with further age and/or   POLG   disease, especially within the major arc size range (e.g., Fig.\u00a0 g). Many deletions are so long that they must eliminate either   oriL   or the 7S-3\u2032. These may represent large populations of non-replicating mtDNA circles in the oldest wild type muscle samples. These deletion length spectra are broadly representative (see Additional file  : LostArc Reports for individual spectra). \n\n\n### Deletion sequence contexts change with age and disease \n  \nDeletions were cataloged by length, frequency of occurrence, position within the genome, and for the presence and length of terminal microhomology (TMH). TMH is defined here as small patches of identical DNA sequence that could support relocation of nascent DNA primers between deletion termini. This classification relies entirely on sequence complementarity and is agnostic to the directionality of potential deletion mechanisms. \n\nThe degree of TMH differs with age and   POLG   genotype. The 19 Gwt samples were divided by age into four cohorts in 20-year increments, counting down from 100\u2009years, and then frequencies of deletions of at least 20\u2009bp were averaged (Fig.\u00a0 a; individual samples in Additional file  : LostArc Reports). The following differences are significant (at   \u03b1  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05; Welch\u2019s   t   test with \u0160id\u00e1k correction for multiple hypothesis testing): deletions with 0\u20133\u2009bp of TMH are more frequent after 80\u2009years, deletions with 4\u20139\u2009bp of TMH are more frequent before 40\u2009years, and deletions with \u2265\u200910\u2009bp of TMH are more frequent after 80\u2009years than between 41 and 80\u2009years. In the youngest cohort, deletion frequencies are relatively uniform regardless of TMH length. In each of eleven Gwt samples, including the seven youngest, over 80% of deletions have at least one base pair of TMH. Only one Gvar sample has such a high proportion of deletions with TMH (M33; 71\u2009years at biopsy, heterozygous   POLG   G952R). In contrast, in the 41\u201360-year Gwt cohort, deletions with TMH of either \u2264\u20092\u2009bp or \u2265\u200910\u2009bp begin to dominate the deletion pool. These species continue to increase in frequency in older cohorts, and deletions with \u2264\u20092\u2009bp TMH outpace deletions with \u2265\u200910\u2009bp TMH. Less than half of the deletions have any TMH in each of the two oldest Gwt samples and in 15 of 22 Gvar samples. As in Gwt samples, the fraction of deletions with \u2265\u200910\u2009bp of TMH increases with age among the three homozygous   POLG   A467T samples. Therefore, the proportion of deletions with TMH decreases with both age and   POLG   defects.\n   \nSize, position, frequency, and context of mtDNA deletions.   a   Frequencies of \u2265\u200920\u2009bp deletions by Gwt age cohort and colored by degree of terminal microhomology (TMH; red to blue for 0 to 9\u2009bp; green for \u2265\u200910\u2009bp). TMH refers to identical sequences found in one deletion terminus and in the region flanking the other terminus. For simplicity, error bars (standard error) are only shown for 0, 5, and \u2265\u200910\u2009bp of TMH.   b  \u2013  d   Example visualizations of deletion frequencies by subsets of size, position, frequency, and sequence context (Gvar sample M24) with versions of the mtDNA map (  b   linear;   c  ,   d   circular). The 7S-3\u2032 terminus and   oriL   are indicated by red and green arrows.   b   A Bubble Map of deletions by terminal positions. Termini are classified starting from the center of a deletion (see inset diagram): one terminus lies in the light strand 5\u2032-direction (red) and the other lies in the heavy strand 5\u2032-direction (blue). Bubble area scaled by deletion frequency and colored by surrounding repeat tract (gray) or by the length of TMH: 0\u2009bp (red); 1\u20139\u2009bp (blue); \u2265\u200910\u2009bp (green). The diagonal contains deletions of under 100\u2009bp (peak in Fig.\u00a0 f). Minor and major arc deletions fall in the magenta and cyan areas (broad overlaid ranges of peaks in Fig.\u00a0 f). Plots equivalent to   b   may be found for all samples in Additional file  : LostArc Reports (also see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figs. S4 and S5).   c   An Arc Map with data as in   b  . Line width and transparency code for frequency (see deletion frequency key). Colors code for deletion size and terminal homology (see Length/homology key). Note the paucity of extensive TMH. The thin green arc from positions 8471 to 13,447 has been termed the common deletion.   d   As per   c  , but colors code for the degree of deletion terminus clustering (see Terminal Cluster key). Plots equivalent to   c  ,   d   may be found for Gvar samples in Supplemental LostArc Arc Maps \n  \n\n\n### Visualizing the size, position, frequency, and context of mtDNA deletions \n  \nMtDNA deletions are uniquely identified by two points in the circular genome. To remain unbiased about the directionality of deletion formation, we chose to define the boundaries of each deletion as the positions of the last missing bases in the light-strand 5\u2032-direction (LS5\u2032) and the heavy-strand 5\u2032-direction (HS5\u2032; Fig.\u00a0 b inset; red and blue, respectively). Individual deletion locations are displayed here in two ways: Bubble Maps (example in Fig.\u00a0 b; all samples in Additional file  : LostArc Reports) and Arc Maps (examples in Fig.\u00a0 c, d; all samples in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Arc Maps). In practice, we find circular Arc Maps more intuitive for visualizing some features (e.g., deletions that cross the control region, terminus clustering) and linear Bubble Plots more useful for other purposes (e.g., combining deletion length, position, TMH, and frequency in one plot). \n\nBecause few deletions traverse position 1 within the control region of mtDNA, the vast majority of deletions localize to the upper left half on Bubble Maps (e.g., M24; Fig.\u00a0 b). Across all samples, most deletions are further confined either to a narrow zone near the diagonal or to one of two triangular zones that are bounded by   oriL   (green arrow) and the 7S-DNA termini (7S-3\u2032 red arrow). Deletions near the diagonal are small and often located within repeat tracts. This included the most frequent deletions, those within long poly-C-runs in the control region (large gray circles at positions 303 and 16,184), the lengths of which are highly polymorphic within the human population (MitoMap [ ]). These poly-C-run deletions cause the deep, narrow ablation valleys at the extreme left and right edges of the ablation map (Fig.\u00a0 b), the narrow red spikes near the top of the Length/homology Arc Map (Fig.\u00a0 c), and the small deletion peak in the deletion length spectrum (\u2264\u2009100\u2009bp, Fig.\u00a0 f). Deletions in the two triangular Bubble Map zones are confined to the minor and major arcs (Fig.\u00a0 b, magenta and cyan, respectively) and are responsible for the wide peaks in deletion length spectra (Fig.\u00a0 f) and the wide troughs in the ablation map (Fig.\u00a0 b). A small cluster of deletions in the upper left of the Bubble Map includes most of the very large deletions (>\u200915\u00a0kbp; Fig.\u00a0 f). However, when mapped to a circular reference sequence, split reads from the junctions of very large deletions are indistinguishable from those of insertions that exceed the read length. If these are truly large deletions, rather than insertions, then the remaining DNA would consist of micro-circles that include most of the control region and, usually, all of the 7S-DNA sequence. These large deletions appear as small blue arcs that straddle the gray 7S-DNA near the top of the Length/homology Arc Map (Fig.\u00a0 c). Other potential large deletions are visible either directly below the diagonal or in the white rectangular zone in the upper left portion of high-resolution versions of the Bubble Map (Fig.\u00a0 b). These are very rare mtDNA species that lack one or more potential replication origins. \n\nBubble Maps for other muscle samples differ in detail but are similar overall (see Additional file  : LostArc Reports). Five of the six Gwt samples under age 40 have few off-diagonal (i.e., large) deletions that are frequent enough to be easily visible at reasonable resolution (exception: M05). Bubble Maps for Gwt samples between the ages of 40 and 80 are dominated by deletions in the major arc. A deletion spanning positions 8471 to 13,447 is often visible in these samples (Fig.\u00a0 b, green circle; Fig.\u00a0 c, green arc). This 4977\u2009bp deletion is flanked by 13 nucleotide direct repeat sequences and is often referred to as the \u201ccommon deletion\u201d [ ]. This deletion appears in most samples, generally at frequencies under 10 . This is never the most frequent deletion (see control region poly-C-runs) and is rarely the most frequent deletion of over 20\u2009bp (2 of 22 Gvars, 8 of 19 Gwt samples). \n\nAll Gvar Bubble Maps show a dense horizontal line of deletions with HS5\u2032-termini at around position 16,070 near the 7S-3\u2032 on the reference map. We call such a Bubble Map feature a deletion ridge. These deletions extend unidirectionally from the 7S-3\u2032 into the major arc. Bubble Map deletion ridges appear as highly colored arc fountains in Terminal Cluster Arc Maps, such as the blue fountain issuing from near the 7S-3\u2032 in the M24 example (Fig.\u00a0 d). Twenty of 22 Gvars (exceptions: M34 and M33) have a second, vertical deletion ridge with LS5\u2032-termini near   oriL   at around position 5780. These deletions extend unidirectionally from   oriL   into the major arc. The corresponding red Terminal Cluster fountain is very faint for M24 (Fig.\u00a0 d). A clearer example, M38, is discussed later. Other deletions occur with decreasing frequencies as their termini venture farther from these two ridges/fountains. This apparent frequency gradient is punctuated by individual high frequency deletions at sites with extensive TMH, of which the common deletion is one example. \n\nParticular samples have idiosyncratic features. For instance, M24 has, by far, the most frequent minor arc deletions, most of which emanate between positions 400 and 600\u2009bp (Fig.\u00a0 b; Fig.\u00a0 d, pink fountains). Many of these deletions eliminate common PCR priming sites, such as the   MT-ND1   qPCR site used in the current work. Studies attempting to quantify mtDNA deletions through PCR from such sites would miss the most drastic effect on M24, the loss of components from at least 20% of its ribosomes (Additional file  : LostArc Reports). Note the deletion from positions 537 to 4430, which by itself removes   MT-ND1   and both mt-rRNA genes from over 2% of mtDNA circles (Fig.\u00a0 b largest green circle; Fig.\u00a0 c, thickest green-yellow arc). At least 10 of 17 Gvar samples (depending on thresholds) have a third ridge/fountain with HS5\u2032-termini in the major arc around position 13.9\u00a0kbp (horizontal, within the   MT-ND5   gene). One member of this group has at least three additional unique ridges/fountains, including one in the minor arc (M40, 35\u2009years at biopsy, heterozygous   POLG   Y955C). Another has an unusually high frequency of very large deletions below the Bubble Map diagonal (M28, 42\u2009years at biopsy,   POLG   A467T;R1096C). \n\n\n### Unsupervised exploratory analysis of mtDNA deletion patterns separates samples by age and POLG genotype \n  \nThe Bubble and Arc Plots show that deletion size, position, and frequency vary with age and disease state in diverse and complex ways. Therefore, in an attempt to uncover basic mechanisms of mtDNA deletion, we undertook unsupervised exploratory analyses to search for previously hidden patterns in the mtDNA deletion datasets (see Methods). \n\nHierarchical clustering of muscle samples by the Euclidean distance between their deletion patterns separates diseased samples from unafflicted. One Gwt (blue) and two Gvar (orange) clades were recovered (Fig.\u00a0 a). Wild type samples were monophyletic (WT clade) and arranged roughly by age. The youngest samples clustered tightly, indicating a high degree of similarity. For older samples, branch lengths and the branching order roughly followed increasing age, suggesting a gradual shift away from some underlying youthful pattern. Gvar samples are paraphyletic. Some have deletion patterns that are more like the WT clade than they are like other Gvars. One Gvar clade contains all three samples with a   POLG   W748S allele and eight of eleven samples with at least one A467T allele, including all three homozygous   POLG   A467T samples. This sister to the WT clade is dubbed the AT-WS clade. The other variant clade contains eight out of ten samples that have the 13.9\u00a0kbp terminal ridge/fountain major arc feature and four of five samples with a   POLG   T251I/P587L allele, and so is dubbed the TI-PL clade. Two Gvar samples have underlying deletion patterns so divergent that they lay outside these three clades. M24 is the only Gvar with extensive minor arc deletions, and M33 is the only Gvar with extensive TMH and neither   oriL   nor 7S-3\u2032 deletion \u201cfountains.\u201d The only other Gvar sample lacking the   oriL   fountain is both the oldest and the most diverged member of the AT-WS clade (M34, 70\u2009years at biopsy; L411P;R574Q).\n   \nUnsupervised exploratory analysis of mtDNA deletion patterns. Hierarchical clustering revealed similarities between samples and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the underlying patterns that explain the most variation between samples. Both analyses used the fraction of deletions, binned by terminus positions (80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 bins), rather than deletion frequencies or mtDNA ablation levels. Deletions of <\u200940\u2009bp and deletions mapped to the T-shaped white region (  b  ,   c  ) were excluded as possible false positives (see Methods).   a   Hierarchical clustering by Euclidean distance separates samples into three clades. Gwt samples form a WT clade and sort largely by age at biopsy (black to red; see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). Gvar samples are \u201cparaphyletic,\u201d i.e., some have patterns that are more like Gwts (AT-WS clade) than like other Gvars (TI-PL clade). Colored squares below the dendrogram indicate   POLG   genotypes, with ablation levels shown below. Similar Gvar genotypes tend to cluster. Purple bars below the dendrogram illustrate ablation levels.   b  ,   c   A representative subset of Gvar samples was used for PCA (see the \u201c \u201d section): all Gwts; AT-WS and TI-PL clade representatives; and cladeless sample M24.   b   The 1st PCA component vector (deletion terminus positions as per Fig.\u00a0 b) colored by PCA weight (red to blue for \u2265\u20090.04 to \u2264 \u2212\u20090.04).   c   The 3rd PCA component weight vector.   d  \u2013  g   Samples were scored using PCA weights. Black curves are parabolas fit to Gwt data (  R   inset).   d   The 1st component distinguishes Gwt (triangles) from Gvar deletion patterns, except M24 (orange diamond with black border).   e   3rd component scores correlate with age at biopsy, regardless of   POLG   disease state.   f   These two components separate Gwt and Gvar clusters by deletion pattern (na\u00efve to disease, age, and overall deletion frequency).   g   The 2nd PCA component was spent describing unique features of the disease state M24. In order to display minor arc features, the vectors in   b  ,   c   were recalculated without M24 \n  \n\nThough the hierarchical clustering relied only upon normalized deletion fractions, the clades that it generated also differ by mtDNA ablation level and histology. The TI-PL clade has a significantly higher average ablation level (13.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5%; \u00b1\u2009CL 95%;   n  \u2009=\u20098) than the AT-WS clade (5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3%;   n  \u2009=\u200912;   p  \u2009=\u20090.0021, Student\u2019s   t   test), which in turn has significantly higher ablation than the WT clade (0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.145%;   n  \u2009=\u200919;   p  \u2009=\u20090.00024). This trend is parallel with the ranking of COX-ve fractions (TI-PL at 18.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8%\u2009>\u2009AT-WS at 10.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1%\u2009>\u2009WT at 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5%;   p  \u2009=\u20090.017 and 0.00026, respectively). The deepest branching member of the TI-PL clade, sample M36, is exceptional by many measures, making its inclusion debatable. Within the TI-PL clade, M36 is the youngest sample (17\u2009years versus 42 to 80), has the lowest fraction of deletions with TMH (51%), and has the lowest COX-ve fraction (3% versus 13\u201330%). Without M36, the COX-ve difference between the TI-PL and AT-WS clades is more significant (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0014). \n\n\n### Deletion patterns have separable age- and disease-associated components \n  \nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of a data set and isolates independent trends (components) that explain the most variation within the data. Each component may be expressed as a weight vector (Fig.\u00a0 b, c) which results in a score when applied to an individual sample (Fig.\u00a0 d, e, and g). A higher component score suggests greater contribution of an underlying process to the final deletion pattern. \n\nThe primary (1st; Fig.\u00a0 b) and tertiary (3rd; Fig.\u00a0 c) principal components focus on deletions within the major arc. The 1st component accounts for the greatest variability among deletion patterns and neatly separates Gwt from Gvar patterns (Fig.\u00a0 d). Because 1st component scores are higher for Gvar samples (0.047 to 0.105, excluding M24) than for Gwt samples (\u2212\u20090.028 to 0.007), we consider the 1st component vector to be the disease-like axis of the deletion pattern dataset. First component weights are maximal near   oriL   and the 7S-3\u2032 (i.e., the most common deletion fountains) and decrease more or less smoothly with distance from those features (Fig.\u00a0 b). Among Gwt samples, 1st component scores increase slightly with age at biopsy (cohorts as in Fig.\u00a0 b). It is unclear what function should model this relationship, but an arbitrary parabolic fit explains the majority of score variation with age (  R  \u2009=\u20090.64). This sub-trend suggests the disease-like mechanism within the 1st component could be contributing to the accumulation of deletions in aging Gwt muscles. Also, these deletions have little TMH, implying much of the observed increase in low TMH deletions with age (Fig.\u00a0 a) may be influenced by the 1st component. \n\nThe 3rd component has positive weights for deletion termini scattered about the major arc with bins near origins mostly penalized (Fig.\u00a0 c). Third component scores generally increase with age at biopsy, regardless of   POLG   genotype (Fig.\u00a0 e). Because the oldest sample (Gwt M19, 93\u2009years at biopsy) has the highest 3rd component score, we consider the 3rd component vector to be the aging-like axis of the deletion pattern dataset. An arbitrary parabolic fit explains most of the Gwt score variation with biopsy age (  R  \u2009=\u20090.88). For reasons unknown, parabolas fit to 1st and 3rd component scores have similar age minima (32.1 and 31.8\u2009years at biopsy, respectively). More Gwt samples would help to determine the true functions underlying these curves, assuming that PCA scores remain stable in a larger dataset. Also, the deletions that dominate 3rd component scores have extensive TMH, so the observed increase in TMH-rich deletions with age (Fig.\u00a0 a) may be highly influenced by mechanisms underlying this 3rd component aging axis of the deletion dataset. \n\nWhile 1st and 3rd component scores separate samples by Gvar state (Fig.\u00a0 f), Gvar sample M24 behaves like a Gwt sample along these axes. The 2nd component (Fig.\u00a0 g) is dedicated to the frequent minor arc deletions that distinguish M24 from all other samples (see Fig.\u00a0 b\u2013d; note M24 exclusion from clades in Fig.\u00a0 a), which limits its explanatory power to that sample. Idiosyncratic components like this were the impetus for confining PCA to a subset of representative samples (see Methods). \n\n\n### Deletion maps support a strand displacement mode of mtDNA replication \n  \nSeveral alternative modes of mtDNA replication have been proposed (reviewed in [ \u2013 ]). We focus here on four of them (Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). Mode 1: in the strand displacement mode (SDM; Fig.\u00a0 a) [ ,  ], nascent heavy-strand replication proceeds unidirectionally and continuously from an initiation site within the control region (oH in Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). The displaced parental heavy strand is partially coated by mitochondrial ssDNA binding protein (mtSSB). After passage of the replication fork, priming occurs at the light-strand replication origin (oL in Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d; presumed to be   oriL   when assigned to a single site) and replication of the nascent light strand proceeds unidirectionally and continuously. Replication of each strand terminates at their respective origins. A subset of RITOLS (RNA incorporated throughout the lagging strand) and Bootlace modes ([ ] and reviewed in [ ]) resemble the SDM except that RNA transcripts assist/replace mtSSB and that the light strand is occasionally primed by a transcript distant from   oriL  . Mode 2: analogous to rolling circle replication proposed for   Caenorhabditis elegans   mtDNA [ ], nascent heavy-strand replication may initiate as in the SDM but continues beyond the control region (oH in Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). Light-strand synthesis initiates from   oriL   (shown here Fig.\u00a0 b) or other possible sites. Later steps resolve the expanding duplex into unit length circles (Fig.\u00a0 b). Mode 3: in unidirectional, strand synchronous replication, analogous to that proposed for   Drosophila   mtDNA [ ], both strands initiate in the control region (oH in Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). The nascent heavy strand is continuously replicated as a classical leading strand and the nascent light strand is discontinuously replicated as a classical lagging strand (Fig.\u00a0 c). A subset of RITOLS [ ] resemble this mode more than the SDM mode. Mode 4: in bidirectional, strand-coupled DNA replication (SCD [ ] and reviewed in [ ]), mtDNA replication is similar to nuclear replication with classical leading and lagging strands and two replication forks per origin. Here, initiation is depicted as occurring in the control region, but some modes allow initiation anywhere in the major arc (i.e.,   oriZ   [ ]), oH is a replication termination site, and there is little or no role for a light-strand origin (i.e.,   oriL  ; Fig.\u00a0 d).\n   \nDeletion maps support a strand displacement mode of mtDNA replication. Deletion patterns were compared to four replication modes.   a  \u2013  d   Heavy and light strands are shown in red and blue, with template strands darker. Arrows indicate 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 synthesis directions. Continuously and discontinuously replicated strands are shown as solid and dashed, respectively. Potential heavy and light strand replication origins (labeled oH and oL) are indicated by triangles (gray when unused). See the \u201c \u201d section for detailed descriptions of the   a   strand displacement mode,   b   the rolling circle mode proposed for   Caenorhabditis elegans   mtDNA,   c   a unidirectional, strand-synchronous mode as proposed for   Drosophila   mtDNA and older RITOLS and Bootlace modes, and   d   strand-coupled DNA replication.   e   Deletion arcs, scaled by individual deletion frequency and colored by terminus frequency in 100\u2009bp bins, cluster near   oriL   and the 3\u2032-terminus of 7S-DNA. See Supplemental Arc Plots for all Gvar samples.   f  \u2013  h   Heavy- and light-strand-5\u2032-terminus frequencies (lighter blue and red; 250\u2009bp bins; excluding deletions with TMH \u2265\u200910\u2009bp) reveal double-bowtie patterns in Gvar and aged Gwt samples (see 1st PCA component in Fig.\u00a0 b). Except in Gwt samples under 65\u2009years of age, these patterns fit replication/deletion Monte Carlo models (darker curves; simulation 6 in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6a).   f   Gvar example M38.   g   Younger Gwt example M03.   h   Older Gwt example M17.   i   Mean deletion lengths, from Monte Carlo regression, increased with age in Gwt (triangles) and Gvar (circles) samples \n  \n\nDeletion termini are not uniformly distributed in Gvar samples, as exemplified by sample M38 (Fig.\u00a0 e; 74\u2009years at biopsy;   POLG   R852C;T251I/P587L). Excluding deletions with TMH over nine bp (associated with the 2nd PCA component), log-scale terminus frequencies resemble a double bowtie (Fig.\u00a0 f; 250\u2009bp bins). One pair of peaks is bounded by the major arc. These peaks represent the recurrent deletion fountains and recapitulate the smooth falloff from origins in the 1st PCA component. The second pair of peaks is bounded by the minor arc. When viewed in this way, samples with significant quantities of deletion termini in the minor arc, such as M24, lie at one extreme in the spectrum of major and minor arc deletion frequencies. The double-bowtie pattern is absent from younger Gwt samples (e.g., M03, 23\u2009years at biopsy, Fig.\u00a0 g) but present in older Gwt samples (e.g., M17, 83\u2009years at biopsy, Fig.\u00a0 h). In fact, the nine oldest wild type samples (65 to 93\u2009years) and one 48-year-old wild type sample (M07) all show the pattern, and these ten samples also have the highest wild type 1st PCA component scores. \n\nThe distribution of deletion termini for a variety of potential deletion mechanisms were modeled in silico. Monte Carlo models simulated the iterative generation of 240,000 deletions in arbitrarily clockwise or counterclockwise directions relative to the reference genome, and the impact of each deletion on selected genomic features was monitored. The 7S-3\u2032 terminus and   oriL   were selected as critical genomic features based on the lack of ablation near replication origins (Fig.\u00a0 b). For replication modes that invoke specific, fixed origins, the 7S-3\u2032 terminus and   oriL   were used in simulations because of their proximity to the sharp transitions of the double-bowtie pattern (Fig.\u00a0 f,h and Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6) and the interplay between replication and deletions implied by the marked amplification of the bowtie pattern in Gvar samples (Fig.\u00a0 f). Small pilot simulations were run for a wide variety of deletion generation schemata which were then winnowed down to six (Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d and Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6a). Each satisfied the following requirements: they must have some basis in proposed mechanisms of deletion generation, they must be able to produce something resembling a bowtie pattern, and they must use no more than five adjustable parameters in order to avoid overfitting. Two selected schemata were independent of mtDNA replication origins, as if deletions were triggered by attempted repair of random strand breaks or non-coding lesions without (sim. 1) or with (sim. 2) a dependence on deletion length. Four simulations (sims. 3\u20136) were based on recovery of replication intermediates generated during previously proposed replication modes. Two (sims. 3 and 4) assume formation of deletions during unidirectional H-strand replication from 7S-3\u2032. One (sim. 3) models deletions initiated during continuous H-strand synthesis as in the original RITOLS/Bootlace synchronous synthesis mode or the first stage of asynchronous replication in either the rolling circle or strand displacement synthesis modes. Another (sim. 4) models deletions formed during original RITOLS/Bootlace DNA mode of synthesis without selection for   oriL  . The last two (sims. 5 and 6) assume deletions arise during synchronous bidirectional replication from 7S-3\u2032 (i.e., strand-coupled synthesis) or during asynchronous unidirectional synthesis from 7S-3\u2032 and   oriL   (i.e., the strand displacement model), respectively. In each iteration, deletion start points were randomly selected from a defined distribution, and endpoints were chosen from a second distribution. Critical genomic features were optionally selected for by removing deletions that impinged upon them from the population with an adjustable probability. The limit on adjustable parameters required that the same parameters be used to simulate deletions in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. \n\nAmong the six Monte Carlo models of potential deletion mechanisms, sim. 6 fit the observed terminus frequencies better than all other models in both aged and diseased samples (Fig.\u00a0 h and f, respectively). Simulation\u00a06, based on deletions made during asynchronous strand displacement replication (Fig.\u00a0 a), produced uniformly higher log-scale   R   values versus observed terminus frequencies for all test samples (mean 0.84, 0.70 and 0.88 for M38, M17 and M25, respectively; M38 and M17 for all simulations in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6). The next best correlations were with simulation 3, which assumed no deletion initiation from   oriL   (mean   R  \u2009=\u20090.81, 0.58 and 0.82 for M38, M17 and M25, respectively). Simulation 6 correlation coefficients were lower for older wild type samples (over 65\u2009years, mean   R  \u2009=\u20090.58;   n  \u2009=\u20098) than for Gvars (mean   R  \u2009=\u20090.78;   n  \u2009=\u200921; e.g., Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6). Samples exhibiting the worst fits for simulation 6 were the two Gvar samples that fell outside the AT-WS and TI-PL disease clades (M24 and M33; Fig.\u00a0 a) and the longest branch within the AT-WS clade (M34; Fig.\u00a0 a; excluding these three, Gvar mean   R  \u2009=\u20090.81). The mean deletion length, one of the parameters optimized in simulation 6, increased with age in both wild type and Gvar samples (Fig.\u00a0 i). Mean simulated deletion lengths are longer than the mean observed lengths, presumably because the simulations account for deletions that were selectively removed from the observed population. In younger Gwt samples, deletion terminus frequencies are explainable as independent termini selected from uniform distributions over the whole mtDNA. Such deletions may freely impinge upon   oriL   and the 7S-3\u2032 terminus. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nMutations in nuclear genes encoding components of the mitochondrial replisome co-segregate with mitochondrial diseases [ ], indicating that faulty mtDNA replication can cause a variety of heritable mitochondrial diseases [ ]. Certain mitochondrial disease symptoms mimic those of natural aging, in particular those associated with skeletal muscle, and improper maintenance of the mitochondrial genome has been implicated as a major driver in the aging process [ ]. Depletion of mtDNA or accumulation of point mutations and deletions in mtDNA directly leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Depletion of mtDNA is linked to early-onset, often fatal mitochondrial diseases [ ,  ]. However, skeletal muscle mtDNA levels vary little with age [ ,  ,  ], and mtDNA copy number did not vary significantly, on average, between Gwt and Gvar samples in this study (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1a for representative values). Although mutations involving substitution of individual base pairs in mtDNA increase with age [ ], they are insufficiently abundant to explain the phenotypes of aging [ ,  ]. Accordingly, mtDNA deletions have been proposed to explain both mitochondrial disease and some aging phenotypes [ ,  \u2013 ]. \n\n### Ultrasensitive mtDNA deletion detection by LostArc \n  \nIf mtDNA deletions are driven by replication, then mapping of mtDNA deletions should help to reveal the underlying causes of mitochondrial dysfunction and help distinguish between alternative modes of mtDNA replication (Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). However, for purposes of sequencing library preparation, human skeletal muscle biopsies (Fig.\u00a0 b, step 1) yield mtDNA in very low quantities and with very low mtDNA to gDNA ratios (Fig.\u00a0 c). In pilot experiments, we, like others before us, found that every round of long-range PCR enrichment of mtDNA inflated the frequencies of random subsets of deletant mtDNA species. To avoid such artifacts, past high-throughput mapping attempts either focused on mtDNA deletions with population frequencies over 10  [ ] or purified targeted deletions via digital drop PCR before library preparation [ ]. The latter found 451 unique deletions in human brain tissue. Recently, one high-throughput study found a remarkable 4489 unique deletions, in the brain and blood, by accepting the flaws of long-range PCR enrichment and eschewing absolute frequency measurements [ ]. LostArc achieves mtDNA enrichment without long-range PCR amplification by selectively degrading linear nuclear DNA with nucleases (Fig.\u00a0 b, steps 2\u20134b). Nextera tagmentation [ ] allowed library preparation from the resulting nanogram level of DNA yields (step 5). Minimal post-tagmentation amplification is still necessary prior to Illumina paired-end sequencing (step 6). Methods for further reducing or eliminating amplification require further study. \n\nThe LostArc pipeline detects deletions by mapping split-reads to a circular mtDNA reference (step 7). Roughly 470,000 unique deletion spans were recovered from skeletal muscle biopsies collected from 19 Gwt individuals and 22 Gvar patients with mitochondrial diseases (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). Roughly 99% of these deletions have not been reported previously [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Deletion counts are converted to frequencies, the background subtracted, and then deletion patterns discovered (steps 8\u201310). The complex deletion patterns within individual samples depend upon both the sample age at biopsy and the   POLG   genotype. \n\n\n### MtDNA deletions during aging \n  \nDeletion frequencies among Gwt samples do not vary significantly with age at biopsy (Fig.\u00a0 a), whereas mtDNA ablation levels increase non-linearly with age (Fig.\u00a0 c). Ablation levels refer to the loss of mtDNA segments through deletion, rather than the loss of entire mtDNA circles through depletion. Although deletions are not evenly distributed around the mtDNA circle in either wild type or Gvar cells, they rarely impinge upon   oriL   and the 3\u2032-end of the 7S-DNA (7S-3\u2032; Fig.\u00a0 b). These regions are putative light- and heavy-strand origins of replication, respectively, in two commonly proposed modes of mtDNA replication (Fig.\u00a0 a. b). If faulty mitochondria were selectively removed within these skeletal muscle samples\u2014the prime function of mitophagy\u2014then genomic features encoding fully functional OXPHOS machinery and its transcription and translation should also be preserved. OXPHOS is clearly impacted in both Gvar and older Gwt samples, as measured by the fraction of fibers lacking COX activity (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). Taken together, these observations have two implications: (1) retention of both   oriL   and the 7S-3\u2032 is important for deletant species to be replicated frequently enough to reach the threshold for detection, which supports the hypothesis that they are initiation sites for strand displacement mtDNA replication, and (2) purifying selection against ablated circles though the process of mitophagy is insufficient to cleanse mtDNA pools, at least in the skeletal muscles of Gvar patients and older wild type individuals. \n\nGvar samples have higher ablation levels than wild type samples (Fig.\u00a0 d). Ablation increases with age in both homozygous   POLG   A467T and heterozygous   POLG   Y955C samples. If Gvar ablation levels are projected back to the age of disease onset, assuming a linear progression starting at zero ablation, then symptoms appear to become clinically relevant when ablation is as low as 1.3%, which exceeds the maximum ablation seen in older Gwt samples (Fig.\u00a0 d\u2013e). Ablation of transcription, translation, and Complex IV machinery can explain roughly 75% of the variation in the fraction of fibers lacking cytochrome c oxidase activity (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S3), which is sufficient to explain some symptoms of age and disease in skeletal muscle. Additional work is needed to determine whether this holds true in brain and other organ systems that are affected by improper mtDNA maintenance. \n\n\n### MtDNA deletion size, patterns, and spectra implicate the strand displacement mode of mtDNA replication \n  \nSize spectra and sequence context of deletions change with age and disease. Excluding deletions under 100\u2009bp, the spectra of deletion sizes in young wild type muscle samples are essentially uniform (Fig.\u00a0 g). However, in Gvar and older Gwt samples, the apparent prohibition on deletions that impinge upon   oriL   and the 7S-3\u2032 constrains deletion sizes (Fig.\u00a0 f, g) and positions (Fig.\u00a0 b\u2013d) to zones within the minor and major arcs. Similarly, lengths of terminal microhomology for deletions in Gwt samples collected by 40\u2009years of age are also uniformly distributed around the genome (Fig.\u00a0 a; Additional file  : LostArc Reports). In contrast, Gvar samples (excluding M33) and older wild type samples have proportionally more deletions with little or no TMH. The frequency of deletions with over 10\u2009bp of TMH increases with age in Gwt samples and is dependent upon   POLG   genotype among variant samples. \n\nThese complex dependencies divide deletions into three general classes with mechanistic implications. Class 1 deletions have low TMH, and formation of this type of deletion would be expected for ligation of DNA termini independent of base-base hydrogen bonding. Class 1 deletions increase in frequency of occurrence with advancing age or disease state (excluding M33). Class 2 deletions have high TMH, and frequent formation of this type of deletion would be expected for primer slippage during replication [ ,  ,  ]. Class 2 deletions become more frequent with age (Fig.\u00a0 a), depending on   POLG   genotype (Additional file  : LostArc Reports). Classes 1 and 2 largely preserve   oriL   and the 7S-3\u2032 terminus (Fig.\u00a0 b, f, and g and Fig.\u00a0 b\u2013d), which implicates asynchronous strand displacement DNA replication initiated from these potential origins (Fig.\u00a0 a, b) in the expansion and perhaps the creation of these deletions. Class 3 deletions do not respect these potential origins of replication, and they are uniformly distributed throughout the genome in young Gwt samples without regard for deletion size or TMH length. Class 3 deletions are expected to form by mechanisms independent of DNA replication [ ,  ,  ]. Mitophagy and other phenotypic selectors for mitochondrial survival are not needed to explain these patterns. \n\nUnsupervised analyses of deletion patterns confirm these classes quantitatively. A principal component analysis recovered two generally applicable components. The first PCA component (Fig.\u00a0 b) separates diseased from wild type samples but increases with age in the latter (Fig.\u00a0 d). This component is dominated by class 1 deletions. Scores for the third PCA component (Fig.\u00a0 c) increase with age, regardless of disease state (Fig.\u00a0 e). This component is dominated by class 2 deletions. Hierarchical clustering confirms that young wild type samples have very similar deletion patterns, but that patterns become more like those seen in diseased samples as age increases (Fig.\u00a0 a). This represents the age-dependent transition from class 3 to classes 1 and 2. Clustering of deletion patterns for similar   POLG   genotypes implies similar mechanisms of deletion formation. Gvar samples separated into two clades. The first clade contains all   POLG   W748S and most A467T alleles. The second, which contains most   POLG   T251I/P587L alleles, differs more from aged wild type patterns. PCA did not recover the difference underlying these divergent clades, likely due to the limited sample counts. This suggests a line of future inquiry as more samples become available for each genotype and for new allelic combinations. \n\nDeletions that underlie the first PCA component, mostly of low-TMH class 1, have termini that cluster near potential origins (Fig.\u00a0 b; e.g., M38, Fig.\u00a0 e). Log-scale deletion terminus frequency maps (Fig.\u00a0 f\u2013h; excluding TMH over 9\u2009bp) vary by age and disease. Younger wild type samples again have a relatively uniform distribution of frequencies around the mtDNA circle (Fig.\u00a0 g). In Gvar and older wild type samples (Fig.\u00a0 f, h), light-strand-5\u2032 termini peak to the right of potential origins (especially   oriL  ) and heavy-strand-5\u2032 termini peak to the left of potential origins (especially the 7S-3\u2032). Because this double-bowtie pattern resembles diagrams of strand-biased mutagenesis and ribonucleotide incorporation that were used to define origin locations and replication strand identity in nuclear genomes (reviewed [ ]), our analysis again strongly implicates mtDNA replication utilizing two origins in the creation and maintenance of mtDNA deletions. \n\nMonte Carlo simulations were performed to test models for deletion formation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6a) that were either independent of DNA replication or dependent on competing modes of mtDNA replication (Fig.\u00a0 a\u2013d). The model that best explained the observed frequencies of deletion termini required unidirectional formation of deletions independently proceeding from each potential origin, followed by selection against deletant species lacking either or both potential origins. The ability to accurately model observed deletion frequencies strongly implicates the strand displacement mode of mtDNA synthesis. A model invoking rolling circle replication (Fig.\u00a0 b) cannot be excluded; however, we discount this mode of replication in human muscle tissue as it has really only been suggested for nematodes and certain yeasts [ ,  ]. Our data also support aspects of the RITOLS/Bootlace replication mechanism (Fig.\u00a0 c), although initiation of replication must be constrained to both origins and we cannot resolve whether the displaced DNA strand is coated with RNA [ ]. \n\nUltrasensitive deletion detection via the LostArc method yielded mtDNA deletion patterns that reveal the links between replication, aging, and mitochondrial disease. Deletion frequency does not correlate with age, but mtDNA ablation is sufficient to explain some symptoms of age and disease, and to approximate a clinical threshold. The patterns suggest little to no mitophagy in post-mitotic skeletal muscle fibers. Deletion sizes, locations, and sequence contexts change with age and disease, and the dependencies between them suggest three simultaneous mechanisms for deletion creation. One mechanism becomes less frequent with age and has features expected for replication-independent deletions, such as ligation of random strand breaks or interruption of DNA repair events. Incomplete degradation of damaged mtDNA [ ] also presents opportunities to form mtDNA deletions with random lengths and positions. The other two mechanisms are synergistic, become more frequent with age, and have features that imply replication dependence. One of these mechanisms appears to be independent of base-base hydrogen bonding, like ligation of termini across large single-stranded gaps during replication. This suggests replication restart, whether by Pol \u03b3 or by another mitochondrially localized primase/polymerase, such as PrimPol [ ,  ]. The other mechanism that increases with age resembles classical primer slippage during replication. Both primer slippage and replication restart could emerge from replication stalling, though why stalling would become more frequent with age is unclear. Myosatellite-mediated repair of muscular damage can introduce new mtDNA through formation of new fibers or fusion with damaged fibers [ \u2013 ]. Perhaps muscular trauma, such as that induced by exercise, is more frequent in younger muscles, leading to repeated dilution of the deletion-bearing population with fresh, myosatellite-derived populations. Differences in physical activity could then explain why some wild type samples look older (M07) or younger (M09) than their biopsy age. Regardless of the initiating event, the patterns underlying deletion frequencies strongly implicate the strand displacement mode of mtDNA synthesis. \n\nThe sensitivity of LostArc creates potential applications beyond basic research, such as genetic screening, diagnostic applications, and medical forensics. For instance, deletion patterns sort different   POLG   genotypes into divergent phylogenetic clades but separating the contributions of different   POLG   alleles will require deeper sampling of each genotype and new allelic combinations. Different components of the mitochondrial replisome may generate different patterns for mtDNA deletions. Availability of variant cell lines or tissue samples expressing disease alleles for Twinkle helicase (  TWNK  ), the Pol \u03b3 accessory subunit (  POLG2  ), or the mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (  SSBP1  ) would allow orthogonal testing of these ideas. While the current study strongly implicates faulty strand displacement replication as the causative agent of the muscular symptoms of aging and   POLG-  derived mitochondrial disease, a complete reckoning must await samples from other tissue types, from longitudinal collections from the same individual, from individuals with different environmental or pharmaceutical exposures or exercise regimes, and from patients with disparate disease phenotypes. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Tissue samples and patient cohort \n  \nWe studied diagnostic   vastus lateralis   (quadriceps) muscle biopsies from 22 patients, biopsied at 17 to 80\u2009years of age, with genetically confirmed Gvars and evidence of multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle that are associated with focal cytochrome   c   oxidase (COX) deficiency (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Tables S1 and S2 for information on clinical presentation and histopathological mitochondrial changes observed in the muscle). Quadriceps muscle biopsy samples from patients, aged 17 to 93\u2009years with no evidence of clinical mitochondrial disease, were obtained either during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) operations (  n  \u2009=\u20099; aged 17 to 52\u2009years) or post-mortem (  n  \u2009=\u20099; aged 65 to 93\u2009years), with one exception (below). This study was approved and performed under the ethical guidelines issued by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Research Ethics Committees (reference 09/H0906/75) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. One additional non-malignant muscle sample (M11; aged between 64 and 68\u2009years) was obtained from the University of North Carolina Pathology during a left medial thigh mass biopsy (only normal tissue was used). \n\n\n### Histopathological and molecular genetic studies \n  \nCryostat sections (10\u2009\u03bcm) were cut from transversely orientated muscle blocks and subjected to diagnostic histopathological protocols including COX, SDH, and sequential COX-SDH histochemistry [ ]. The presence of mitochondrial DNA rearrangements was investigated using validated long-range PCR [ ] and quantitative real-time assays [ ]. The presence of pathogenic Gvars was confirmed either by candidate screening of all coding exons and intronic regions of the   POLG   gene (NM_002693), or the application of a massively parallel sequencing strategy using a custom, targeted Ampliseq gene panel covering 18 genes implicated in human disorders of mtDNA maintenance. Where necessary, all Gvars identified by next generation sequencing were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. \n\n\n### Long-range PCR \n  \nLong-range PCR was carried out using human mitochondrial DNA primers targeting the 5\u2032 end starting at bp position 10\u201340 and in the 3\u2032 direction position 16,496\u201316,465 [ ]. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs, Inc., catalog # E0553S) was used to amplify the 16.5\u2009kb amplicon per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Seventy-five nanograms of gDNA was used as the template in a 50-\u03bcl PCR reaction. Cycling conditions were as follows: hold cycle at 98\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, followed by 34\u2009cycles consisting of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s and 70\u2009\u00b0C for 6.5\u2009min, and extended at 70\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and upon completion held at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Amplicons were run on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. \n\n\n### Control plasmid generation \n  \nHuman mitochondrial DNA was amplified using 75\u2009ng DNA from HEK cell gDNA with New England Biolab\u2019s Phusion polymerase (catalog # M0530S). The primers used were, in NC_012920 coordinates, mtDNA 9318F (cac tcc ata acg ctc ctc ata c) and mtDNA 13370R (cga ccc gga gca cat aaa tag). The amplification protocol was as follows: 98\u2009\u00b0C hold for 30\u2009s, followed by 30\u2009cycles consisting of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 2.5\u2009min, followed by extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and holding at 4\u2009\u00b0C. To confirm the appropriate size of the mtDNA fragments, the amplicons were run on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The 4052\u2009bp mtDNA amplicon was purified using Qiagen\u2019s PCR clean up kit (catalog # 28104). The purified mtDNA fragment was A-tailed using Taq DNA polymerase and sub-cloned into TOPO pCR 2.1 vector (ThermoFisher Scientific TOPO-TA Cloning kit, catalog # 451641) per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Miniprep plasmid DNA was isolated from single colonies using Qiagen\u2019s Miniprep kit (catalog # 27106). The plasmids were Sanger sequenced to verify the human mtDNA sequence. \n\nA series of endonucleases were used to generate control plasmids with deletions. A sample of control plasmid DNA (4\u2009\u03bcg) was cut with HpaI (New England Biolabs Inc., Catalog # R0105S) to generate a 2392\u2009bp deletion between positions 10,014\u201312,405. A second deletion plasmid was generated using BseRI (New England Biolabs Inc., Catalog # R0581S), which cut at positions 9323 and 12,974 to generate a 3652\u2009bp deletion. A third control plasmid generated by using PmeI and NdeI (New England Biolabs Inc., Catalog # R0560S and R0111S), which cut at positions 10,419 and 10,722, respectively (304\u2009bp deletion). A Klenow (New England Biolabs Inc., Catalog # M0210S) reaction was used to fill the overhang generated from NdeI, and a blunt end ligation reaction was performed to join the ends. All of the remaining plasmid DNA was agarose gel purified and eluted with 100\u2009\u03bcL of 1X T4 ligation buffer with dNTPs. Two microliters of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs Inc., Catalog # M0201S) was added and the reaction incubated at 16\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The ligated plasmids were then transformed, miniprep DNA was generated and the sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing. \n\n\n### Genomic DNA isolation \n  \nGenomic DNA was isolated (Fig.\u00a0 b) from either approximately 25\u2009mg of frozen skeletal muscle tissue or 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910  cultured HEK cells using the Qiagen\u2019s QiAmp kit (catalog # 51304). Frozen tissue samples were minced with a razor blade by hand on a disposable sterile surface. After adding 20\u2009\u03bcl of proteinase K (600\u00a0mAU/mL solution or 40 mAU/mg protein), the tissue and cell lysates were incubated at 55\u2009\u00b0C overnight. The remainder of the protocol followed Qiagen\u2019s recommendations. The concentration of gDNA was determined using Invitrogen\u2019s Qubit Fluorimeter. \n\nIn pilot experiments, immediately following genomic DNA isolation, technical replicate samples spiked with plasmid standards containing mtDNA sequence with artificial deletion junctions did not change the apparent frequencies of other deletant species (e.g., sample M22; Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S2a, b, d, and e). Calculated control plasmid frequencies recapitulated input frequencies (  R  \u2009=\u20090.943, or 0.940 if the intercept is set to the origin) regardless of plasmid sizes (~\u20094.2\u20137.5\u00a0kbp), deletion sizes (304\u20133652\u2009bp), input concentrations (10 \u201310 ), or the sample milieu (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S2c). Frequencies of individual deletions correlate well between DNA and tissue subsamples (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S2d and e; slopes and   R   values very near 1). Together, these demonstrate LostArc\u2019s sensitivity, accuracy, and lack of bias. \n\n\n### mtDNA enrichment \n  \nThe following endonucleases were pooled in equal volumes, to final concentrations recommended by the manufacturer: AgeI, DraIII, FspI, PshAI, PspXI, SexAI, XmaI, and ExoV (New England Biolabs Inc.). The pooled endonucleases offered 1.77\u2009\u00d7\u200910  additional cuts to gDNA that provided more ends for the ExoV reaction that followed. Exonuclease digests were set up with 0.2 to 2.0\u2009\u03bcg of human skeletal muscle gDNA, 10X NEB Buffer 4, 10\u2009mM ATP, 4\u2009\u03bcL of pooled endonucleases, and water to a final volume of 60\u2009\u03bcL. Reactions were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for ExoV reactions. Following heat inactivation for 30\u2009min at 70\u2009\u00b0C, a 60-\u03bcL ExoV only reaction without gDNA was added to the same tube and incubated for 24\u2009h. ExoV treatment was for 72\u2009h, with the daily addition of a complete ExoV reaction (60\u2009\u03bcL) to avoid the accumulation of glycerol and salt that may inhibit in the reaction. Following the mtDNA enrichment, the reaction was again heat inactivated for 30\u2009min at 70\u2009\u00b0C. The reactions were column purified using Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, catalog # D4013), per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Enriched mtDNA was eluted with ddH 0, and the concentration of the DNA was determined using Invitrogen\u2019s Qubit Fluorimeter. \n\n\n### Real-time PCR \n  \nReal-Time PCR was used to quantify the relative amount of mtDNA in each sample following mtDNA enrichment. Fluorescently labeled probes and primers targeting the nuclear gene   RPPH1   for normalization purposes and the mitochondrial target   MT-ND1   were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (catalog #\u2018s 4426961 and 4331182, respectively). Target amplicons were TA-cloned using Invitrogen\u2019s TOPO TA-cloning kit (catalog # 451641), and then verified with Sanger sequencing. The cloned targets were used as positive controls, to generate standard curves to enable relative quantitation of mtDNA copy number of enriched samples. Real-Time PCR amplifications were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) with a cycling protocol consisting of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and 40\u2009cycles at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. All reactions were done in triplicate, and 100\u2009pg of enriched mitochondrial DNA was used in each reaction. Each 20\u2009\u03bcL reaction used TaqMan 2X Universal Mix (Applied Biosystems, catalog # 4324018). \n\n\n### Tagmentation \n  \nDNA libraries for next-generation sequencing were prepared with the Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) using genomic DNA enriched for mitochondrial DNA. Each DNA sample was diluted to a final concentration of 1.0\u2009ng/\u03bcL, and a total of 1\u2009ng was used to prepare each library. Ten microliters of Tagment DNA Buffer were added to 1\u2009ng of each DNA sample, and then 9\u2009\u03bcL of Amplicon Tagment Mix was added and mixed thoroughly. The samples were incubated at 55\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and held at 10\u2009\u00b0C. Neutralize Tagment Buffer (5\u2009\u03bcL) was added and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5\u2009min to stop the tagmentation reaction. Fragmented DNA was amplified with limited-cycle PCR using a Nextera XT Index Kit. Fifteen microliters of Nextera PCR Master Mix were added to the neutralized samples, and then 5\u2009\u03bcL of an index primer 1 and an index primer 2 was added and mixed thoroughly. The PCR was completed using the following cycling parameters: 72\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 12\u2009cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 55\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, then a final extension of 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, and a hold at 10\u2009\u00b0C (Illumina, Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Guide, Rev. E ed., Illumina 2015). \n\n\n### Library purification and sequencing \n  \nSmall fragments were removed from the PCR reaction by incubating the sample for 2\u2009min with 90\u2009\u03bcL of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at room temperature. The bead mixture was incubated for 2\u2009min on a magnetic stand to collect the beads. After supernatants were discarded, the beads were washed twice with 200\u2009\u03bcL of fresh 80% ethanol. The beads were dried for 15\u2009min at room temperature, resuspended in 52.5\u2009\u03bcL of Resuspension Buffer (RSB) and allowed to incubate for 2\u2009min to elute the DNA. Samples were placed on the magnetic stand until the supernatants were cleared. Cleared supernatants were transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and the libraries were quantitated using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen). Fragment sizes were determined by Agilent\u2019s 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 bp paired-end reads. \n\n\n### Sequence preparation \n  \nReads were filtered by quality score prior to alignment and reads with average Phred scores less than 20 were excluded from further analysis. Cutadapt [ ] was used to trim adapter sequences from reads. \n\n\n### Deletion detection \n  \nThe ROTLA package (for Reader of the Lost Arcs) uses a split-read approach for detecting deletions (reviewed in [ ]). To detect a deletion, it searches for reads whose ends map to two reference locations separated by more than one read length. The mtDNA reference was ChrM from Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (i.e., hg19, African (Yoruba) Sequence; GenBank AF347015.1). LostArc aligns sequencing reads using BLAT, an algorithm designed to quickly align expressed sequence tags [ ]. The small size of the mitochondrial genome allows a BLAT alignment to be performed efficiently, even when aligning many reads. BLAT was not designed for alignment to a circular sequence. To simulate a circular genome, reads were aligned to two copies of the mitochondrial genome arranged in tandem. When parsing alignments, ROTLA will adjust sequence indices consistent with circular alignment. To increase confidence in detected deletions, ROTLA will compare across reads in mate pairs and will only report deletions consistent across paired reads. To facilitate comparison, ROTLA will first left-align all detected breaks. Breaks are then evaluated considering each read alignment. If there is a conflict between two reads, meaning a break is reported in only one read though both reads span the junction of the break, then the break is not reported. ROTLA reports raw counts for each detected deletion. ROTLA makes no attempt to filter or curate the deletion list. We recommend comparison against control samples (such as the cultured HEK cells in the current work) for deletion validation. \n\nThe deletion load for each sample is calculable as the total number of reads across deletion junctions divided by the total read count (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1). \n\n\n### Calculating deletion frequencies from read counts \n  \nThe ROTLA count of reads supporting each deletion must be converted into deletion frequencies, accounting for differing molecular sizes and the mappability of each locus. This study focuses on mtDNA deletions that are not contained within repeat tracts, and most of our analyses are confined to deletions longer than 10 base pairs. We make a simplifying assumption that each starting DNA molecule has no more than one deletion larger than a few base pairs, and this assumption appears to hold true for most samples. However, the following calculations are approximations for samples with very high deletion frequencies, such as samples with obvious germline or early development deletions (M15, M35, and M36) or samples with very high cumulative deletion rates (e.g., M24). \n\nWe further assume that sequencing reads originate from each position within each DNA molecule in the starting sample with equal probability, after correcting for context effects. In other words, sequencing depth is proportional to population fraction. Let    f    represent the frequency of a particular mtDNA molecular species or set of species, expressed as a fraction of the total mtDNA population. The species may bear a particular deletion (  i  ), have no deletions (  i  \u2009=\u2009  u  ), or represent all species present in the sample (  i  \u2009=\u2009  t  ). If    d    is the average depth of reads due to species   i  , then.\n \n\nThe average depth may be expressed in a generalized form,\n \n\nand in a form that is specific to molecules containing deletions,\n \n\nHere   r   is the effective number of reads mapped to species   i  ,   L   is the length of species   i  ,   L   is the read length, here taken to be the average read length for the sample of interest,   x   is the number of reads spanning the breakpoint junction of deletion   i  , and   \u03b4   is the mappability factor for reads with breakpoint   i  . The mappability factor is calculated from the HEK control sample and is simply the median depth divided by the mean depth at the two positions that define the breakpoint junction for deletion   i  . \n\nFor molecules without deletions, the generalized form of the average depth is applicable from Eq.\u00a0 ,\n \n\nSetting Eqs.\u00a0  and\u00a0  equal to one another and rearranging yields\n \n\nThe total number of mapped reads must equal the sum of the reads mapped to all species, thus\n \n\nand therefore, after isolating the component due to species   u   and rearranging,\n \n\nTaking Eq.\u00a0  and isolating the denominator component due to species   u   yields\n \n\nFinally, sequential substitutions of Eqs.\u00a0 ,  , and then   into Eq.\u00a0  yield\n \n\nThis is the formula used to calculate deletion frequency in this study. However, an approximation may be useful when complete information on all species is lacking or when full computation is difficult. The last two denominator terms in Eq.\u00a0  are related by\n \n\nbecause deletant species are shorter than the full-length reference. Thus,\n \n\nis the upper bound approximation of the fraction of the population for any given deletant species. \n\nDeletion frequencies above 10  correlate well between subsamples of M22 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S2d and e; linear correlation between bins,   R  \u2009>\u20090.99). Above this boundary lie very rare deletions, for which individual rates are confidently determined. Below this boundary lie ultra-rare deletions, for which collective rates are accurate but individual rates are subject to stochastic variation. \n\n\n### Estimating the boundary frequencies for multi-fiber deletion species \n  \nGiven skeletal muscle density of about 1.06\u2009mg/\u03bcL [ ,  ] and muscle samples of 20\u201325\u2009mg, sample volumes should average 18.9\u201323.6\u2009\u03bcL. Initial muscle biopsies were approximately cylindrical, but sub-sampling resulted in less regular shapes. As a simplification, these volumes imply cubes of about 2.66\u20132.87\u2009mm in width with minimum cross-sectional areas of 7.09\u20138.22\u2009mm . Dividing by the mean quadriceps fiber cross-sectional area of 3630\u2009\u03bcm  [ ] indicates there are around 1950\u20132270 truncated muscle fibers per sample. Taking the reciprocal suggests any deletion that exceeds about 5.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910  of the population must come from multiple fibers. Knowing the total mass of DNA purified from each sample and the relative ratios of nuclear and mtDNA determined by qPCR (Fig.\u00a0 c and Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S1) indicates the average number of nuclei per initial Gwt muscle sample is around 380,100. This means there would be an average of 168\u2013195 nuclei per truncated fiber, or about 66 nuclei per mm of fiber, which is similar to the density of nuclei determined with microscopy measurements [ ] in which only 1\u20134% are likely myosatellite nuclei [ ,  ]. Similarly, about 1.08\u2009\u00d7\u200910  mtDNA circles are present in each initial Gwt muscle sample, suggesting that one unique deletion in one mtDNA circle would occur at a frequency of about 9.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910  in a given sample. Also, there would be about 479,000\u2013556,000 mtDNA per truncated fiber. Combining values yields about 2850 mtDNA per nucleus, which essentially matches past measurements of mtDNA copy number in skeletal muscle determined by shotgun sequencing (2788) or digital drop PCR (2744) [ ]. \n\n\n### Calculating ablation levels \n  \nThe ablation level at biopsy (   a   ) is defined as the amount of mtDNA lost from existing circles due to deletion. It is calculated from deletion frequencies (   f   ) and fractional deletion lengths (   L   \u2009   \u2212\u2009L   )/   L   :\n \n\nThis is usually expressed as a percentage and is equivalent to the area above curves such as those in Fig.\u00a0 b. \n\nThe ablation level at onset (   a   , Fig.\u00a0 e) is approximated by projecting a line from the ablation level at biopsy age (   y   ) toward the origin through the age of disease onset (   y   ):\n \n\nNote that this is a first approximation. Better approximations will require samples of each   POLG   genotype at many more ages, some of which will be very difficult to acquire due to patient youth and genotypic rarity. \n\n\n### Visualizing lost arcs \n  \nArc plots (examples in Fig.\u00a0 c, d; all samples in Additional file  : Arc Maps) were created in Circos [ ]. \n\n\n### Hierarchical clustering of deletion patterns \n  \nFor exploratory analysis, breakpoint rates for each sample were first binned by breakpoint position by dividing the mitochondrial genome into 80 equally sized bins. Breakpoints were then binned into a two-dimensional array (80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 bins) based on binned start and end positions. Due to higher sequencing error rates, the veracity of individual small deletions was suspect, so breakpoints were excluded if they were between two positions within 40\u2009bps on the genome. Pilot experiments with commercial DNA had age-independent breakpoint peaks in a T-shaped region of these plots (deletions from between positions 1 and 5700 to between 15,949 and 16,156; deletions from between 3107 and 3314 to between 12,000 and 16,156) that were not seen in Gwt muscle samples collected before 80\u2009years of age. Breakpoints within this region were excluded because we suspected such breaks were caused by commercial DNA extraction protocols. After binning, breakpoint counts were normalized by the total number of binned breakpoints for each sample. \n\n\n### Principal component analysis of deletion patterns \n  \nAfter samples were clustered into clades by similarity, a representative subset of samples was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to find the underlying patterns that explained the most variation between samples. Binned arrays for each sample were flattened into one-dimensional vectors, and these vectors were applied to principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering. Both were performed using the Python package scikit-learn [ ]. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the complete linkage method considering the Euclidean distance between vectors. Three-dimensional scatterplots of PCA components and dendrograms capturing cluster results were generated using the Python package plotly (Plotly Technologies Inc. Collaborative data science. Montr\u00e9al, QC, 2015;  ). \n\nInitial attempts to identify the principal components affecting variation of deletion patterns between samples included all samples and proved fraught with noise from excessive variance. When balancing breadth of discovery against the potential for overparameterization, we realized that the most explanatory PCA components are consumed describing the idiosyncrasies of unique Gvar samples with unique deletion features. Accordingly, we limited our analysis to the first three principal components and focused on a select subset of samples to identify shared underlying deletion patterns. We included all Gwt samples, the three samples comprising the best Gvar time series (homozygous   POLG   A467T), one Gvar from outside the major clades (M24   POLG   A467T;S933R), and one representative from each major Gvar clade (Fig.\u00a0 a). Samples M22 (  POLG   R1096C;W748S) from the AT-WS clade and M25 (  POLG   A467T;T251I/P587L) from the TI-PL clade were selected because their deletion patterns broadly represent their clades and because a small number of deletions (780 deletions with 623 junctions) previously reported for each sample [ ] presented an opportunity for discovery due to the sensitivity and depth of LostArc (3.3 million deletions with 87,071 junctions). \n\n\n### Monte Carlo simulations of replication/deletion processes \n  \nDeletions in Monte Carlo models are simulated by randomly selecting a deletion start point from a defined distribution and then randomly selecting an end site from another defined distribution. A large number of distribution combinations were tested in smaller pilot simulations, from which six, representing potential deletion mechanisms and recapitulating at least some of the features of the observations, were selected for full simulation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6). Simulations were regressed by minimizing the log domain least squares difference between simulated and observed deletion terminus density (e.g., Fig.\u00a0 f, h and Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Fig. S6). In order to avoid overfitting, no model was allowed more than five adjustable parameters. Thus, deletions modeled in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions were forced to share parameters rather than varying independently. All models included a linear scaling parameter and a selection coefficient. The latter is a value between zero and one. Simulated deletions that impinge upon an origin position are assigned a uniformly distributed random value in that range. If the random value exceeds the coefficient, the deletion is removed from the simulated population. A selection process like the one that this coefficient simulates is implied by the positional ablation levels in Fig.\u00a0 b. All six models here select against 7S-DNA 3\u2032-end (7S-3\u2032) deletant species and four also select against   oriL   deletants. Simulated deletions shorter than 1\u2009bp (possible in models 2\u20136), or that exceed the mtDNA reference size (16,571\u2009bp; models 2\u20136), or that impinge upon the origin from whence they originated (models 3\u20136), are also removed from the population. It is possible that the latter should be selected against rather than removed, but the requisite selection coefficient would cause most models to exceed the limit of five tunable parameters. In addition to the scaling and selection parameters, a normal distribution adds mean and standard deviation parameters and an exponential distribution adds a negative shape parameter. Two hundred and forty thousand deletions were simulated in each direction for each model, meaning 240,000 total simulations each for models 3 and 4 and 480,000 simulations for each other model. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7500033, "text_md5": "075f77796c2cf9598a69512fa8e3bec7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 295], "journal": [296, 307], "publication_year": [309, 313], "title": [324, 413], "keywords": [427, 427], "abstract": [440, 1656], "body": [1665, 91464]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32943091, "doi": "10.1186/s13059-020-02138-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500033", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7500033"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500033\">7500033</a>", "list_title": "PMC7500033  Ultrasensitive deletion detection links mitochondrial DNA replication, disease, and aging"}

We also describe RNA extraction and cDNA preparation from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Before you begin \n  \nThe main purpose of this protocol is to permit the isolation of RNA from a low number of cells to perform RNA-seq. Before starting the protocol, it is advisable to wipe all working surfaces and instruments with RNAseZAP RNase Decontamination Solution.  \n CRITICAL:   Unless otherwise specified, all reagents and materials used in the RNA extraction section and below are certified as DNase- and RNase-free. Collect cells in Trizol. \n  \n  Note:    All reagents should be equilibrated to \u223c25\u00b0C before starting RNA extraction. \n \n\n\n## Key resources table \n  \n  \n\n\n## Materials and equipment \n  \n \n  Alternatives:    This protocol requires the use of a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to accurately measure the concentration of total RNA recovered from RNA extraction. If a Qubit Fluorometer is not available, a PicoGreen staining may be employed to evaluate RNA concentration using a plate reader. Alternatively, this step can be omitted and the RNA analyzed with a Fragment Analyzer Systems (Agilent) to assess both quality and quantity. We strongly suggest analyzing the RNA quality with a Fragment Analyzer Systems before proceeding further. \n  \n Pause point:   Extracted and purified RNA samples can be stored at \u221280\u00b0C for a maximum of two weeks but we recommend continuing the protocol up to the conversion of RNA into cDNA. Earlier stopping points can negatively affect the final library complexity. \n \n\n\n## Step-by-step method details \n  \n### Muscle dissection, antibody staining, and flow activated cell sorting (FACS) \n  \n \n Timing: \u223c6 h  \n   \n200 MuSCs cells are isolated from skeletal muscle tissue following tissue digestion and FACS protocols.   \nThe starting material consists of at least one muscle, such as the tibialis anterior (TA), from one mouse, and can be scaled up to additional muscles and biological replicates. Digestion of one TA muscle is sufficient to obtain 200 MuSCs after the completion of this protocol; however, other hindlimb and forelimb muscles can be included, such as gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and triceps, to isolate higher numbers of MuSCs. \n  \nIn order to obtain an unicellular suspension of skeletal muscle ready for FACS, the muscle tissue is isolated from previously euthanized mice and digested following the protocol described below. The following steps should be performed in a tissue culture hood to avoid contamination. \n  \nDissect muscle tissue with small scissors and collect it in cold Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) into 50\u00a0mL Falcon tubes. Decant muscle into a petri dish and remove DMEM 1% P/S completely. Mince the muscle using small scissors and razor blades until small pieces are achieved and place them into new 50\u00a0mL Falcon tubes with the digestion mix, composed by Ham\u2019s F10 medium containing 5\u00a0mg/mL of liberase (Roche, #177246), 0.4\u00a0mM CaCl , 5\u00a0mM MgCl  and 0.3% dispase (Gibco, #17105-041). We recommend using 5\u00a0mL of digestion buffer per 1\u00a0g of initial muscle tissue material, which can be increased up to 10\u00a0mL for larger samples (1\u20132 g) or more fibrotic samples (for example, muscle tissue from very old mice). \n  \nIncubate the samples in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1\u20132 h. Centrifuge the cells at 50   g   for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, collect the supernatant and discard the pellet.  \n  Optional:    wash the pellet and collect the supernatant again to improve cells\u2019 recovery. \n \n  \nConsecutively filter the supernatant through 100\u00a0\u03bcm and 70\u00a0\u03bcm strainer filters into new 50\u00a0mL Falcon tubes. Following a centrifuging step at 670   g   for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, remove the supernatant, gently resuspend the cells in 2\u00a0mL of lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, #555899) to lyse red blood cells following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and incubate for 10\u00a0min on ice. Next, add 40\u00a0mL of cold FACS buffer, composed by PBS supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), filter the sample through a 40\u00a0\u03bcm strainer filter into new 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube and count the cells. Centrifuge at 670   g   for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells at 1  \u00d7  10  cells/mL concentration in the FACS buffer. \n  \nConsecutively filter the supernatant through 100\u00a0\u03bcm and 70\u00a0\u03bcm strainer filters into new 50\u00a0mL Falcon tubes. Following a centrifuging step at 670   g   for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, remove the supernatant, gently resuspend the cells in 2\u00a0mL of lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, #555899) to lyse red blood cells following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and incubate for 10\u00a0min on ice. Next, add 40\u00a0mL of cold FACS buffer, composed by PBS supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), filter the sample through a 40\u00a0\u03bcm strainer filter into new 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube and count the cells. Centrifuge at 670   g   for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells at 1  \u00d7  10  cells/mL concentration in the FACS buffer. \n  \nStain the sample with PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-Sca-1, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD31, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD34 and PE-conjugated anti-ITGA7 antibodies for 30\u00a0min on ice, protected from light (see Key Resources Table for details). Finally, wash the cells with 40\u00a0mL of cold PBS, centrifuge at 670   g   for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, remove the supernatant and resuspend the sample in 0.5\u00a0mL of cold PBS (add more PBS if digestion yields are >1M of cells). Filter through a test tube with cell strainer cap to eliminate cell aggregates and stain with DAPI (final concentration 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) 5\u00a0min prior to FACS ( ) ( ). \n  \nBased on the relative expression of different markers (in this case CD34 and ITGA7), collect 200 cells of distinct MuSCs populations from the same sample ( ). For this purpose, we employ a FACS Aria II sorter (BD) with 4-way purity precision mode that allows simultaneous separation of a maximum of 4 populations. Employ cell granularity (side scatter, SSC-A), cell size (forward scatter, FSC-A) and DAPI staining to exclude cell aggregates, debris, and dead cells. PE-Cy7  events (corresponding to CD45 , Sca-1  and CD31  cells) are used for lineage-negative selection and Alexa Fluor 647  and PE  (which identify CD34  and ITGA7  populations respectively) for double positive staining of MuSCs ( ). Sort MuSCs directly into PCR tubes pre-filled with 10\u00a0\u03bcl of Reaction buffer to avoid unnecessary transferring steps and loss of material.   \nGating strategy employed to isolated MuSCs by FACS \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Reverse transcription of RNA derived from FACS-sorted MuSCs \n  \n \n Timing: \u223c3 h  \n   \nWe employ the Takara \u201cSMART-Seq v4\u00a0Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing\u201d (Cat. Nos. 634888, 634889, 634890, 634891, 634892, 634893, and 634894) to generate full-length cDNAs directly from 200 FACS-isolated MuSCs. The protocol allows direct cell lysis and retrotranscription without prior RNA extraction. \n   \n  Note:    The following steps are conducted as described in the TAKARA protocol accompanying the kits with minor changes listed below ( ). This is the link to the detailed protocol: \n \n\n  \nPrepare a stock solution of 10  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer by mixing 19\u00a0\u03bcL of the 10  \u00d7   Lysis Buffer with 1\u00a0\u03bcL of the RNase inhibitor.   \nSchematic representation of MuSC FACS isolation, direct cell lysis, and cDNA synthesis \n  \n  \nPrepare a solution of 1  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer by mixing nuclease-free water and the 10  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer. Place 10\u00a0\u03bcL of the 1  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer directly into an individual 0.2\u00a0mL RNase-free PCR tube. \n   \n  Note:    We estimated that the amount of FACS flow buffer coming from droplets with 200 MuSCs leads to approximately 0.4\u20130.5\u00a0\u03bcl with 4-way purity precision mode and 85\u00a0\u03bcm nozzle size, and therefore, adjusted the 1  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer volume accordingly. We recommend running prior tests to determine volume increase resulting from FACS flow buffer to avoid Reaction Buffer dilution. This volume depends on the sorting machine and parameters employed, such as nozzle size and precision mode. \n   \nResuspend stained cells in PBS and directly sort 200 MuSCs into an RNase-free PCR tube with 9\u00a0\u03bcL of 1  \u00d7   Reaction Buffer. \n   \n  Note:    Avoid using FBS or other serum, which are usually placed into FACS buffer, during sorting since it may interfere with the following RNA transcription steps. \n   \nIncubate the cell:reaction buffer mix at \u223c25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. \n  \nPlace the samples on ice and add 2\u00a0\u03bcl of 3\u2032 SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A. Mix by gentle vortexing and then spin the tube(s) briefly to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube. \n   \n  Note:    Bring the final volume to 12.5\u00a0\u03bcl by adding additional Nuclease-Free Water if necessary \n   \nIncubate the tubes at 72\u00b0C in a preheated, hot-lid thermal cycler for 3\u00a0min. Immediately place the samples on ice for 2\u00a0min. \n   \n  Note:    Prepare the First Strand Master Mix \n \n\n(See Buffer preparation instructions in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol while the samples are incubating.   )    \nPreheat the thermal cycler to 42\u00b0C. \n  \nAdd 2\u00a0\u03bcL per reaction, plus 10%, of the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase to the Master Mix. \n   \n  Note:    Add the reverse transcriptase to the Master Mix just before use, making sure to gently mix the reverse transcriptase tube without vortexing before adding it. \n  \n  Note:    Mix the Master Mix well by gently vortexing and then spin the tube(s) briefly in a minicentrifuge to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube. \n   \nAdd 7.5\u00a0\u03bcl of the Master Mix to each reaction tube. Mix the contents of the tubes by gently pipetting and spin them briefly to collect the contents at the bottom of the tubes. \n  \nPlace the tubes in a thermal cycler with a heated lid, preheated to 42\u00b0C, and run the following program: \n     \n Pause point:   The tubes can be stored at 4\u00b0C for 12\u201318 h. \n   \nThaw all the reagents needed for PCR (except the enzyme) on ice. Gently vortex each reagent tube to mix and spin down briefly. Store on ice. \n  \nPrepare PCR Master Mix combining the following reagents in the order shown: \n  \nAdd 30\u00a0\u03bcl of PCR Master Mix to each tube containing 20\u00a0\u03bcL of first-strand cDNA product from step 11. \n  \nPlace the samples in a preheated thermal cycler with a heated lid and run the following program. Refer to manufacture instructions to determine the optimal number of cycles (N).  \n     \n Pause point:   The tubes may be stored at 4\u00b0C for 12\u201318 h. \n   \nPurify the amplified cDNA using the Agencourt AMPure XP Kit (Beckman Coulter, Cat# A63881) according to Takara instructions   .  \n   \n  Note:    The appropriate volume ratio of beads/samples is reported in the Takara instructions   .  \n \n\n\n### RNA extraction by TRIzol \n  \n \n Timing: \u223c2\u00a0days  \n \n\nAs an alternative to the Takara SmarterSeq v4 kit, when direct lysis of cells is not possible, we suggest extracting RNA by collecting cells directly in a 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube with 250  l of Trizol. The following protocol has been optimized using mouse embryonic stem (E14 ESCs) ( ). \n\nThe following protocol allows recovering of sufficient RNA to generate a library from 5,000 to 10,000 cells ( A).  \n  Note:    All the reagents used are certified as DNase and RNase free. \n  \n CRITICAL:   Trizol is a phenol-based reagent and must always be used in a biochemical hood. Eyes and skin exposure should be avoided. Follow the safety data sheet when handling Trizol. \n  \n Pause point:   Cells can be stored in Trizol at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term storage. \n   \nThaw Trizol samples at \u223c25\u00b0C, if frozen. \n  \nLet samples stand at \u223c25\u00b0C for 5\u201310\u00a0min. \n  \nDuring this time, pre-spin the 5PRIME Phase Lock Heavy Gel tubes (QuantaBio, Cat # 2302830) at 1,600\u00a0g for 45 sec to collect gel on tube bottoms. \n   \n  Note:    5PRIME Phase Lock Heavy Gel tubes facilitate the recovery of the aqueous phase and minimize potential carry-over from the the phenol-chloroform phase. Alternatively, the two phases can be separated following the Trizol manifactures\u2019s protocol. \n   \nAdd cells already lysed in Trizol to the 5PRIME Phase Lock Heavy Gel tubes and incubate for 5\u00a0min at \u223c25\u00b0C. \n  \nExamine phasing. \n   \n  Note:    Clear, aqueous phase should be entirely at the top of the 5PRIME Phase Lock Heavy Gel. The phenol-chloroform phase and cloudy interphase should be below 5PRIME Phase Lock Gel's layer. \n   \nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcl Chloroform \n  \nManually invert the tubes 5 times. \n   \n  Note:    Do not vortex. \n   \nIncubate at \u223c25\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. \n  \nCentrifuge at 12,000   g   at 4\u00b0C, for 15\u00a0min. \n   \n  Note:    Examine the Eppendorf tube. A transparent, aqueous phase should be located at the top of the 5PRIME Phase Lock Heavy Gel. The phenol-chloroform phase and a cloudy interphase should both be below the Phase Lock Gel layer. \n   \nCentrifuge at 12,000   g   at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. \n  \nRecover and transfer the rest of the aqueous phase with a 20\u00a0\u03bcl pipette. \n   \n CRITICAL:   Samples with a high content of fat, protein, polysaccharides, or extracellular material may require additional clean-up steps. ( ). \n   \nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcg of molecular grade Glycogen (or GlycoBlue). \n  \nAdd 250\u00a0\u03bcl of molecular grade isopropanol. \n  \nInvert tube 10 times to mix (or vortex on a 'low' setting for 15 sec) \n  \nLet samples precipitate at \u221220\u00b0C for 12\u201318 h. \n   \n  Note:    Precipitation can be shortened to 60\u201390\u00a0min, however, for maximum recovery yield we recommend performing this step for 12\u201318 h. \n   \nCentrifuge at 12,000   g  , 4\u00b0C, for 30\u201345\u00a0min \n  \nGently discard the supernatant leaving approximately 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcl behind. \n   \n  Note:    The RNA pellet may detach from the tube and float. \n  \n  Note:    When starting with less than 100,000 cells a pellet cannot be visualized by eye. We suggest removing the tubes from the centrifuge very slowly and identifying the side of the tube where the pellet is located after centrifugation ( B). \n   \nAdd 500\u00a0\u03bcl of freshly prepared 75% EtOH, mix 10 times by inversion. \n  \nCentrifuge at 7,500   g  , 4\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. \n  \nGently discard the supernatant leaving approximately 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcl behind without disturbing the pellet. \n   \n  Note 1:    The RNA pellet may detach from the tube and float. \n  \n  Note 2:    When starting with less than 100,000 cells a pellet cannot be seen by eye. We suggest removing the tubes from the centrifuge very slowly and identifying the side of the tube where the pellet is located after centrifugation. \n   \nSlowly remove most of the residual EtOH with a p10 pipette leaving 2\u20135\u00a0\u03bcl of EtOH ( C). \n  \nAir dry the RNA pellet for about 15\u201320\u00a0min. \n  \nRe-suspend the RNA pellet in 15\u00a0\u03bcL of RNAse/DNAse free water. Keep the resuspended RNA on ice and immediately proceed to the next step. \n   \n CRITICAL:   Remove as much ethanol as possible using a 10\u00a0\u03bcL pipette before air-drying the pellet for approximately 5\u00a0min. Do not over-dry the pellet. Over-drying will decrease RNA solubility. Air-dry the pellet in a clean, RNase-free location. \n   \nProceed with DNase treatment using a commercially available kit. We used the Turbo-DNA free kit from Invitrogen, following manufacturer instructions with no modifications ( ). \n  \nPerform polyadenylation enrichment, cDNA conversion, and fragmentation RNA quality assessment and quantification. \n    \nRNA isolation and retrieval \n\n(A) Schematic representation of RNA isolation by Trizol. \n\n(B) Identification of RNA pellet following isopropanol precipitation and centrifugation. \n\n(C) Residual ethanol to be left following RNA precipitation. \n  \n\n\n### RNA quantification and quality control \n  \n \n Timing: \u223c30\u00a0min  \n   \nQuantify the amount of total RNA recovered using a Qubit instrument (See Materials and Equipment section for alternatives) \n   \n  Note:    RNA at this stage can also be quantified by Nanodrop but the limited sensitivity of this instrument leads to imprecise quantification for low amounts of RNA. \n \n\nAnalyze the quality of the RNA using a Fragment Analyzer.  \n  Note:    Degraded RNA (RNA integrity number, RIN <7) will decrease the efficiency of cDNA conversion and library preparation. \n \n\n\n### cDNA conversion \n  \n \n Timing: \u223c2 h  \n \n\nFollowing RNA quantification, 10\u2013250   g   of RNA is enriched for mRNAs by polyadenylation selection, converted to cDNA, and fragmented. \n\nThe steps are performed using NEB buffers and enzymes. Currently, all the required reagents are part of the \u201cNEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module\u201d (E7490) and \u201cNEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u201d (E7770, E7775).  \n  Note:    The following steps are conducted exactly as described in the NEB protocol accompanying the kits. This is the link to the extended protocol: \n \n\nhttps://international.neb.com/protocols/2017/03/04/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-poly-a-mrna-magnetic-isolation-module-e7490-and-nebnext-ultra-ii-rn \n\nThe same steps described in the protocol are reported here:   \nPrepare First-Strand Reaction Buffer and Random Primer Mix according to manufacture instructions in a nuclease-free microcentrifuge tube. ( ). \n   \n  Note:    Keep the mix on ice until mRNA is purified. \n   \nDilute the total RNA with nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50\u00a0\u03bcl in a nuclease-free 0.2\u00a0mL PCR tube. \n  \nPrepare and wash oligo-dT beads according to manufacturer instructions (  )  \n  \nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcl beads to each RNA sample. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down six times. \n  \nIncubate at \u223c25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. \n  \nMove the samples onto a magnetic rack to separate the beads and discard the supernatant. \n  \nWash the beads twice according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (  )  . \n  \nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcl of Tris buffer (provided in NEB #E7490 kit) to each tube. Gently pipette up and down 6 times. \n  \nPlace the tube on the thermocycler with the heated lid set at \u2265 90\u00b0C and run the following program: \n     \n  Note:    Remove the tube from the thermocycler only when the temperature reaches 25\u00b0C. \n   \nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcl of RNA Binding Buffer (2  \u00d7  ) to the samples.

Following ENCODE\u2019s recommendations, samples are sequenced at a depth of \u223c40\u00a0M reads/sample. Libraries are also compatible with sequencing on other Illumina instruments with minor adjustments during library preparation as described in the manufactured protocols ( ). \n  \n\n\n\n## Expected outcomes \n  \n### SMART-seq v4\u00a0Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing \n  \n1\u00a0\u03bcl of the final cDNA should be validated using a Fragment Analyzer. See the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit User Manual for instructions ( ). \n\nSuccessful cDNA synthesis and amplification should show a distinct peak spanning 400\u00a0bp to 10,000\u00a0bp, peaked at \u223c2,500\u00a0bp. \n\nThe expected yield is 3.4\u201317\u00a0ng of cDNA (depending on the cell type and initial cell number). \n\n\n### RNA extraction by Trizol \n  \nThe quality of the extracted RNA should be assessed by Fragment Analyzer. Ideally, the analysis should show a very small amount of RNA degradation, an RNA integrity number, RIN  7, and the absence of genomic DNA contamination. \n\nThe amount of total RNA recovered correlates with the number of cells processed and varies for different cell types. \n\n\n### Library preparation \n  \nLibraries should have a total yield of 10\u2013100\u00a0ng of cDNA with a size distribution centered on \u223c300\u00a0bp. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \n### FACS \n  \nFACS analysis does not allow to separate more than 4 populations from one sample at the same time. Additionally, prolonged sorting duration resulting from the low frequency of the cell population of interest leads to high mortality of sorted cells and negatively impacts RNA quality. Efforts should be made to reduce the sorting time. \n\n\n### cDNA Libraries \n  \nThe quality of the initial RNA is the prime determinant for generation of an optimal cDNA library. Moreover, first-strand cDNA synthesis using Takara Smarter Seq v4 requires isolation of RNA or cells in a maximum volume of 9.5  l. Therefore, special care should be taken to limit volume variations and plastic retention of both RNA and cDNA. \n\n\n### Cell fixation and cultured cells \n  \nThe protocol has not been tested for MuSCs that have been fixed in paraformaldehyde   in vitro   or   in vivo   prior to isolation. Finally, the procedures described here to generate libraries for both FACS-isolated MuSCs and mESCs have not been tested on cultured primary cells or cell lines. However, we anticipate that they will be adaptable for cultured cells. \n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting \n  \n### Problem 1 \n  \nPoor quality or insufficient cDNA yield (step 71). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nThe quality and quantity of the starting material is crucial when working with rare cell populations or low starting material. Exclude adipose tissue (white fat), nerves and tendons during dissection since they may impair the digestion efficiency, obstruct cell strainers during sample filtration steps and introduce cross-contamination with cell types from other close-by tissues. \n\n\n### Problem 2 \n  \nLow MuSCs Yield (step 1d). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nDigestion time can be prolonged to obtain higher cell yields, especially in the case of muscle tissue obtained from very old animals. However, sustained digestion can also lead to higher cell mortality rates, therefore, we do not recommend exceeding 2\u00a0h of digestion. \n\nIt is important to dispose of dead cells and debris as much as possible. During sample preparation, some cells lyse and release DNA, which leads to aggregate formation and hampers the sorting. Treatment with DNase prior to cell sorting helps to overcome this problem. \n\n\n### Problem 3 \n  \nLow purity of FACS-sorted MuSCs (step 1f). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nWhen working with very low number of cells, high purity of the sorted population should be achieved. To do so, use all necessary controls for FACS panel elaboration prior to sample sorting, including:   \nNegative (unstained) controls: needed for lasers\u2019 intensity set up and determining the sample autofluorescence. \n  \nSingle stained controls: individual staining with each antibody or dye, needed for compensation of false signal resulting from spectral overlap between two fluorochromes. \n  \nFluorescence minus one (FMO) controls: staining with all antibodies with an exception of one, which are needed to properly discriminate among the cell populations. \n  \n\nEnrichment of the sample with the population of interest by magnetic bead-based negative selection should be considered to reduce sorting duration. \n\n\n### Problem 4 \n  \nRNA degradation (step 42). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nWhile handling a low amount of RNA, it is important to maintain an RNase-free environment to avoid RNA degradation. We recommend working in a designated area with designated pipettes cleaned with RNAse ZAP decontaminant solution. \n\n\n### Problem 5 \n  \nInsufficient RNA or cDNA (steps 42 and 71). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nTo minimize the loss of material, we suggest using low-binding PCR tubes and low retention tips for sorting, RNA extraction, cDNA retro-transcription, and library preparation. \n\n\n### Problem 6 \n  \nInsufficient cDNA (steps 17 and 71). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nUnder- or over-drying the pellet during cDNA purification with AMPure XP magnetic beads may affect cDNA recovery and final yield. Under-dried pellet appears translucid, the residual ethanol may interfere with the final yield. Over-dried pellet will present cracks. It will take longer than 2\u00a0min to rehydrate, and final yield will again be affected. \n\nIt is advisable to carefully look at the pellet and adjust the drying time according with the appearance of the pellet. \n\n\n### Problem 7 \n  \nInsufficient cDNA (step 16). \n\n\n### Potential solution \n  \nWhen possible, the optimal number of PCR cycles required for each experiment should be empirically determined in a parallel preparation. We recommend using the lowest PCR cycle number that generates enough material for library preparation. \n\n\n\n## Resource availability \n  \n### Lead contact \n  \nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Vittorio Sartorelli  \n\n\n### Materials availability \n  \nThis study did not generate new unique reagents. \n\n\n### Data and code availability \n  \nThis study did not generate any novel data or codes that are not presented in this published article directly. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8079445, "text_md5": "1f079b70b0ef25940f9c4c3e454c8993", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 133], "journal": [134, 145], "publication_year": [147, 151], "title": [162, 301], "keywords": [315, 418], "abstract": [431, 1750], "body": [1759, 29179]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33937872, "doi": "10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100451", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079445", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8079445"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079445\">8079445</a>", "list_title": "PMC8079445  Protocol for RNA-seq library preparation starting from a rare muscle stem cell population or a limited number of mouse embryonic stem cells"}

While the relationship between alcohol consumption and lipid and liver function enzyme (LFT) biomarkers has been previously examined, the associations of HIBD with those biomarkers remain unknown. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nTo examine associations of HIBD with lipid and LFT levels in a cross-sectional sample enriched with participants who engage in HIBD. \n\n\n## Design, Setting, and Participants \n  \nCross-sectional study using data from the NIAAA clinical sample collected from March 3, 2005, to August 21, 2017, with participants recruited for either the NIAAA screening protocols or inpatient alcohol treatment program. For this study, participants were stratified by self-reported alcohol consumption into 4 sex-specific binge levels: nonbinge and 1, 2, and 3 or more times the binge threshold (levels I, II, and III). Multivariable analyses examined the odds of clinically high levels of lipids and LFTs across binge levels. Analyses were performed from December 3, 2018, to January 30, 2019. \n\n\n## Main Outcomes and Measures \n  \nSerum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 2065 participants underwent protocol screening; 1519 with data available on alcohol consumption, body mass index, lipid levels, and LFT levels were included in the final analyses. Mean (SD) age was 39.7 (12.1) years; mean (SD) body mass index was 26.6 (5.1); 978 (64.4%) were male; 718 (47.3%) were white; and 578 (31.1%) consumed alcohol at the nonbinge level, 321 (21.2%) at level I, 239 (15.7%) at level II, and 318 (25.1%) at level III. High-intensity binge drinking was associated with 2- to 8-fold increased odds for clinically high levels of HDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and all LFTs (eg, for HDL-C: level III odds ratio [OR], 8.65; 95% CI, 4.75-15.77 and for \u03b3-glutamyltransferase: level III OR, 8.21; 95% CI, 5.90-11.43). Increased HIBD frequency (days consuming at levels II and III) was associated with increased odds for clinically high levels of HDL-C, total cholesterol, and all LFTs (per unit increase in days consuming at the respective binge level) (eg, for HDL-C: level II OR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.014-1.036 and level III OR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.019-1.047 and for \u03b3-glutamyltransferase: level II OR, 1.028; 95% CI, 1.019-1.037 and level III OR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.019-1.047). \n\n\n## Conclusions and Relevance \n  \nHigh-impact binge drinking was significantly associated with increased odds for clinically high levels of lipids and LFTs. Given that HIBD is increasingly common among US adults, targeted interventions aimed at reducing HIBD may have important health benefits. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe percentage of US adults reporting binge drinking, defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in a given day,  has escalated in the last 2 decades, with recent studies  finding that approximately 32 million adults engage in high-intensity binge drinking (HIBD), defined as consuming 2 or more times the NIAAA binge drinking cutoff.  This trend suggests that negative health outcomes associated with HIBD represent an emerging public health threat and that research examining the health effects of HIBD is needed.  The impact of alcohol on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and liver disease risk is partly predicted by changes in lipid profiles and liver function enzyme levels (LFTs),  but previous studies either grouped individuals reporting HIBD using dichotomous binge thresholds or excluded them as outliers. \n\nWhile the traditional binge thresholds have long been considered markers of development of risky alcohol use,  these dichotomous variables neither distinguish between behavior of alcohol consumption just above the threshold and behavior far exceeding the threshold  nor differentiate risk for anyone drinking above the threshold.  Recent studies  have shown that dose-dependent associations exist between health risk outcomes, such as illegal drug and tobacco use, risky sexual behavior, and injuries. However, the associations between HIBD and levels of both lipids and LFTs remain unknown. \n\nPrompted by the revised 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommendations  and the increase in HIBD, we performed an ad hoc analysis of the NIAAA intramural clinical sample, which is enriched with individuals who engage in HIBD and contains more granular alcohol consumption data than generally available from population-based studies, to examine the associations between HIBD and levels of lipids and LFTs. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study Population \n  \nThis study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( ) reporting guideline for cohort studies. The study was an ad hoc analysis of the NIAAA clinical cohort collected from March 3, 2005, through August 21, 2017. Participant data from this study came from 3 NIAAA protocols. Healthy volunteers and alcohol-dependent participants (diagnosed using the   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition  ) 18 years or older were recruited through local advertisements, word of mouth, or the NIAAA alcohol treatment program in Bethesda, Maryland. Women were excluded if they were breastfeeding, were pregnant, or intended to become pregnant. Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki  and the institutional review board of the NIAAA, which approved the study. Treatment-seeking participants were voluntarily admitted to the NIAAA inpatient unit in the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Following admission, treatment-seeking participants were detoxified from alcohol consumption and participated in the 28-day NIAAA alcohol treatment program, during which extensive clinical and physical examinations were performed. Healthy volunteers completed daylong screening assessments during which clinical characteristics and information regarding recent drinking history were collected. \n\n\n### Alcohol Consumption Patterns \n  \nA standard drink was defined as any drink containing 14 g pure alcohol.  The Timeline Followback (TLFB) questionnaire and interview uses a calendar and memory aids to improve recall of recent alcohol consumption behavior.  We used the TLFB information related to alcohol consumption for the 90 days prior to screening or admission. Following the definitions by Hingson et al  categorizing level I, II, and III as 1, 2, and 3 or more times drinking beyond the NIAAA binge threshold and the categorization by Patrick  of levels II and III as high-intensity drinking (HIBD), we constructed a similar typology. However, instead of creating binge levels based on the reported maximum single-day alcohol consumption from the past 12 months, we took advantage of the TLFB\u2019s day-level data and constructed our binge levels by dividing the total number of standard drinks consumed in the 90 days covered by the TLFB by the number of days with reported drinking, thus creating a drinks per drinking day (DPDD) variable. Our nonbinge group comprised men who reported consuming fewer than 5 DPDD on average over the 90 days prior to screening or admission and women who reported consuming fewer than 4 DPDD. Binge level I included men consuming between 5 and 9 DPDD and women consuming between 4 and 7 DPDD; level II included men consuming between 10 and 15 DPDD, and women consuming between 8 and 11 DPDD; and level III included men consuming more than 15 DPDD and women consuming 12 or more DPDD. \n\nUsing the reported day-level total alcohol consumption, we also constructed level I, II, and III binge frequencies, which we defined as the count of the number of days over the 90-day TFLB participants consumed at binge levels I, II, and III, as defined. \n\n\n### Blood Collection \n  \nBlood and plasma samples were collected after 10 hours of fasting the morning after inpatient admission day, or during a screening visit, using standard methods. All blood samples were drawn at approximately 8   after overnight bed rest and processed by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed between December 3, 2018, and January 30, 2019, using R statistical software version 3.3.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We calculated descriptive statistics for the final analytical sample by binge levels using the compareGroups package in R. We note an additional 9 missing observations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 1 for total cholesterol (TC), and 2 for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were removed from the analyses. We used analysis of variance, Kruskall-Wallis, and \u03c7  or Fisher exact tests, depending on whether the variable was normal, continuous nonnormal, or categorical (distributions determined by compareGroups), respectively, to determine whether the distribution of the variables differed across and between binge levels. \n\nTo investigate the association between clinically high levels of lipids or LFT and HIBD, we defined clinically high levels of lipids based upon the values used in the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults.  We defined clinically high levels of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) based on the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia  and levels of AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) based on the American College of Gastroenterology recommended guidelines.  Using the definition, each biomarker was classified as a dichotomous outcome; we report the statistics across binge levels. We then used multivariable logistic regression models to isolate the associations between binge levels and clinically high levels of lipids and LFTs, adjusting for age, race, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). We report the estimates as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals comparing the odds of presenting with a clinically high biomarker in the binge level compared with the odds in the non\u2013binge level reference group. \n\nWe also used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between and the frequency of consuming at each binge level (compared with the nonbinge reference) and clinically high levels of lipids and LFT biomarkers. The frequency was derived by counting the number of days (over the 90 days covered by the TLFB) participants reported consuming at each level; because the total number of days adds up to 90, we omitted the non\u2013binge level count to avoid multicollinearity. Total number of drinks consumed (over the 90-day TLFB), age, sex, race, and BMI were included as covariates. Regression estimates are reported as ORs with 95% confidence intervals for the clinically high lipid or LFT level per additional day of consuming at the specified binge level. Goodness of fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. \n\nWe hypothesized that levels of any of the 7 lipid or LFT biomarkers were differentially associated with levels of alcohol binge drinking (4 levels yielding 6 comparisons). Thus, we used a Bonferroni corrected threshold of   P  \u2009=\u2009.001 (nominal   P  \u2009=\u2009.05; 42 tests) to identify statistical significance for all analyses. All tests were 2-sided. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 2065 participants underwent protocol screening, and 1519 with available alcohol consumption, BMI, and lipid and LFT profiles were included in the final analyses. Descriptive statistics for the analytical cohort are presented ( ; eTable 1 in the  ). Mean (SD) age was 39.7 (12.1) years; mean (SD) BMI was 26.6 (5.1); 978 (64.4%) were male; 718 (47.3%) were white and 649 (42.7%) black/African American; and 578 (31.1%) consumed alcohol at the nonbinge level, 321 (21.2%) at level I, 239 (15.7%) at level II, and 381 (25.1%) at level III. In all, 99.5% of participants consuming at level III, 97% of participants at level II, 84.8% at level I, and 15.5% at the nonbinge level were diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Participants consuming at levels I, II, and III were older than those consuming at the nonbinge level. When lipid levels were tested, 9.8% of the participants presented with clinically high TC; 9.0%, HDL-C; 5.6%, LDL-C; and 8.8%, triglycerides (TRG). For LFTs, 35.9% had high levels of ALT; 28.9%, AST; and 56.4%, GGT (eTable 1 in the  ). Clinically high HDL-C significantly differed between nonbinge vs HIBD (levels II and III), and clinically high TRG and all LFTs significantly differed between nonbinge vs levels I and HIBD (levels II and III) consumption. \n   Descriptive Statistics by Alcohol Binge Level      \nMean levels (with unadjusted 95% CIs) of lipids and LFTs are shown in  . Levels of TC, HDL-C, and TRG showed dose-dependent increases across binge levels ( A). Mean levels of TRG were highest for level III consumption (194.0 mg/dL; 95% CI, 189.4-198.6 mg/dL [to convert cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]), with significant differences between nonbinge vs levels I, II, and III (  P  \u2009<\u2009.001). Mean levels of HDL-C were highest for level III consumption (72.1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 69.1-75.1 mg/dL), with significant differences between nonbinge vs HIBD level III and level I vs III consumption (  P  \u2009<\u2009.001). Mean levels of TRG were highest for level III (118.0 mg/dL; 95% CI, 109.0-127.0 mg/dL), with significant differences between nonbinge and levels I, II, and III consumption (  P  \u2009<\u2009.001). For LFTs ALT, AST, and GGT, mean levels showed similar dose-dependent increases across binge levels ( B), with mean levels of ALT (60.2 IU/L; 95% CI, 54.2-66.2 IU/L), AST (65.8 IU/L; 95% CI, 58.3-73.3 IU/L), and GGT (178.0 IU/L; 95% CI, 147.3-208.7 IU/L) highest for level III consumption. There were significant differences between nonbinge vs levels I, II, and III and between level I vs levels II and III consumption. \n   Means Levels of Lipid and Liver Function Test (LFT) Biomarkers by Alcohol Binge Levels  \nError bars indicate unadjusted 95% confidence intervals; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; GGT, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; and LDL, low-density lipoprotein. \n  \n\n### Multivariable Analysis Examining the Association Between Binge Levels and Clinically High Levels of Lipids and LFTs \n  \nWe found that alcohol consumption above the nonbinge level, especially at HIBD levels, was associated with increased odds of clinically high levels of HDL-C, TC, TRG, and LFTs ( ; eTable 2 in the  ). Compared with reference nonbinge consumption, level I consumption was associated with more than triple the odds of clinically high HDL-C (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.73-6.53;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001); level II consumption, more than 4 times the odds (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.27-8.89;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001); and level III consumption, more than 8 times the odds (OR, 8.65; 95% CI, 4.75-15.77;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001). High-intensity binge drinking was associated with approximately triple the odds of clinically high TC for level II (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.59-5.35;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001) and level III (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.71-5.11;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001). The LFTs ALT, AST, and GGT showed similar binge-dependent responses: levels II and III consumption were associated with increased odds of clinically high LFTs by factors of 5 to 8 times the reference nonbinge level (eg, for GGT: level II OR, 5.83; 95% CI, 4.04-8.42 and level III OR, 8.21; 95% CI, 5.90-11.43;   P  \u2009<\u2009.001). \n   Odds Ratios (ORs) With 95% CIs for Clinically High Lipid and Liver Function Test Biomarkers by Alcohol Binge Levels  \nSignificance was set at adjusted Bonferroni threshold   P  \u2009<\u2009.001.

Additionally, each binge level was associated with a stepwise increase in the odds of clinically high lipid and LFT levels. The association between alcohol consumption and cholesterol and TRG metabolism is well documented.  Heavy alcohol consumption has been shown to contribute to hepatic steatosis  and is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, possibly from increased chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein levels.  While the association between alcohol consumption and increased HDL-C levels has been previously described,  our study is the first, to our knowledge, to report an association between HIBD and increased odds of extremely high HDL-C levels. Recent population-based studies have found a U-shaped association between HDL-C and all-cause mortality,  with 1 study  showing that men with HDL-C levels greater than 100 mg/dL had a 36% increased risk of all-cause mortality and women with HDL-C levels greater than 116 mg/dL had a 10% increased risk of all-cause mortality. While additional studies are needed to confirm such associations, our results suggest extremely high HDL-C may be an indirect marker of recent heavy alcohol consumption, which, given the association between alcohol consumption pattern and all-cause mortality risk,  may explain, in part, the increase in all-cause mortality associated with extremely high HDL-C.  Adverse cardiovascular effects from binge drinking are likely mediated by many physiological changes,  and it is well known that an approximately 10% increase in LDL-C is associated with a 20% increase atherosclerosis risk.  Given previous literature  reporting an association of binge drinking, but not daily moderate alcohol consumption, with proatherogenic LDL-C (including Liu et al,  who found that even when total alcohol consumption is the same, mice consuming alcohol in a binge pattern, compared with mice consuming daily moderate alcohol, had increased LDL-C levels with concomitant increase in atherosclerotic plaque development), we expected to find an association between HIBD and the odds of high levels of LDL-C. However, our results were not significant by the standards of this study. Further work is needed to elucidate the association between drinking patterns and LDL-C. Furthermore, we found each additional HIBD day was associated with clinically high circulating lipid and LFT levels, even after controlling for total alcohol consumption during the previous 90 days. While the association between HIBD and CVD is unknown, studies have found that people who drink in binges have higher rates of coronary heart disease  and other CVD, including sudden cardiac death,  compared with people reporting regular alcohol consumption. Since HIBD is common on weekends, sporting events, holidays, and special occasions,  our results suggest HIBD, even occasionally, may have health implications. \n\nThe association between HIBD and LFTs is consistent with previous studies  that have identified positive associations between alcohol and LFTs, including a recent mendelian randomization study  suggesting a possible causal relationship. The significant increase in mean LFT levels from participants drinking at nonbinge levels and those drinking at each binge level suggests a possible hepatic response to HIBD. We found GGT showed the largest increases associated with HIBD, which suggests that GGT may be most sensitive to HIBD. \u03b3-Glutamyltransferase maintains concentrations of glutathione and is important for defense against oxidant stress,  and increased levels indicate antioxidant deficiency  and reactive oxygen species production.  Notably, several population-based studies have shown GGT to be associated CVD mortality.  While evidence linking serum transaminase levels to CVD risk is not as strong as what is observed for GGT,  clinically high ALT levels have been linked to stroke risk  and increased CVD mortality.  Furthermore, circulating levels of hepatic enzymes are considered good indicators of general health and long-term survival,  and unexplained elevations in LFTs constitute a common cause of referral to liver clinics.  Our findings suggest clinical interpretation of LFT findings may benefit from understanding recent drinking history, if deemed appropriate. \n\nOur findings also suggest that drinking reduction interventions and strategies aimed at reducing HIBD to lower drinking levels may be associated with improved health outcomes. Compared with traditional treatment strategies aimed at total abstinence, more recent intervention strategies have widened treatment goals to include reduced alcohol intake.  In our sample, for example, total abstinence may not be an achievable short-term goal for individuals in level III; however, our findings show that reducing consumption to level II or level I may be associated with improved biomarker levels, which could have a health impact. Studies have shown the benefit of alcohol reduction on lipid and LFT levels,  slower progression in alcohol-related liver fibrosis,  and improved psychological well-being.  Therefore, further studies are needed to examine the health effects of reducing HIBD to lower drinking levels. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has limitations. First, the study was cross-sectional, which limits the assessment of causal relationships. We are also unable to draw any conclusions regarding the contribution of HIBD to CVD and liver disease. Second, because data came from volunteers participating in NIAAA screening protocols or seeking treatment for alcohol dependence, selection bias may be present, which may affect the results. Relatedly, the study cohort is not a random sample and results may not be representative of the general population. Third, the participants with alcohol dependence composing a majority of the HIBD groups may not be representative of individuals who engage in binge drinking in the population. However, Hingson et al  found alcohol dependence to be the most robust predictor of HIBD in a nationally representative sample, and a positive response to the question, \u201cOn any single occasion during the past 3 months, have you had more than 5 drinks containing alcohol?\u201d has been shown to accurately detect alcohol abuse and dependence,  suggesting an association between HIBD and alcohol dependence in the general population. Similarly, the HIBD groups were older than the nonbinge group, and given that HIBD is prevalent among young adults,  further studies are necessary to better understand the long-term effects of HIBD on circulating lipid levels and liver function in young adults. In addition, self-reported alcohol consumption data are prone to social desirability and recall biases,  which could affect binge group composition. Fourth, there is the possibility of measurement bias due to admission procedure at the NIAAA inpatient treatment program: blood measurements for treatment-seeking participants were taken the day after admission, while they were obtained during the outpatient screening visit for the healthy volunteers. Fifth, while we adjusted for age, race, and BMI in the analyses, other residual confounders, including nutrition, diet, smoking status, and physical activity, may bias the multivariable estimates. Additionally, some studies  have shown an interaction between BMI and alcohol consumption with LFTs; however, in this study, BMI did not significantly differ between alcohol binge levels, and we controlled for BMI in the multivariable analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nHigh-intensity binge drinking was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid and LFT levels. Multivariable analysis controlling for total alcohol consumption suggested that an additional day of level II or level III drinking was associated with increased odds of clinically high levels of HDL-C, TC, ALT, AST, and GGT. Our results provide support for the notion that the recent alarming trend in HIBD may have negative health consequences, as measured by lipid and LFT biomarkers. Further research is warranted to assess additional clinical implications. Similarly, in accordance with harm reduction approaches to alcohol consumption, our findings suggest interventions targeted at reducing HIBD may be important in improving health outcomes. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6575145, "text_md5": "039293fe82bcbf253b78afb2065d0336", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 168], "journal": [169, 183], "publication_year": [185, 189], "title": [200, 288], "keywords": [302, 302], "abstract": [315, 4050], "body": [4059, 27339]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31199452, "doi": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.5844", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6575145", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6575145"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6575145\">6575145</a>", "list_title": "PMC6575145  Association of High-Intensity Binge Drinking With Lipid and Liver Function Enzyme Levels"}

There is an urgent need for effective preventive measures for ARHL because none are currently available. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging disease that presents with progressive hearing loss at a young age, but is otherwise similar to ARHL. There are two human genetic complementation groups of CS, A and B. While the clinical phenotypes in patients are similar, the proteins have very diverse functions, and insight into their convergence is of great interest. Here, we use mouse models for CS (  CSA   and   CSB  ) that recapitulate the hearing loss in human CS patients. We previously showed that NAD , a key metabolite with various essential functions, is reduced in CS and associated with multiple CS phenotypes. In this study, we report that NAD  levels are reduced in the cochlea of   CSB   mice and that short-term treatment (10 days) with the NAD  precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), prevents hearing loss, restores outer hair cell loss, and improves cochlear health in   CSB   mice. Similar, but more modest effects were observed in   CSA   mice. Remarkably, we observed a reduction in synaptic ribbon counts in the presynaptic zones of inner hair cells in both   CSA   and   CSB   mice, pointing to a converging mechanism for cochlear defects in CS. Ribbon synapses facilitate rapid and sustained synaptic transmission over long periods of time. Ribeye, a core protein of synaptic ribbons, possesses an NAD(H) binding pocket which regulates its activity. Intriguingly, NAD  supplementation rescues reduced synaptic ribbon formation in both   CSA   and   CSB   mutant cochleae. These findings provide valuable insight into the mechanism of CS- and ARHL-associated hearing loss, and suggest a possible intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHearing loss is one of the most prominent age-associated conditions. Its prevalence almost doubles every decade starting from adult life and affects up to 80% of individuals over the age of 85.  There are two major types of hearing loss: conductive and sensorineural. Any damage or obstruction that prevents sound from being conducted into the inner ear is considered conductive hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss derives from deficits in sensory cells or auditory nerves of the inner ear. A common type of sensorineural hearing loss is age-related hearing loss (ARHL), which occurs progressively in individuals as they age.  Despite its high prevalence and cost, there are no interventions that prevent ARHL. \n\nCockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging disorder with prominent sensorineural hearing loss, similar to ARHL.  CS is primarily caused by mutations in CSA and CSB proteins that participate in various biological processes including DNA repair, transcription, and mitochondrial functions.  Hearing loss is a cardinal clinical symptom of CS, affecting up to 80% of CS patients by age 10.  Hearing loss in CS resembles ARHL as both are bilateral, sensorineural, and progressive. Mouse models of CS (  CSA   and   CSB  ) recapitulate the progressive hearing loss and manifest sensory hair cell degeneration seen in the patients.  Notably, hearing loss progression is slower in   CSA   than in   CSB   mice, reflecting the situation in CS patients. \n\nOur lab recently reported that the reduced abundance of nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD ) in CS cells (patient-derived fibroblasts) and mice are associated with key CS phenotypes.  NAD  is a critical cofactor for several enzymes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and energy metabolism.  It is likely that persistent DNA damage, observed in CS, constitutively activates poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (Parp1), which in turn depletes the cellular pool of NAD .  NAD  declines with age and treatment with exogenous NAD  improves mitochondrial function and life span in mice.  Here, we investigate the relationship between NAD  levels and hearing loss in CS mice. CS mice had lower levels of NAD  so they were dosed with nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD  precursor. NR has been shown to elevate cellular NAD  levels in the cochlea and reduce neurite degeneration in auditory cells in mice following noise-induced damage. \n\nHearing-related outcome measures used in this study included auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPAOE). ABR measures the fluctuation in voltage reflecting a neuronal response to sound, and DPOAE quantifies the electromotility of outer hair cells in the cochlea. The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear and is composed of several cell types including inner and outer hair cells.  Inner hair cells transduce sound vibration into electrical activity to be relayed into auditory nerve cells, while outer hair cells mechanically amplify low-level sound. \n\nWe find that NAD  levels were reduced in the cochlea of   CSB   mice and that a brief intervention with NR (only 10 days) rescues progressive high-frequency hearing loss, improves outer hair cell survival, and normalizes DPAOEs in   CSB   mice. We observed similar but more modest effects on hearing loss in   CSA   mice following NAD  intervention. Remarkably, we detected reduced numbers of synaptic ribbons in inner hair cells in both   CSA   and   CSB   mice, which were normalized after NAD  supplementation. The assembly and function of synaptic ribbons in inner hair cells, which facilitate high vesicle turnover,  are modulated by NAD  and NADH.  Therefore, these results provide insight into a converging mechanism underlying hearing loss in   CSA   and   CSB   mice, which may be similar to the mechanism underlying hearing loss in humans. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Hearing in NR-treated CS mouse genotypes \n  \nWe previously reported that reduced NAD  levels are associated with CS pathology.  Given that hearing loss is a cardinal symptom of CS, we assayed NAD  levels in the cochlea of   CSB   mice. We found that total NAD  and relative NAD /NADH levels were lower in the cochlea of the   CSB   mice compared to WT (Fig.  ). In this study, CS mice were dosed with NR, an NAD  precursor, to assess the effect of NAD  supplementation on progressive hearing loss in CS mouse genotypes. We began treating mice with NR just after 5 weeks of age and assessed hearing capacity by measuring ABRs (see Methods for details) in response to sound at multiple frequencies (Fig.  ). We observed that   CSB   mice at 6.5 weeks of age develop a progressive hearing impairment and have a hearing loss of more than 35\u2009dB at 32\u2009kHz compared to WT (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ). Strikingly, only 10 days of exposure to NR (12\u2009mM) significantly prevented the hearing loss in   CSB   mice and reduced the high-frequency hearing threshold from 77 to 40\u2009dB (Fig.  , compare top and lower panels). We then compared the hearing threshold shift in individual mice in NR-treated and non-treated groups. We observed that non-treated   CSB   mice at 6.5 weeks of age, on average, lost 12\u2009dB over 10 days and the treatment with NR not only prevented hearing loss, but improved hearing by an average of 15\u2009dB (Fig.  ).    NAD  supplementation prevents progressive hearing loss in   CSB   mice.  \n a   Total NAD  levels per mg of the cochlea and relative NAD /NADH levels were measured in the cochlea of   CSB   and WT (6-month-old) mice (  N  \u2009=\u20093). Two-tailed   t  -tests were used to determine significant difference.   b   Outline for NR treatment and ABR recordings in   CSB   mice.   c   ABR thresholds for   CSB   and WT mice following a 10-day treatment with NR (12\u2009mM) delivered via drinking water. A total of 21 mice (  CSB   (  N  \u2009=\u20097);   CSB   + NR (  N  \u2009=\u20096); WT (  N  \u2009=\u20094); WT + NR (  N  \u2009=\u20094)) were tested by ABR at 5 weeks of age and again following the 10-day treatment (6.5 weeks of age). Multiple graphs are used to visualize error bars on each dataset. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine significant difference.   d   Treatment with NR (12\u2009mM) prevents the increased threshold shift observed in   CSB   mice between 5 weeks and 6.5 weeks at 32\u2009kHz. Note: ABR data in   c   at 5 and 6.5 weeks of age were used to calculate the hearing shift. Two-way ANOVA with uncorrected Fisher's LSD post-hoc test was used to determine significant difference. \n  \n\nLike   CSB  ,   CSA   mice also manifested progressive hearing loss although less severe  (Supplementary Fig.  ). This less severe phenotype has also been reported in CSA patients.  We found that NAD /NADH levels were also lower in the cochlea of   CSA   mice (Fig.  ) and tested the effect of NAD  supplementation on the hearing defect in   CSA   mice (Fig.  ). Initial treatment with 12\u2009mM dose of NR did not attenuate the hearing loss in these mice (Supplementary Fig.  ) and thus we increased the dose of NR (24\u2009mM) over a 4-week period from 5 to 9 weeks of age. After exposure to 24\u2009mM NR, the ABR threshold at 32\u2009kHz for   CSA   decreased by ~25\u2009dB (Fig.  , compare top and lower panels). During this 4-week period, non-treated   CSA   mice developed an average of 28\u2009dB of hearing loss while the hearing threshold in NR-treated   CSA   mice was elevated only 6\u2009dB, which is not considered as hearing loss (<10\u2009dB) (Fig.  ). These results collectively suggest that NAD  supplementation strongly reduces hearing loss in both   CSA   and   CSB   mice.    NAD  supplementation prevents progressive hearing loss in   CSA   mice.  \n a   NAD /NADH levels were measured in   CSA   (7-month-old) mice (  N  \u2009=\u20093). Two-tailed   t  -tests were used to determine significant difference.   b   Outline for NR treatment and ABR recordings in   CSA   mice.   c   ABR thresholds of   CSA   and WT mice following 4 weeks of NR treatment (24\u2009mM) in their drinking water. Total of 19 mice (  CSA   (  N  \u2009=\u20096);   CSA  \u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20095); WT (  N  \u2009=\u20094); WT\u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20094)) were used to measure ABR at the age of 5 weeks (before NR treatment) and 9 weeks (after NR treatment).   CSA   mice do not show a significant threshold shift at any frequency at 5 weeks of age. However, at 9 weeks,   CSA   mice show an approximately 20-dB shift by comparison with WT. Multiple graphs are used to visualize error bars on each dataset. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used in to determine significant difference.   d   A significant threshold shift is present in   CSA   mice and WT at 32\u2009kHz. Treatment with NR (24\u2009mM) induced a significant rescue of the age-related threshold shift in   CSA   and WT mice. ABR data in   c   at 5 and 9 weeks of age were used to calculate the hearing shift. Two-way ANOVA with uncorrected Fisher's LSD post-hoc test was used to determine significant difference. \n  \n\n\n### Outer hair cells in NR-treated CS mouse genotypes \n  \nTo gain more insight into the mechanisms by which NR reduces hearing loss in CS mouse genotypes, we assessed auditory capacity with DPOAE assay, an approach that provides information about cochlear integrity and outer hair cell function. The results show that   CSB   mice at 12 weeks of age have lower DPOAE signals than WT mice at 16\u2009kHz (Fig.  , left panel), but not at 10 and 12\u2009kHz (Supplementary Fig.  ). This decrease at 16\u2009kHz was normalized by exposure to NR (Fig.  , middle panel), suggesting that NAD  supplementation improves outer hair cell function in   CSB   mice at 16\u2009kHz. In the   CSA   mice at 9 weeks of age, the DPOAE response was similar to WT mice for all frequencies tested, suggesting that outer hair cell function in 9-week-old   CSA   mice are intact and functional (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ).    Short-term NR supplementation restores reduced DPOAE levels in   CSB   mice at 16\u2009kHz.  \n a   NR intervention (12\u2009mM of NR for 7 weeks) corrects reduced DPOAEs in   CSB   mice at 12 weeks of age at 16\u2009kHz (  CSB   (  N  \u2009=\u20095);   CSB  \u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20093); WT (  N  \u2009=\u20097); WT\u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20096)). Multiple graphs are used to visualize error bars in each dataset.   b   DPOAE levels in   CSA   and WT at 9 weeks of age (  CSA   (  N  \u2009=\u20096);   CSA  \u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20095); WT (  N  \u2009=\u20093); WT\u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20094)) were recorded at 16\u2009kHz following 4 weeks of NR treatment (24\u2009mM) in their drinking water. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E. is shown in all graphs. Multiple graphs are used to visualize error bars on each dataset. The input in dB/output in dB functions in the range from 50\u2009dB SPL to 60\u2009dB SPL input were used to perform statistical analysis on groups, followed by a linear mixed-effect model on repeated-measures of DPOAEs in each group. \n  \n\nSensorineural hearing loss arises specifically from degenerative and functional changes in cochlear hair and auditory nerve cells, and loss of their synaptic connections.  Next, we assessed the degenerative changes in cochlear hair cells in   CSB   and   CSA   mice via cochlear histology analysis. The cochlea is composed of base, middle, and apex regions; the base region senses high-frequency and the apex region senses low-frequency sounds. Since hearing loss in CS mice was restricted to high frequencies (Fig.  ), we focused on the basal region of the cochlea, although middle and apical regions were also analyzed (see Methods for details). Hair cell numbers in each area correlate with the hearing capacity for specific frequency ranges. To investigate the influence of NR on hair cell number and function, cochleae were isolated and stained with an antibody to Myo7a, a hair cell marker. There were significantly fewer outer hair cells in the basal cochlear region in   CSB   mice than in WT (Fig.  ), while middle and apex regions were largely unaffected (Supplementary Fig.  ). This observation is consistent with the ABR data showing high-frequency hearing loss in   CSB   mice. Exposure to NR normalized outer hair cell numbers in the base cochlear region in   CSB   mice (Fig.  ). The outer hair cell number was also reduced in the base cochlear region in   CSA   mice but did not increase significantly after treatment with NR (Fig.  ). As was the case for   CSB  , the numbers of outer hair cells in the apical and middle regions of the cochleae in   CSA   mice were not affected, which is consistent with our DPOAE and ABR results at lower frequencies (Supplementary Fig.  ). These results suggest that NAD  supplementation restores outer hair cell number specifically in   CSB   mice.    Outer hair cells are reduced in   CSA   and   CSB   mice, and short-term NR supplementation rescues outer hair cell loss in   CSB   mice.  \n a   Summary data for the average number of outer (left) and inner (right) hair cells per 100\u2009\u03bcm in the basal region of the cochlea in WT or   CSB   mice with and without NR treatment (12\u2009mM in drinking water for 10 days) at 6.5 weeks of age. The decreased number of outer hair cells observed in   CSB   mice is prevented by NR treatment. In contrast, no changes in the number of inner hair cells were observed between conditions.   N  \u2009=\u20094; mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E.; two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine significant difference.   b   Representative images of outer and inner hair cells in the cochlear base region of   CSB   and WT mice following NR treatment as described in   a  . Myo7a staining is used to identify hair cells.   c   Outer hair cells were reduced in base region in   CSA   mice (  CSA   (  N  \u2009=\u20094);   CSA  \u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20093); WT (  N  \u2009=\u20094); WT\u2009+\u2009NR (  N  \u2009=\u20095)).

Myo7a staining is used to identify hair cells. \n  \n\n\n### Ribbon synapses in NR-treated CS mouse genotypes \n  \nThe number of inner hair cells in all regions of the cochlea was similar in WT,   CSA  , and   CSB   mice (Fig.  , right panels). We therefore next investigated the integrity of synaptic transmission between the inner hair cells and afferent neurons affecting the hearing loss in CS mouse genotypes. Inner hair cells form a specialized synapse, ribbon synapse, which provides rapid and sustained synaptic transmission.  The function of ribbon synapses relies on the formation of unique electron-dense structures called synaptic ribbons, which are regarded as an accurate metric of inner hair cell afferent innervation.  Interestingly, the major component of the synaptic ribbons is the protein Ribeye, which is important for the function and physical integrity of ribbon synapses, and it possesses a binding pocket for NAD(H).  It has been shown that NAD(H) binding to Ribeye modulates the dimerization of Ribeye monomers to build the synaptic ribbon.  Therefore, we tested whether NAD  supplementation impacts ribbon formation in CS. We isolated cochleae and stained them with anti-Ctbp2 (Ribeye). Immunolabeling was quantified by counting ribbon-forming puncta in inner hair cells of WT,   CSA  , and   CSB   mice. Compared to WT mice,   CSA   and   CSB   mice exhibited a significant reduction in ribbon counts of inner hair cells in the basal region of the cochlea, suggesting a defect in synaptic transmission in both genotypes of CS mouse (Figs.   and  ). Remarkably, treatment with NR normalized ribbon counts in the same cochlear region of   CSA   and   CSB   mice (Figs.   and  ). Synaptic ribbons were also reduced in the middle and apex cochlear regions in   CSA   and   CSB   mice, respectively (Figs.   and  ). After intervention with NR, synaptic ribbons were normalized in the apex region in   CSB   but not in   CSA   mice. NR had no impact on the middle cochlear ribbons in either mouse strain (Figs.   and  ). Although NR reduced hearing loss in WT mice (Fig.  ), intervention with NR did not alter inner hair cell number/synaptic ribbon count in WT mice (Fig.  ). Collectively, these results suggest that NR intervention restores impaired ribbon synapse formation, thereby improving synaptic transmission during the cochlear response to auditory stimuli to rescue high-frequency hearing loss in both genotypes of CS mouse.

Here we sought to quantify hearing changes in CS mouse models and interrogate the potential utility of NAD  supplementation. The results support the following conclusions: (1) Hearing loss progresses in   CSA   and   CSB   mice at high frequencies and short-term exposure to NR normalizes the ABR threshold at 32\u2009kHz in   CSA   and   CSB   mice; (2) fewer outer hair cells are detected in the basal region of cochleae from   CSA   and   CSB   mice than in WT cochlea, and NR normalizes this phenotype in   CSB   mice; (3) the abundance of synaptic ribbons are lower in the base cochlear region from   CSA   and   CSB   mice than in control WT mice, and NR normalizes this phenotype in   CSA   and   CSB   mice. Although the hearing loss phenotype and its response to NR in WT and CS mice are complex, the data presented here support the idea that NAD  depletion plays an important role in the etiology of age-dependent hearing loss in these mice. \n\nCSA patients generally have a milder form of the disease than CSB patients.  This is also recapitulated in the CSA mouse model which has less severe features than the CSB mouse.  Importantly, both   CSA   and   CSB   mice show a dose-dependent reduction/normalization of hearing loss after exposure to NR (Supplementary Figs.   and  ). We next examined if there is a change in cochlear histology along with hearing loss prevention in NR-treated CS mice. To that end, we found that reduced DPOAEs in   CSB   mice at 16\u2009kHz at 12 weeks of age were restored with NR (Fig.  ). In line with the DPOAE results, we observed a reduction in the number of outer hair cells in the base turn of   CSB   cochlea at 6.5 weeks of age, and NR treatment rescued this abnormality (Fig.  ). NAD  supplementation corrects multiple aspects of mitochondrial abnormalities in the cerebellum of   CSB   mice.  Perhaps, the same phenomenon occurs in   CSB   cochlea as well, enhancing outer hair cell survival via improving mitochondrial homeostasis. Interestingly, although there is a significant reduction of outer hair cells in the base region of   CSA   cochlea, this defect was not reflected in DPOAE levels in   CSA   mice (Figs.   and  ). It is possible that loss of outer hair cells in   CSA   mice was compensated with increased function of nearby outer hair cells, thereby elevating DPOAEs. Nevertheless, unlike in   CSB   mice, NR treatment did not have a significant impact either on outer hair cells or on DPOAEs in   CSA   mice, suggesting that hearing benefits of NR treatment in this genotype does not include outer hair cell function or survival. \n\nDespite the dramatic hearing loss, the number of inner hair cells was largely unaffected in CS mice cochleae. Therefore, we assessed synaptic connectivity between inner hair cells and innervating afferent neurons. We observed that there were reduced synaptic ribbon (Ribeye) counts in the base turn of   CSA   and   CSB   cochlea compared to WT mice, suggesting that defects in the ribbon synapses might be a converging mechanism leading to hearing loss in CS. The reduction of synaptic ribbon count in inner hair cells was 11% in   CSA   mice by the age of 9 weeks and 21% in   CSB   mice by the age of 6.5 weeks at high frequencies (Figs.   and  ). This amount of reduction in the synaptic ribbon counts occurs at approximately 32 and 80 weeks of age in mice with normal aging, respectively.  Remarkably, NR intervention significantly corrected the reduced ribbon counts in both   CSA   and   CSB   cochlear inner hair cells (Figs.   and  ). We conclude that depleted NAD  levels due to deficiency of CS proteins disrupt synaptic ribbon assembly and function in inner hair cells. Thus, NAD  supplementation may improve inner hair cell function via affecting ribbon synapses. This scenario is also consistent with the dramatic benefits of NR on hearing loss with short treatment duration (only 10 days) as replenishing NAD  might exert its beneficial effect rapidly on synaptic ribbons and improve hearing. It is worth noting that synaptic ribbons are also present in cells of the retina.  Interestingly, retinal dystrophy is another clinical feature of CS , and NAD  intervention protects against retinal degeneration in mice.  Collectively, our results suggest that NAD  supplementation via NR has distinct targets including synaptic ribbon formation in inner hair cells and the rescue of outer hair cell loss in CS cochlea (Fig.  ).    Figure demonstrating that NR intervention enhances synaptic ribbon formation in inner hair cells of   CSA   and   CSB   mice (arrow #1), and prevents outer hair cell loss in   CSB   mice (arrow #2).  \nOHC stands for outer hair cells. IHC stands for inner hair cells. \n  \n\nWe previously reported that NAD  supplementation can activate Sirt1 and rescue CS-related phenotypes.  Sirt1 is a NAD -dependent protein deacetylase and is known to have protective effects against aging-associated degeneration.  Notably, Sirt1 expression also declines in the mouse cochlea during aging and its overexpression protects cochlear hair cells and delays early-onset ARHL. Given that Sirt1 activation is attenuated in   CSB   patient fibroblasts,  the benefits of NAD  supplementation on hearing in CS might also be mediated by Sirt1 activation. Indeed, Sirt1 activation by resveratrol treatment prevents outer hair cell loss and rescues the reduced synaptic ribbon counts in inner hair cells upon aging.  Future studies exploring the CSB-Sirt1-NAD axis in the context of hearing loss are warranted as the role of Sirt1 on cochlear function is still a subject of debate. \n\nNR is generally recognized as safe for use in dietary supplements and well-tolerated up to 1000\u2009g daily in humans for 6 weeks.  Recent human clinical reports suggested potential benefits of NR intervention on improving redox homeostasis and exercise performance while reducing systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness.  Our study provides a rationale for exploring NR as a potential therapeutic approach for both accelerated and normal sensorineural hearing loss in humans. Hearing loss in CS resembles ARHL as both are sensorineural and progressive rather than congenital. Therefore, NAD  supplementation might provide protective effects on hearing loss during aging as well. Indeed, the results presented here show that NR (24\u2009mM dose) protects against hearing loss above 20\u2009dB in WT mice (Fig.  ). With the increasing prevalence of hearing loss in the aging population and the lack of therapeutic approaches for its treatment, the results of this study could ultimately, once successfully translated to the clinical arena, have a large public health impact. However, given that the cellular bioavailability of NAD  declines upon aging,  chronic NR supplementation may be necessary to achieve its full benefits. Notably, the hearing defect and beneficial results of the intervention are seen in both   CSA   and   CSB   mice. The proteins have very different functions that converge in our studies and thus may explain fundamental issues related to the CS disorder. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Animals \n  \nMouse models of   CSA   (knockout mice),  CSB   (mice carrying a premature stop codon in exon 5 to mimic the K337 stop truncation mutation from CS patient (CS1AN)),  and wild-type (WT) on a C57BL/6J background in the range of 5\u201312 weeks of age were used for the auditory and histology experiments. Six- or 7-month-old mice were used for quantifying NAD  levels in the cochlea. The NR treatment started at the age of 5 weeks for both CS mice models right after auditory assessment. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, in accordance with the National Research Council\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. \n\n\n### NAD  supplementation \n  \nUnless stated otherwise,   CSB   mice were given NR at 3.5\u2009mg/ml (12\u2009mM) for 10 days and   CSA   mice were given NR at 7\u2009mg/ml (24\u2009mM) for 4 weeks in their drinking water, while the non-treated control groups received only drinking water. The drinking water supply was replenished/changed twice per week. A total of 1000\u2009mg of NR daily supplementation for 6 weeks at this dose is well-tolerated in humans and effectively increases blood cellular NAD  concentrations.  The average 6\u2009ml daily water intake of C57BL/6J mouse at an early age corresponds to the average of 21\u2009mg (0.51\u2009mg/kg) or 42\u2009mg (1.02\u2009mg/kg) daily NR intake in   CSB   and   CSA   mice, respectively.  Given the difference in weight/surface area between human and mice,  the range of 0.51\u20131.02\u2009mg/kg of NR in mice corresponds to the range of 2.48\u20134.96\u2009mg/kg of NR in humans, which is under the tolerated levels for NR consumption and is higher than the concentration needed to increase whole-blood NAD . \n\n\n### NAD  quantification \n  \nFollowing dissection in cold PBS, cochleae were weighed and placed in NADH/NAD Extraction Buffer (Abcam, ab65348). Following homogenization with a micro pestle, an NAD/NADH Assay Kit (Abcam, ab65348) was used to quantify NAD  and NADH levels. Two technical replicates were performed on   n  \u2009=\u20093 mice per condition; data were normalized to cochlear weight. \n\n\n### Audiometry \n  \nThe ABR assay is a quantitative assessment of the neurological response, measured as evoked potential, detected within 10\u2009ms of an auditory stimulus. ABR assays were performed on mice anesthetized with ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) via an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, placed on a heating pad 7\u2009cm from the sound source, an MF1 Multi-Field Magnetic Speaker, in a soundproof chamber. Needle electrodes were inserted sub-dermally (vertex\u2013ventrolateral to pinna). Tone burst stimuli (5\u2009ms duration with a 0.1-ms rise\u2013fall time) were presented at variable volume (10\u201390\u2009dB SPL) in 5\u2009dB steps at 4, 8, 16, and 32\u2009kHz. The outcome measure is the minimum volume threshold (in dB) that evokes a response at each frequency tested. For each frequency, the threshold was determined by an average of 512 responses. ABR threshold was determined by visual inspection of the averaged waveforms. The threshold was considered to be the lowest stimulus level at which at least one wave was considered to be present. The threshold was the lowest dB stimulus that evoked at least one response wave. ABR assays were performed using an RZ6 system (Tucker Davis Technologies) with Biosig software (Tucker Davis Technologies). \n\nDPOAE quantifies the electromotility of outer hair cells in the cochlea. DPOAEs were measured by inserting an ear-plug containing a small microphone (ER-10B+) and two speakers (MF1 Multi-Field Magnetic Speaker), in the outer ear canal of each mouse. A series of auditory stimuli were delivered, each composed of two tones at equal decibel level but distinct frequencies,   f  1 and   f  2, where   f  2\u2009>\u2009  f  1,   f  2/  f  1\u2009=\u20091.2) at   f  0\u2009=\u200910, 12, 16, and 32\u2009kHz (  f  0\u2009=\u2009(  f  1\u2009\u00d7\u2009  f  2)1/2). Decibel level of both tones varied over the range 80\u2009dB SPL to 10\u2009dB SPL in 5-dB steps. The cubic distortion product at the frequency 2  f  1\u2009\u2212\u2009  f  2 was recorded as an average of 512 responses at each frequency tested. DPOAE measurements were made using the RZ6 system (Tucker Davis Technologies) with Biosig software. \n\n\n### Whole-mount cochlea immunostaining \n  \nEntire otic capsules were dissected and decalcified in a 0.25\u2009M EDTA solution that was changed daily for 5\u20137 days. Subsequently, cochleae were dissected and divided into the apex, middle, and basal turns. Following decalcification and dissection, apex, middle, and basal turns of cochlea were blocked for 1\u2009h with gentle agitation at room temperature in PBS, 20% triton X-100 (1:200), 10% normal donkey serum, and donkey anti-mouse fab fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., catalog #715-007-003, 1:200) with agitation. The primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were Myo7a (rabbit, Proteus Biosciences Inc., catalog #25-6790, 1:2000), and Ctbp2 (mouse, BD Biosciences, catalog #612044). After washing, the secondary antibody was added, and samples were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Donkey secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor fluorophores (Fisher Scientific, 1:1000) were used with phalloidin-Atto 390 (Sigma Aldrich, catalog #50556, 1:200) to stain filamentous actin or DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride, catalog #D1306, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:10,000) to label nuclei. Samples were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Labs, catalog# H-1000), then imaged on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope. \n\nThe total cochlear length was measured using ZEISS ZEN Black 2.3 SP1 software. Apex, middle, and base midpoints were assigned as loci at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total length of the cochlea, respectively. Hair cell counts were quantified in 100-\u03bcm segments of the total cochlea for all regions (manual counting). For segments with damaged or immeasurable tissue, the nearest 150\u2009\u00b5m of intact tissue was used. For synaptic counts, the number of presynaptic terminals in 15 inner hair cells was determined. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nTwo-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine significant differences across multiple samples with two groups unless indicated otherwise. Two-way ANOVA with uncorrected Fisher's LSD post-hoc test was used to determine the significant difference in the hearing threshold when a comparison between groups was not involved. One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine significant differences across multiple samples in more than two groups. Two-tailed   t  -tests were used to compare single groups. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The area under the curve across the whole dB SPL (  f  2) above the noise levels and a linear mixed-effect model for repeated-measures of DPOAE with multiple comparisons at the range of 50\u201360\u2009dB SPL (  f  2) were employed to determine significant analysis for DPOAE levels between groups and both methods provided the same results. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the   linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6946667, "text_md5": "48432918af0af96adb213ad7f077b2ec", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 229], "journal": [230, 248], "publication_year": [250, 254], "title": [265, 355], "keywords": [369, 403], "abstract": [416, 2256], "body": [2265, 35449]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31934345, "doi": "10.1038/s41514-019-0040-z", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946667", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6946667"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946667\">6946667</a>", "list_title": "PMC6946667  Short-term NAD+ supplementation prevents hearing loss in mouse models of Cockayne syndrome"}

Chromatin is implicated in contributing to the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression . Fully understanding the mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity requires simultaneous measurement of RNA and occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors on chromatin due to their critical roles in transcriptional regulation . We generally term the occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors as Chromatin occupancy. Here, we report a technique, termed scPCOR-seq (  s  ingle-  c  ell   P  rofiling of   C  hromatin   O  ccupancy and   R  NAs   S  equencing), for simultaneously profiling genome-wide chromatin protein binding or histone modification marks and RNA expression in the same cell. We demonstrated that scPCOR-seq can profile either H3K4me3 or RNAPII and RNAs in a mixture of human H1, GM12878 and 293\u2009T cells at a single-cell resolution and either H3K4me3, RNAPII, or RNA profile can correctly separate the cells. Application of scPCOR-seq to the in vitro differentiation of the erythrocyte precursor CD36 cells from human CD34 stem or progenitor cells revealed that H3K4me3 and RNA exhibit distinct properties in clustering cells during differentiation. Overall, our work provides a promising approach to understand the relationships among different omics layers. \n  \nscPCOR-seq is a single-cell sequencing technique that enables simultaneous profiling of genome-wide chromatin protein binding or histone modification marks and RNA expression in the same cell. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGene expression exhibits remarkable cellular heterogeneity, which may be influenced by multiple factors including different aspects of chromatin modifications . In the past few years, several assays measuring different aspects of chromatin states at a single-cell resolution have been developed. These include Droplet-based single-cell ChIP-seq , Tn5-based chromatin accessibility assays (ATAC-seq) , DNase I hypersensitivity assay(DNase-seq) , MNase-based nucleosome position and chromatin accessibility assay (scMNase-seq) , immunocleavage-based histone modification assays (Cut&Run, scChIC-seq) , antibody-guided Tn5 chromatin tagging assays (ACT-seq, Cut&Tag, CoBATCH) , and NOMe-seq assay . These assays measure one or more aspects of chromatin states and provided data on cellular heterogeneity in chromatin but do not directly measure simultaneously both RNA and chromatin in the same single cell. \n\nTo directly investigate the mechanisms that may regulate the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression, several laboratories have reported the techniques for co-profiling of both RNA and chromatin accessibility by combining single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq , providing powerful tools to investigate how chromatin accessibility contributes to cellular heterogeneity in the same single cell. Since chromatin states are controlled by multiple mechanisms including various histone modifications and chromatin binding proteins, it will be important to examine the RNA expression and histone modifications or chromatin binding profiles in the same cell. \n\n\n## Results and discussion \n  \n### Experimental procedure \n  \nWe previously developed an indexing single-cell ChIC-seq protocol to profile histone modifications  in which Terminal Transferase was used to mediate dG tailing on MNase digestion sites, meanwhile oligo-dC protruding barcode adaptors were ligated to these sites by T4 Ligase. Based on the above strategy, we developed scPCOR-seq (  s  ingle-  c  ell   P  rofiling of   C  hromatin   O  ccupancy and   R  NAs   S  equencing), for simultaneously profiling genome-wide chromatin protein binding or histone modification marks and RNA expression in the same cell (Note that \u201cchromatin occupancy\u201d here refers to the bindings of histone modifications or DNA binding proteins). To capture both histone modification or DNA binding proteins on chromatin and RNA in the same cell, we devised a strategy to detect RNA profiles simultaneously (Fig.\u00a0 ). Briefly, Protein A-MNase (PA-MNase) was guided by specific antibodies to the targeted sites in formaldehyde-fixed cells. Following Ca -activated MNase digestion of chromatin, in-situ reverse transcription was performed by Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase along with oligodT primer and a mixture of 749 not-so-random primers that do not recognize rRNAs (see \u201cMethods\u201d and Supplementary Data\u00a0  for details). Then both the MNase-digested sites and cDNA were tailed simultaneously by Terminal Transferase and ligated with barcode adaptors in 96-well plate. The cells were pooled and sorted into a new 96-well plate with 30 cells per well by flow cytometry sorting, followed by two consecutive rounds of indexed PCR and final library sequencing. Single cells were resolved by identifying the unique combinations of barcodes and indexes as previously reported .    Description of the experimental steps of scPCOR-seq and its quality.  \n a   A schematic diagram showed the experimental steps of scPCOR-seq.   b   A scatter plot showing the number of reads that mapped to human and mouse genome for RNA reads.   c   A scatter plot showing the number of reads that mapped to human and mouse genome H3K4me3 reads. \n  \n\n\n### Profiling H3K4me3 and RNA in cell lines using scPCOR-seq \n  \nWe first demonstrated the application of scPCOR-seq to profiling H3K4me3 and RNAs in human 293\u2009T cells and mouse NIH 3T3 cells to estimate the detection of doublets. After identifying the barcodes that refer to cells in either RNA or H3K4me3 data, we observed a collision rate of 0.08 in the RNA data (Fig.\u00a0 ) and a collision rate of 0.118 in the H3K4me3 data (Fig.\u00a0 ). The different number of reads in RNA and H3K4me3 may have caused the discrepancy in the collision rate between H3K4me3 and RNA data. However, collision rates obtained in both data suggest that the doublets rate in scPCOR-seq is comparable to previous published single-cell assays . \n\nNext, we first profiled H3K4me3 and RNAs by applying scPCOR-seq to a mixture of human H1 ESCs, 293\u2009T cells, and GM12878 cells. After sequencing the libraries, the RNAs were distinguished from chromatin targets by a unique barcode embedded in the primers used for reverse transcription. In all, 3713 single cells were identified from the sequencing data (~2000 RNA UMI per cell and 45,000 H3K4me3 unique reads per cell, see Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). Because measurement of the H3K4me3 signals on chromatin requires the cleavage of chromatin by pA-MNase recruited to the H3K4me3 target sites by the H3K4me3 antibodies, we first examined whether the detected H3K4me3 reads in the scPCOR-seq libraries are dependent on the specific antibody or simply reflect the chromatin accessibility measured by ATAC-seq. For this purpose, the H3K4me3 reads from the scPCOR-seq data from pooled 293\u2009T single cells were compared to the public bulk 293\u2009T cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data and ATAC-seq data. Overall, 10,868, 10,860, and 10,837 peaks were identified from the bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data, ATAC-seq data and pooled single-cell H3K4me3 data from scPCOR-seq data, respectively. A comparison of these peaks revealed that while 46% of the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks and 47% of the scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with the ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), 73% of the scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with the bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The results indicate that the H3K4me3 data have a higher similarity to the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data than the ATAC-seq data  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The H3K4me3 signals from the pooled 293\u2009T single cells were also compared with the bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data and bulk cell ATAC-seq data at a randomly selected genomic locus (Fig.\u00a0 ). As shown by the highlighted regions, the H3K4me3 signals are more like the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signals than the ATAC-seq signals, consistent with the global analysis above. These results indicate that the H3K4me3 data from scPCOR-seq is specific and is not simply related to chromatin accessibility.

The significance of overlap is determined by the hypergeometric test, which is shown by the color level (negative log of the   p   value). \n  \n\n\n### Three cell types can be identified accurately based on scPCOR-seq data \n  \nThe quality of the single-cell RNA-seq data was quantified by different metrics (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). A median of 1300 (0.65 in terms of fraction) useful UMI (i.e., UMI located within gene regions) were detected per single cell. A median of 700 genes was detected per cell. Similarly, four metrics were used to quantify the quality of H3K4me3 signals. A median of 5400 unique reads (0.12 in terms of fraction) per single-cell were detected within the peaks identified using ENCODE data. A median of 3000 peaks was detected per cell (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results indicate that scPCOR-seq can simultaneously detect histone modification and RNA levels simultaneously at a single-cell resolution. Next, to further validate the scPCOR-seq data, we tested whether the single-cell RNA data or the H3K4me3 data from the assays can separate cells to different clusters. First, the principal component analysis (PCA) was directly applied to the scPCOR-seq RNA and H3K4me3 data separately. UMAP was applied to the reduced dimensions for scRNA and scH3K4me3, separately. Finally, the software MolTi  (multiplex-modularity with the adapted Louvain algorithm to cluster single cells using both RNA and H3K4me3 data. Single cells were separated into three clusters (Cluster 1 in blue, Cluster 2 in red, and Cluster 3 in orange) from each dataset (Fig.\u00a0 ). The clusters were annotated by comparing to the specifically expressed genes (Fig.\u00a0 ) or specific H3K4me3 peaks based on the ENCODE data (Fig.\u00a0 ). The data indicate that Cluster 1, Cluster 2, and Cluster 3 are H1, GM12878, and 293\u2009T cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ). Overall, both the RNA and H3K4me3 data from the scPCOR-seq assay can correctly separate different cell types from a mixture of cells. \n\n\n### Profiling RNAPII and RNA in cell lines using scPCOR-seq \n  \nTo test whether scPCOR-seq can detect DNA binding proteins and RNAs in the same single-cell, we applied it to profiling both RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and RNAs in a mixture of H1 ESCs and 293\u2009T cells. In addition, 2347 single cells were identified from the sequencing data (~3000 RNA UMI per cell and 7000 RNAPII unique reads per cell, Supplementary Data\u00a0 ). The RNAPII binding and RNA signals from the pooled single cells were compared with ENCODE bulk cell RNAPII ChIP-seq data (Fig.\u00a0 , top three tracks) and ENCODE RNA-seq data from H1 ESC and 293\u2009T cells (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom three panels), respectively. A median of 1900 (0.6 in terms of fraction) useful RNA UMI (i.e., UMI located within gene regions) were detected per single cell. A median of 700 genes were detected per cell (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Also, four metrics were used to quantify the quality of RNAPII signals. A median of 1400 unique reads (0.2 in terms of fraction) were located within the peaks identified using ENCODE data. A median of 900 peaks were detected (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results indicate that scPCOR-seq can simultaneously detect faithfully RNAPII binding and RNA levels at a single-cell resolution. We used a similar strategy to cluster cells based on the RNA-RNAPII co-profiling data (Fig.\u00a0 ). Both the single-cell RNA and RNAPII occupancy data correctly clustered H1 and 293\u2009T cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). Since RNAPII is directly responsible for producing RNAs and RNAPII binding from pooled single cells in H1 and 293\u2009T cells indicates a positive correlation between RNAPII binding and RNA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), we next examined whether cell-to-cell variation in gene expression is correlated with that in RNAPII binding. The data indicate that cell-to-cell variation in gene expression is positively correlated with that in RNAPII binding in both H1 cells and 293\u2009T cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). Importantly, this correlation is cell type specific meaning that the correlation is higher if both gene expression and RNAPII data are from the same cell type.

During the differentiation, the cell surface marker CD36 is significantly upregulated from day 5 and reaches peak expression by day 11, which is accompanied by decreased expression of CD34. We constructed libraries for both H3K4me3 and RNA for CD34+ cells and the cells differentiated for 2, 5, 8, and 11 days. Totally, 13,406 out of 14,167 single cells passed the QC (409 CD34 cells, 871 CD36 Day-2 cells, 7589 Day-5 cells, 3304 Day 8 cells, 1193 Day-11 cells). The H3K4me3 and RNA signals from the pooled single cells (CD36+ 11 days differentiation) were compared with the published bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data (Fig.\u00a0 , the second tracks counted from the top) and with the published bulk cell RNA-seq data from CD36+ cells (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom track). From the genome coverage profile of the RNA-seq data, the reads are more likely to be located in the TSS and TES regions (Fig.\u00a0 ). The enrichment plot of H3K4me3 data (Fig.\u00a0 ) around TSS showed the average fold-enrichment of 2.5. The RNA part of scPCOR-seq showed lower complexity than the published  bulk cell RNA-seq data using preseq  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). To test whether the H3K4me3 signals are dependent on the H3K4me3 antibody, we compared the H3K4me3 signals from scPCOR-seq in CD36+ cells with the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data and ATAC-seq data in CD36+ cells. As shown by the Genome Browser tracks at randomly selected genomic regions, the H3K4me3 data from scPCOR-seq data are more consistent with the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data than the ATAC-seq data (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). For the H3K4me3 data from scPCOR-seq, the average fraction of reads in peaks is ~0.4 while the average fraction of reads in peaks for H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data is ~0.8. For a global comparison between these different datasets, 21,290, 21,311, and 21229 peaks were identified from the bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data, ATAC-seq data, and pooled single-cell H3K4me3 data from scPCOR-seq data, respectively. A comparison of these peaks revealed that while 72% of the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks and 70% of the scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with the ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), 86% of the scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with the bulk cell H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The higher overlap between the H3K4me3 scPCOR-seq peaks with the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks than that between the H3K4me3 scPCOR-seq peaks with the ATAC-seq peaks from both CD36+ and 293T cells (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0  and  ) suggests that the signal of scPCOR-seq is specific to the antibody.

P   value is computed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. \n  \n\nFor the RNA-seq data, the median of the useful UMI increased from CD34+ cells (~300\u2009UMI) to CD36 cells at 11 days (~3000\u2009UMI) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The number of detected genes also increased from CD34+ cells (~200 genes) to CD36+ cells at 11 days (~500 genes) (Fig.\u00a0 ). For the H3K4me3 data, the median of unique reads in peaks decreased from CD34+ cells (~12,000 unique reads) to CD36+ cells at 11 days (~7000 unique reads) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The number of detected peaks also decreased from CD34+ cells (~3000 peaks) to CD36+ cells at 11 days (~1200 peaks) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The different numbers in the metrics among the cells at different differentiation stages are possibly due to the differences in cellular environments (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Next, the batch effects in the single cells were removed by FastMNN  and projected into the reduced space from UMAP (Fig.\u00a0 ). We observed that the CD34+ cells and day 11 CD36+ cells were localized to two clusters that are most distant from each other in the plot with ether RNA or H3K4me3 data, which is consistent with the process of cell differentiation. The clusters of day 8 and day 11 CD36+ cells based on either RNA or H3K4me3 were very close to each other in the plot, indicating a high similarity between them. The day 2 CD36 cells exhibited high levels of heterogeneity in both the RNA and H3K4me3 plots, suggesting that the cells display heterogeneous levels of response to differentiation signals at the early stages of differentiation. Interestingly, the H3K4me3 data of day 5 CD36 cells displayed different patterns of clustering properties as compared to the RNA data. It was apparent that the day 5 CD36 cells based on the H3K4me3 data already exhibited a unique cluster that was localized between the clusters of CD34/CD36 (day 2) and CD36 (day 8 and 11) cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). However, clustering of the day 5 CD36 cells based on the RNA data separated the cells into two distinct clusters: one was localized between the clusters of CD34/CD36 (day 2) and CD36 (day 8 and 11) cells while the other was not separated from the CD34/CD36 (day 2) cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results potentially suggest that the changes in H3K4me3 may occur ahead of the changes in transcription during the differentiation process, implying that H3K4me3 plays a critical role in cell differentiation process which later controls the transcription landscape. Different cell type specific genes were selected (HBB is more specific in CD34 cells while IL1R2 is more specific in CD36 11 days). Their expression level and H3K4me3 density were shown in the UMAP spaces in which the change is also consistent to their cell-type specific roles (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , the cells at CD36 5 days were clustered into two groups using K-means method using the RNA data. The two clusters of cells were named as CD36 5 days-A and CD36 5 days-B (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The cells in CD36 5 days-A are more like CD34 cells and CD36 2 days cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Compared to Day 5\u2009A cells, 341 genes have significant higher expression in Day 5B cells while no genes have lower expression in Day 5B cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). However, the H3K4me3 density at these genes do not show a significant increased H3K4me3 signals from Day 5A to Day 5B cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). This result may support that the changes in H3K4me3 occur ahead of the changes in transcription during the differentiation process. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nElucidating cellular heterogeneity was shown to be important for understanding different biological processes, including cell differentiation and tumor progression etc. However, few studies addressed the question of origins and mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity in gene expression at a single-cell level. Several studies indicated variations in chromatin status may contribute to variations in gene expression, suggesting that both cis regulatory elements and trans acting chromatin binding factors play important roles in the cellular heterogeneity of gene expression. In this study, we developed scPCOR-seq, a method for simultaneously measuring RNA expression levels and chromatin occupancy of chromatin binding proteins or histone modifications in the same single-cell and demonstrated its application to human H1 ESCs, GM12878, and 293T cells. Profiling H3K4me3 and RNA by applying scPCOR-seq to human CD34+ and CD36+ cells revealed that both histone and RNA signals are cell-type specific, and H3K4me3 showed a change prior to the change of RNA in cells at CD36+ 5 days. \n\nOne limitation of the current scPCOR-seq protocol is that the RNA reads have relatively lower complexity and low genome overage rate compared to the bulk cell measurements. Proper clusters could be identified using the RNA part of the human CD36 scPCOR-seq data, but future studies should be careful about the interpretation of the RNA part of scPCOR-seq data. Overall, we conclude that scPCOR-seq will serve as a powerful tool to study the joint profiling of RNA and histone modification marks \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Reagents \n  \nHistone H3 trimethyl Lys4 antibody was purchased from Millipore (catalog no. 07\u2013473), RNAPII antibody was purchased from Abcam (catalog no. ab817).

The reverse transcription is performed as described in  (50\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min; 3 cycles for the following: 8\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009s, 15\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009s, 20\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009s, 30\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009s, 42\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min, 50\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min; 50\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min and hold at 4\u2009\u00b0C). \n\n\n### Exonuclease I (Exo I) digestion \n  \nThe cells were washed twice with rinsing buffer, resuspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl reaction buffer (5\u2009\u03bcl 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009Exo I buffer, 1\u2009\u03bcl Exo I, 44\u2009\u03bcl H O) and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. This is to remove the excess primers left after reverse transcription. After digestion, the cells were washed twice with rinsing buffer to stop the reaction. \n\n\n### Library construction \n  \n96 barcode-P7 adaptors (10\u2009\u03bcM) stored in a 96-well plate were thawed at 4\u2009\u00b0C, then 1\u2009\u03bcl of each was added to the corresponding well in a new 96-well plate with multichannel pipette. Downstream library construction was performed same as the indexing single-cell ChIC-seq protocol . Briefly, the cells were suspended with nuclei suspension buffer and mixed with enzyme dilution buffer, followed by aliquoted into 10\u2009\u03bcl in 96 wells, mixing with the added barcode-P7 adaptors. The plate was sealed completely and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. After incubation, the cells were pooled together in a solution trough containing 500\u2009\u03bcl stop buffer, resuspended with 800\u2009\u03bcl 1\u00d7 PBS and send to flow cytometry core. 30 cells were sorted in each well of a new 96-well plate which contain 13\u2009\u03bcl buffer mixture per well (3\u2009\u03bcl reverse-crosslink buffer, 10\u2009\u03bcl PBS containing 0.1% NP40). The plate was sealed completely and incubated at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 6\u2009h and 80\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. \n\nAfter reverse-crosslink, indexed PCR1 was performed by adding 13\u2009\u03bcl 2\u00d7 Phusion\u00ae High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (New England BioLabs) and 1\u2009\u03bcl 2\u2009\u03bcM index primer with the following condition: 98\u2009\u00b0C 3\u2009min, 12 cycles of 65\u2009\u00b0C 30\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C 30\u2009s, followed by 72\u2009\u00b0C 5\u2009min. Then the libraries were pooled together, digested with Exo I and purified by MinElute\u00ae Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). Downstream A-tailing and P5 adaptor ligation were performed same as the indexing single-cell ChIC-seq protocol . PCR2 amplification with i5 index primer and P7-c2 primer was set in the following condition: 98\u2009\u00b0C 3\u2009min, 57\u2009\u00b0C 3\u2009min, 72\u2009\u00b0C 1\u2009min, 7 cycles of 98\u2009\u00b0C 10\u2009s, 65\u2009\u00b0C 15\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C 30\u2009s, followed by 72\u2009\u00b0C 5\u2009min. The PCR products were run on the 2% E-Gel\u00ae EX Agarose Gel (Invitrogen). The fragments between 250\u2013600 base pair (bp) were isolated and purified by the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The concentration of the library was measured by Qubit dsDNA HS kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq 2500 and Novaseq. \n\n\n### Data from other studies \n  \nENCFF001RDI is for GM12878 RNA-seq. ENCFF843FZA is for H1 cells RNA-seq.

The valid pairs of read will be further separated into either RNA part or DNA part. If the linker sequences \u201cGAGCG\u201d for not-so-random primers or the linker sequences \u201cCCTGCAGG\u201d for oligodT were found in the location within 7\u201311th and 7\u201314th base of read1, the pair of reads were belonged to RNA. The remaining valid pairs were belonged to DNA. Using the information of the cell barcodes located at 5\u2019 of read2, both pairs of reads belonging to RNA and DNA were separated into 96 sets of FASTQ files, respectively. Reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg19 using Bowtie2 Duplicates using different trimming parameters. Finally, the mapping results were combined, and Duplicated reads were removed based on mapping position and UMI for the reads belonging to DNA. \n\n\n### Comparison of peaks \n  \nFor scRNA-scH3K4me3 measurements using cell lines, cells were clustered and identified as 293T, H1, and GM12878 cells. The pseudo-bulk H3K4me3 ChIC-seq data from scRNA-scH3K4me3 measurements were pooled from the 293T cells. Also, we downloaded the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data  (SRR5627135), and ATAC-seq data (SRR5627157) for 293T cells. We used the software SICER to identify the similar number of peaks for each dataset: We identified 10,868 H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, 10,837 scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks and 10,860 ATAC-seq peaks. Peak overlap was computed using BEDTools (bedtools intersect) . \n\nThe pseudo-bulk scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 CD36 11 days data from scRNA-scH3K4me3 measurements were pooled. Also, we downloaded the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data (SRR8358376) for CD36 11 days, and ATAC-seq data (SRR8509522) for CD36 cells 10 days. We used the software SICER to identify the similar number of peaks for each dataset: We identified 21,290 H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, 21,229 scPCOR-seq H3K4me3 peaks from our scPCOR-seq and 21,311 ATAC-seq peaks. Peak overlap was computed using BEDTools (bedtools intersect) . \n\n\n### Filtering for single cells and genes \n  \nFor both scRNA-scRNAPII and scRNA-scH3K4me3 measurements using cell lines, genes and peak regions were excluded if less than 30 have reads in these regions. Single cells that have both at least 1000 RNA reads, and 1000 DNA reads were first considered. For both scRNA-scRNAPII, if single cells have reads in less than 100 peak regions or 100 gene regions, they were excluded. For both scRNA-scH3K4me3, if single cells have reads in less than 450 peak regions or 450 gene regions, they were excluded. \n\nFor scRNA-scH3K4me3 measurements using CD34 and CD36 cells, genes and peak regions were excluded if less than 30 have reads in these regions. If single cells have reads in less than 50 peak regions or 50 gene regions, they were excluded. Totally, 13,406 out of 14,167 single cells passed the QC. \n\n\n### Dimension reduction for cell lines \n  \nFor all scPCOR-seq measurements for cell line, the UMI matrix for RNA and the read count matrix for DNA were computed. The columns of RNA UMI matrix correspond to cells and its rows correspond to the genes. Similarly, the columns of DNA read count matrix correspond to cells and its rows correspond to the peak regions. The UMI matrix was transformed by based two logarithm transformations. The read count matrices were normalized by the library sizes and were transformed by based two logarithm transformations. For both RNA and DNA parts, PCA was applied to the two matrices. UMAP was further applied on the obtained principal component matrix. \n\n\n### Cell clustering \n  \nFor both RNA and DNA parts, cells were clustered for the scPCOR-seq cell line data. First, two cell-to-cell correlation matrices corresponding to RNA and DNA parts were computed using the obtained principal components. The   z   score transformation was applied to these matrices . The edges between two genes/regions with   z   score values smaller than 3.2 were filtered out, resulting in two networks for RNA and DNA. The multiplex network clustering method MolTi  was applied to both RNA and DNA networks. \n\n\n### Removal of batch effect \n  \nscPCOR-seq CD34 and CD36 data were from four batches. The UMI matrix for RNA and the read count matrix for DNA were computed. The columns of RNA UMI matrix correspond to cells and its rows correspond to the genes. Similarly, the columns of DNA read count matrix correspond to cells and its rows correspond to the peak regions. For both RNA and DNA parts, batch effects were removed for the scPCOR-seq CD34 and CD36 data using FastMNN . UMAP was further applied on the reduced matrix outputted by FastMNN . \n\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility \n  \nHypergeometric test was used to calculate the   p   value in Figs.\u00a0 f, g,  , g. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to calculate the   p   value in Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . We jointly profiled scRNA-scPolII using 2000 mixed H1 and 293\u2009T cells and scRNA-scH3K4me3 using 4000 mixed H1 293\u2009T cells, GM12878. We jointly profiled scRNA-scH3K4me3 using a total of 14,167 sorted CD34, CD36 2 days, CD36 5 day, CD36 8 day, and CD36 11day cells. There are no replicates involved in each experiment. However, the three independent scPCOR-seq experiments support the robustness of the method. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9270334, "text_md5": "4ca8b298d6501e19c76e75ecbe965adf", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 77], "journal": [78, 89], "publication_year": [91, 95], "title": [106, 185], "keywords": [199, 224], "abstract": [237, 1903], "body": [1912, 41564]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35804086, "doi": "10.1038/s42003-022-03584-6", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9270334", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9270334"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9270334\">9270334</a>", "list_title": "PMC9270334  scPCOR-seq enables co-profiling of chromatin occupancy and RNAs in single cells"}

Using high- and super-resolution imaging with ovastacin  as a fluorescent marker, we characterize cortical granule dynamics at single granule resolution in transgenic mouse eggs. Newly-developed imaging protocols provide an unprecedented view of vesicular dynamics near the plasma membrane in mouse eggs. We discover that cortical granule anchoring in the cortex is dependent on maternal MATER and document that myosin IIA is required for biphasic trafficking to the plasma membrane. We observe local clearance of cortical actin during exocytosis and determine that pharmacologic or genetic disruption of trafficking to the plasma membrane impairs secretion of cortical granules and results in polyspermy. Thus, the regulation of cortical granule dynamics at the cortex-plasma membrane interface is critical for exocytosis and the post-fertilization block to sperm binding that ensures monospermic fertilization. \n  \nMammalian eggs require a single sperm for viable fertilization, and cortical granule exocytosis prevents additional sperm binding. Vogt et al. image at single granule resolution to document that cortical granule anchoring in the cortex ensures proper trafficking, exocytosis and polyspermy block. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRegulated exocytosis is a fundamental cellular event that releases cargo molecules at the cell surface for specific physiological tasks including neurotransmission, immune response, and reproduction . In mouse eggs, exocytosis of cortical granules (CGs) makes the extracellular zona pellucida impermeable to additional sperm in the post-fertilization block to polyspermy . CGs are derived from the Golgi apparatus and migrate towards the cortex during oogenesis where they accumulate in a uniform layer that is displaced 0.4 to 0.6\u2009\u03bcm inward from the plasma membrane . Anchoring CGs at the periphery is correlated with the acquisition of exocytotic competence, defined as the ability to undergo exocytosis in response to increased intracellular calcium . In mice, the transport of CGs to the cortex is dependent on actin  and the egg cytoplasmic actin network mediates long-range transport of vesicles . A recent study carefully documented two pathways that translocate CGs from the center of the egg to the periphery during meiosis. One depends on myosin Va powered movement along actin filaments and the other relies on CG binding to Rab11a vesicles to hitchhike to the egg cortex. Defects in these pathways lead to polyspermy . \n\nHowever, our current understanding of CG dynamics at the cortex-plasma membrane interface in mouse eggs remains limited. In the absence of protocols to perform live-imaging near the plasma membrane, earlier studies relied on staining fixed CGs with the relatively non-specific LCA (  lens culinaris   agglutinin) lectin. In additional, mouse CGs are ~200\u2009nm which is near the diffraction limit of standard light microcopy . However, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) combined with super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) can overcome these limitations and provide sub-diffractive, live-imaging of fluorescently labeled subcellular organelles . \n\nWe have previously reported a subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) that forms during oogenesis and, when disrupted, delays or abrogates cleavage-stage embryogenesis . Its biological function(s) during oogenesis have been less well investigated and its peripheral location suggests potential involvement in membrane-associated processes including vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. We also have reported on ovastacin, a zinc metalloendopeptidase that was identified as a pioneer marker of mammalian CGs. It is released during exocytosis and cleaves ZP2 in the extracellular zona pellucida to prevent sperm binding which provides a potent post-fertilization block to polyspermy . \n\nHere, we seek to gain insight into CG biology using multiple live-cell imaging modalities with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution and transgenic mice expressing fluorescently tagged ovastacin  as a marker of CGs. We genetically document the involvement of the SCMC component MATER in anchoring CGs at the egg cortex and demonstrate a role for myosin IIA in CG trafficking and clearance of cortical actin prior to exocytosis. Perturbation of CG trafficking at the cortex-plasma membrane interface leads to polyspermy and adversely affects in vivo female fertility. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Mouse CGs accumulate in the egg cortex \n  \nTo perform live-diffraction limited and super-resolution (instant TIRF-SIM) imaging of the cortical cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, the 8\u2009\u03bcm thick zona pellucida was removed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Live confocal microscopy of stimulated wild-type eggs in the presence of plasma membrane (CellMask) and actin-binding fluorogenic (SiR-actin) dyes documented an uneven plasma membrane topography and enrichment of filamentous actin (F-actin, referred to as actin hereafter) as a cytoskeletal scaffold. Single XZ optical sections spanning the membrane clusters showed individual microvilli-like structures and actin fibers that extended in the axial direction. 3D recordings further documented dynamic disappearance and reappearance of actin in a single lateral plane (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nCGs initially were detected by confocal microscopy in fixed eggs from transgenic mice expressing ovastacin  (  Astl  ) using fluorescently tagged   lens culinaris   agglutinin (LCA) or ovastacin  (Fig.\u00a0 ). To determine whether CGs were enriched in the cortex prior to exocytosis, we imaged zona-free   Astl   eggs at single granule resolution. Live confocal microscopy showed accumulation of CGs in the egg cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). Surprisingly, 3D confocal recordings that sampled the cortex of zona-free eggs every 5\u2009s (Fig.\u00a0 , inset; Supplementary Movies\u00a0 ,  ) revealed that CGs not only co-localized and moved along actin (Fig.\u00a0 , C2), but actin also polymerized and extended into the imaging plane towards a single CG (Fig.\u00a0 , C1; arrowhead). Following attachment, actin retracted and pulled the CG towards an area, which accumulated a new membrane microdomain (Fig.\u00a0 , C1; dashed area). This contrasted with a stationary CG (Fig.\u00a0 , C1; arrow) which appeared near the membrane at the onset of imaging. The proportion of CGs that associated with actin was higher than those without contact suggesting that CGs interact with the cortical actin scaffold for movement (Fig.\u00a0 ). The co-localization and associated movement with cortical actin also were confirmed in fixed samples using super-resolution instant structured illumination microscopy iSIM (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nCortical granules in the mouse egg.   a   Confocal cross-sections of z-projections of individual and merged channels of ovastacin  eggs (red) fixed and stained with LCA-FITC (green).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nTo follow dynamic movement of granules deeper into the cytoplasm of stimulated mouse eggs, we performed rapid 4D iSIM imaging . iSIM projections showed enrichment of CGs beneath the plasma membrane (Fig.\u00a0 , inset; Supplementary Movie\u00a0 ) and individual CGs could be resolved as they approached the plasma membrane (Fig.\u00a0 ; circle in lower panels). Detailed analysis of vesicle movement documented more CGs in the cortex where they also resided for a longer time than CGs present deeper in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results indicate that mouse CGs interact with a dynamic actin cytoskeleton in the egg cortex prior to exocytosis. \n\n\n### MATER anchors CGs in the egg cortex \n  \nWe used   Astl   female mice and antibodies to MATER (official gene name,   Nrlp5  ) to confirm the peripheral location of the SCMC and CGs in fully grown oocytes and ovulated eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ). We then established   Mater  ;   Astl   mice in which CGs did not preferentially accumulate in the cortex of eggs but were scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a0 ). This striking redistribution was quantified by live confocal microscopy of stimulated eggs with >2-fold increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity of mCherry-labeled CGs in the   Mater   background (Fig.\u00a0 ). Similar observations were obtained with super-resolution iSIM on fixed samples that documented a >4-fold decrease in the number of CGs in the cortex of   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ). These findings were confirmed by electron microscopy in which CGs were nearly absent in the cortex, but present in the cytoplasm of   Mater   eggs, whereas the opposite distribution was observed in wild-type eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ). Thus, anchoring CGs in the egg cortex requires the presence of maternal MATER.   \nMATER anchors cortical granules in the cortex of mouse eggs.   a   Full-grown, zona-intact oocytes (upper) and ovulated eggs (lower) were collected from ovastacin  (red) transgenic mice, fixed and stained with anti-MATER antibodies (magenta) and LCA-FITC (green) to visualize cortical granules.

The imaging rate was sufficient to track the movement and identification of three fluorescent subpopulations based on the duration of their tracks (Fig.\u00a0 ). We noted a strong bimodal distribution in   Mater   eggs with one peak representing short tracks (<8\u2009s) and another peak for long tracks, in which granules were already present at the starting frame and still observed at the last frame of the experiment (49\u2009s). We classified the duration of the tracks between the two peaks as medium. Although short-, medium-, and long-duration granules were present in   Mater   eggs, the absolute number of CGs (total: 1511) at the plasma membrane was lower (Fig.\u00a0 ). This was anticipated based on our earlier observation that the number of granules anchored to the cortex was reduced in   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nBiphasic cortical granule trafficking to the plasma membrane.   a   Live, instant TIRF-SIM imaging of cortical granules during exocytosis at the plasma membrane. Zona-free   Mater   (left) and   Mater   (right) eggs expressing ovastacin  (red) were stimulated to exocytose and imaged in the presence of the membrane dye CellMask (green) at 1\u2009s intervals (\u00d750) (see corresponding Supplementary Movies\u00a0 , ).

Y  -axis reflects the start time of an individual track in the 49\u2009s imaging period. A large proportion of long tracks persistent over the entire observation period from 0 to 49\u2009s (yellow hexbin, lower right). Green hexbins vertically represent short tracks that appear and disappear throughout the observation period. Hexbins along the bottom and diagonally represent longer tracks that start or stop within the observation window.   e   Violin plots show fluorescent intensities (arbitrary units) of short-, medium-, and long-duration tracks averaged over the length of each track in stimulated   Mater   (left) and   Mater   (right) eggs. The plot boundary captures all data points with the width reflecting the relative kernel density. Within the plot center, the thin and thick gray lines indicate 95% confidence and interquartile range, respectively.   f   Representative examples of enlarged single frames from live instant TIRF-SIM showing single cortical granules classified as appearing, neither, and vanishing together with corresponding intensity plots to the right.   g   Stacked column charts show the percentage of long-duration tracks\u00a0classified as appearing, neither, or vanishing, based on the intensity profile plot, in stimulated   Mater   (  n  \u2009=\u2009402) and   Mater   eggs (  n  \u2009=\u2009325) \n  \n\nOur particle tracking analysis uncovered specific differences in the three subpopulations. As a percentage,   Mater   eggs not only contained more short and long tracks (Fig.\u00a0 ; chi-squared test,   p  \u2009<\u20092.2e ), but they were also substantially depleted in tracks of medium duration when visualized using a hexbin density plot (Fig.\u00a0 , diagonal and bottom middle of plots). In addition, short-duration granules moved faster than their medium- or long-duration counterparts in the absence of MATER (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We further interrogated the mean fluorescent track intensities across the three subpopulations and did not observe significant differences in the track intensities of short-, medium-, and long-duration granules in   Mater   eggs. Notably, track intensities were substantially higher in all three populations in stimulated   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Whereas the absence of MATER does not appear to affect trafficking to the plasma membrane from any subpopulation, our data indicates that the interaction of granules with the plasma membrane and the subsequent release of ovastacin is impaired. \n\nNext, we analyzed the track intensity of only long-duration granules. We identified individual appearing granules in   Mater   eggs that moved into focus at the plasma membrane and became brighter (Fig.\u00a0 ) suggesting that sustained secretion requires arrival of new vesicles at the plasma membrane, which are rendered fusion-competent . Strikingly, appearing vesicles were nearly absent in   Mater   eggs indicating that recruitment of new granules to the membrane was impaired (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We also identified vanishing granules, where the fluorescent intensity decayed (Fig.\u00a0 ). Since instant TIRF-SIM does not indicate directionality, we cannot determine whether the disappearance of granule fluorescence was due to exocytosis or retreat into the cell interior. However, having established that the track intensity of long-duration granules was significantly higher in   Mater   eggs due to impaired interactions at the plasma membrane, we favor the model that most of the vanishing granules are undergoing exocytosis and noted fewer vanishing granules in   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These differences suggest that exocytosis could be delayed in the absence of MATER. \n\nWe also clustered tracks into a third category, which neither conformed to appearing nor vanishing profiles. This neither category contained a range of intensity profiles (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), but the fluorescent intensity remained roughly constant or varied enough that no clear pattern was observed (Fig.\u00a0 ). Interestingly, this category of granules was predominantly observed in   Mater   eggs suggesting that it could further contribute to a delay in exocytosis. Thus, particle tracking at high spatiotemporal resolution with instant TIRF-SIM in combination with computational analysis showed that anchoring CGs critically affects their trafficking from the cortex to the plasma membrane in mouse eggs. \n\n\n### Non-muscle myosin IIA associates with CGs \n  \nWe determined that fluorescent myoIIA in transgenic mice  was present in the cortex of fixed, phalloidin-stained fully-grown oocytes and stimulated eggs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). To investigate the possibility that myoIIA was recruited onto CGs, we generated mice carrying both the fluorescent reporter knock-in   MyoIIA   and   Astl   transgenes. Acquiring TIRF images every 5\u2009s over 5\u2009min was sufficient to follow CGs for an extended period (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Movie\u00a0 ). Intriguingly, myoIIA  associated with two populations of granules: appearing and stationary. As previously documented with instant TIRF-SIM, we noted appearing granules moving into the TIRF field over time and becoming brighter. In contrast, the brightness did not change in stationary granules, which were present from the first to the last frame of the experiment (Fig.\u00a0 ). Tracking the motion of 5496 CGs and plotting their bimodal distribution over the 5-min imaging period showed that 1033 (~20%) were stationary (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nNon-muscle myosin IIA associates with mouse cortical granules.   a   Eggs expressing transgenic ovastacin  and knock-in myoIIA  were sampled every 10\u2009s for 5\u2009min in the presence of the fluorogenic probe SiR-actin for F-actin at the plasma membrane using diffraction-limited TIRFM (see corresponding Supplementary Movie\u00a0 ).

Scale bar, 5\u2009\u03bcm.   f   Profile plot of dashed line in magnified   e   (inset of right panel) indicating peaks in mCherry (cortical granules) and EGFP channel of myoIIA \n  \n\nConfocal sections of fixed eggs not only showed accumulation of myoIIA  and ovastacin  in the cortex, but also diffraction-limited puncta of EGFP-labeled myoIIA, some of which appeared near ovastacin -labeled CGs (Fig.\u00a0 ; inset; arrows). To spatially resolve the two signals, we turned to super-resolution iSIM. Notably, myoIIA  diffusively localized around EGFP-void areas 15\u2009min post stimulation (Fig.\u00a0 ; dashed area). However, we also observed a preferential enrichment of myoIIA  as a set of puncta (Fig.\u00a0 ; arrows). The spatial resolution of iSIM indicated that only single punctum marking EGPF-labeled myoIIA co-localized with mCherry-labeled CGs (Fig.\u00a0 ). The data must be interpreted cautiously, however, because at iSIM resolution, a single punctum could contain more than one molecule. Interestingly, we also detected the presence of CGs inside EGFP-void areas (Fig.\u00a0 ; XZ plane; arrowhead). As the motor domain in the head portion of the myoIIA molecule contains a well-characterized actin-binding site , we reasoned that myoIIA  puncta were recruited to newly assembled actin. Immunostaining of myoIIA  expressing eggs with phalloidin confirmed that single myoIIA  puncta overlapped with actin-rich foci (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Altogether, these results suggest that non-muscle myoIIA associates with mouse CGs trafficking to the plasma membrane for exocytosis. \n\n\n### Clearance of cortical actin prior to exocytosis \n  \nCortical actin presents a barrier that cells must first clear before subcellular vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane . To determine whether myoIIA -void areas correlated with the clearance of cortical actin, we analyzed fixed, ovastacin  eggs\u00a0after stimulation for 5 or 15\u2009min using iSIM. Whereas a mostly dense cortical actin scaffold was present after 5\u2009min of stimulation (Fig.\u00a0 ), we observed prominent actin-free areas after 15\u2009min (Fig.\u00a0 ; inset, dashed area). Consistent with the presence of CGs in myoIIA -void areas (Fig.\u00a0 ), we also detected CGs inside actin-free areas (Fig.\u00a0 ; inset, arrows) suggesting that local clearance of the cortical actomyosin network could provide access of CGs to the plasma membrane for exocytosis (Fig.\u00a0 ; schematic). In contrast, a diffuse and dense cortical actin meshwork persisted in   Mater   eggs even after 15\u2009min of stimulation indicating that the absence of MATER not only impairs CG anchoring at the egg cortex, but also cortical actin turnover associated with exocytosis in mouse eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nClearance of egg cortex during cortical granule exocytosis.   a   Zona-free ovastacin  eggs were stimulated to exocytose and fixed after 5 and 15\u2009min followed by immunostaining with phalloidin to label F-actin.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nWe hypothesized that myoIIA mediated contraction leads to actin clearance. Intrigued, however, by our earlier observation that actin clearance was impaired in the absence of MATER, we first performed immunoblot analysis in unstimulated wild-type and   Mater   eggs using an isoform-specific myoIIA antibody. Strikingly, immunoblots detected intact myoIIA protein in wildtype, but only small amounts in   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ). Myosin V, implicated in CG trafficking , was also decreased in   Mater   eggs indicating that more than one class of myosins is affected in the absence of MATER. To rule out the possibility that low protein expression levels in mutant eggs masked the detection of sub-diffractive myoIIA, we also imaged the cortex using iSIM and observed myoIIA puncta in stimulated   Mater   eggs (Fig.\u00a0 ) indicating the presence of myoIIA, albeit at low levels. \n\nBlebbistatin inhibits myoIIA motor ATPase activity, the small molecule inhibitor ML-7 targets the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which is responsible for regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation and myoIIA filament assembly . In contrast, actin dynamics are largely driven by Arp2/3- and formin-dependent actin nucleation, which are inhibited by CK666 and SMIFH2, respectively, and myoIIA-dependent contractile forces . Stimulation of zona-free eggs in the presence of myoIIA and actin inhibitors for 15\u2009min led to repression of actin clearance (Fig.\u00a0 ). Together, these results argue that cortical actin is locally cleared in mouse eggs prior to exocytosis. This process is not only dependent on maternal MATER, but also on myoIIA activity and initial actin nucleation. \n\n\n### Impaired trafficking delays exocytosis and causes polyspermy \n  \nTo determine the biological significance of impaired CG trafficking and actin clearance for the zona pellucida block to polyspermy, we performed in vitro fertilization of   Mater   and wild-type eggs. We noticed significantly more sperm in the perivitelline space of two-cell embryos (Fig.\u00a0 ; 5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u2009s.e.m.; Student\u2019s   t  -test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) after fertilization of eggs from   Mater   females indicating a decrease in the zona block to penetration. This deprecation of the post-fertilization zona block was also observed in vivo (Fig.\u00a0 ) where more than 60% of fertilized zygotes collected from   Mater   females had one or more sperm in the perivitelline space (Fig.\u00a0 ; arrows; 1.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009s.e.m.; chi-squared test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The increased frequency of additional sperm in the perivitelline space was also detected in two-cell embryos derived from   Mater   females (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nImpaired trafficking leads to delayed exocytosis and polyspermy.   a   Ovulated eggs from wild-type (left) and   Mater   (right) female mice were inseminated, cultured to two-cell embryos and stained with WGA-Alexa Fluor 633 lectin (red, zona pellucida) and Hoechst 33342 (blue, DNA).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nMore striking, the number of zygotes with three pronuclei collected from   Mater   females after in vivo mating increased to 15%. Consequently, one of the blastomeres in two-cell embryos from   Mater   females contained two nuclei instead of one (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). To follow the kinetics of CG exocytosis, we acquired confocal z-stacks of stimulated live whole mount eggs expressing ovastacin  at 10-min intervals. The intensity of ovastacin  fluorescence in the cortex of eggs heterozygous for the   Mater   null allele declined sharply 10\u201320\u2009min after stimulation. In contrast, in eggs homozygous of the   Mater   null allele, there was an increase in cortical fluorescence 60\u2009min after stimulation, presumably due to the continued translocation of CGs from the interior to the periphery of the egg (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Movies\u00a0 ,  ). The delayed CG exocytosis in   Mater   eggs significantly affected ZP2 cleavage which remained intact 30\u2009min after stimulation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  for uncropped images), thus allowing additional sperm to bind and penetrate the zona matrix. A similar effect on the post-fertilization block to polyspermy was not observed in the absence of FLOPED (official gene name,   Ooep  ) another component of the SCMC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nDue to maternally imposed embryonic lethality that precludes progression beyond 2\u20134 cell,   Mater   mice are infertile in vivo.  To determine the effect of myoIIA on in vivo fertility,   MyoIIA   and egg-specific   (Tg)Zp3-Cre   mice were crossed to establish a mouse line (  MyoIIA  ) with an egg-specific (maternal) conditional deletion of the gene (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These female mice had smaller litters (3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7) compared to   MyoIIA   female mice (7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4). After in vitro fertilization, significantly more sperm were observed in the perivitelline space of embryos derived from   MyoIIA   females (Fig.\u00a0 ; arrows; 4.27\u2009\u00b1\u20091.34\u2009s.e.m.; chi-squared test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) indicating a decrease in the zona block to penetration which could account for the lower fertility of   MyoIIA   mice. Taken together, these results document that MATER, a component of the SCMC, and non-muscle myosin IIA participates in CG trafficking and timely exocytosis to prevent polyspermy in mouse eggs. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThree post-fertilization blocks to gamete interaction have evolved in mammals to prevent polyspermy that is embryonic lethal. In mice, the first two occur rapidly after fertilization and prevent additional sperm from fusing with the egg plasma membrane or penetrating the surrounding extracellular zona pellucida . The third and definitive block prevents sperm from even binding to the surface of the zona matrix and depends on egg CG exocytosis and the resultant cleavage of ZP2. Using diffraction-limited and super-resolution imaging of individual CGs fluorescently stained with ovastacin  in transgenic mice, we have investigated CG dynamics at the cortex-plasma membrane interface that prevents polyspermy in mouse eggs. Our data support a model in which MATER is present in the cortex underlying the egg\u2019s plasma membrane where it anchors CGs which are associated with non-muscle myosin IIA. During fertilization and egg activation, cortical actin is cleared and myoIIA is required for CGs to traffic to the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nModel of cortical granule dynamics at the cortex-plasma membrane interface to prevent polyspermy in mouse eggs. MATER anchors cortical granules in the cortex underlying the egg\u2019s plasma membrane where they associate with non-muscle myosin IIA, a motor protein. During fertilization and egg activation, cortical actin is cleared and cortical granules traffic to the plasma membrane. Fusion of cortical granules at the plasma membrane releases their contents, including zinc and the metalloendopeptidase ovastacin, into the extracellular space. These cortical granule contents prevent sperm penetration of the zona matrix and cleave the zona pellucida protein ZP2 to ensure monospermic fertilization \n  \n\nThe SCMC is formed in the subcortex of oocytes during oogenesis and is composed of at least five components including MATER and FLOPED . While investigating a possible role in CG biology, we determined that MATER was required to position CGs in the periphery near the egg plasma membrane. The SCMC is symmetrically present in MII eggs  including a CG free region that is established by an actin cap . Curiously, although MATER is not present in the subcortex in the absence of FLOPED , we did not observe displacement of CGs in eggs derived from homozygous   Floped   female mice. Like the other SCMC members, MATER has motifs associated with protein-protein interaction, specifically 13 leucine-rich repeats  near its carboxyl terminus. Whether cortical anchoring of CGs by MATER is facilitated by direct or indirect interaction(s) with proteins present on the vesicular membrane is currently not known. However, MATER appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, for positioning CGs in the subcortex of mouse eggs. \n\nIn the present study, we document a dense actin meshwork underlying the egg plasma membrane where CGs are anchored. Pharmacological disruption of cortical actin in mouse eggs results in an increased appearance of granules near the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis which supports a model whereby cortical actin acts as a barrier to granule docking. A similar model has been proposed for bi-phasic insulin-granule exocytosis  in which F-actin is organized as a dense web beneath the plasma membrane to impede access of insulin-containing granules to the cell surface . The first rapid phase involves membrane fusion of a limited pool of release-ready insulin granules already present at the plasma membrane . Insulin granules that are deeper within the cell and trafficked to the cell periphery during the second phase secretion slowly replenish this pool , similar to what is observed with CGs. In our model, long-duration vesicles, which are tethered to the plasma membrane, could be required for a slow and sustained release of cargo molecules, whereas short-duration vesicles likely interact transiently with the plasma membrane for a more rapid release as cortical actin is cleared. \n\nWhereas biphasic trafficking is not affected in the absence of MATER, the interaction of long-duration granules is significantly impaired. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected role for CGs of medium-duration. The strong decrease of medium-duration granules and the delay in exocytosis in   Mater   eggs suggests that this subpopulation of CGs is directly or indirectly required for one or more steps of secretion in mouse eggs, either by priming long-duration vesicles for the second phase of secretion by an unknown mechanism or coordinating timely clearance of cortical actin as well as trafficking of short-duration vesicles to the plasma membrane. \n\nAlternatively, one or two myosin II isoforms could generate pulsatile contractile forces on the cortex, which would drive clearance of cortical actin during exocytosis . Our finding that clearance of cortical actin is repressed in the presence of myosin inhibitors supports the concept that ATPase activity and activation of myoIIA are required to disassemble cortical actin. We provide genetic evidence in   Mater   eggs on the importance of myoIIA expression for actin clearance during exocytosis observing strongly reduced myoIIA levels, which could also impair pulsatile contractile forces. In addition to myosin II, myosin V was also reduced in   Mater   eggs. Importantly, myosin V has been demonstrated to associate with insulin-containing granules and CGs , illustrating the requirement of the myosin motors behind granule movement to the cell periphery and secretion. \n\nUnlike other secretory organelles, CGs are not renewed or maintained in the cytoplasm once released at the plasma membrane. Even though instant TIRF-SIM does not indicate directionality, the disappearance of single granule fluorescence appears to be an example of exocytosis rather their retreat into the cell interior and rejoining of the cytoplasmic pool. This conclusion is furthermore supported in   Mater   eggs in which exocytosis is delayed containing fewer disappearing, vanishing granules. \n\nAfter fertilization, CGs release ovastacin, a metalloendopeptidase that cleaves ZP2 and precludes subsequent sperm binding to the zona pellucida . As post-fertilization cleavage of ZP2 proceeds with slow kinetics (10\u201320\u2009min) after in vitro stimulation, the coordination of actin clearance and exocytosis appears to be well adapted to the small size of mouse CGs and the regulated release of their contents. In the absence of MATER, supernumerary sperm accumulate in the perivitelline space between the egg plasma membrane and the inner aspect of the extracellular zona pellucida matrix. This is associated with delayed release of ovastacin and cleavage of ZP2, and is in accord with earlier studies in which genetic ablation of ovastacin prevents the normal post-fertilization block to sperm binding and penetration of the zona matrix . The molecular basis of the post-fertilization block to gamete fusion remains indeterminate, but is reported to be independent of CG exocytosis  and can be bypassed by intracellular sperm injection . The relatively low level of polyspermy that we observe in   Mater   (15%) is more striking in   MyoIIA   eggs which raises the possibility that the trafficking of CGs to the plasma membrane plays a role, either directly or indirectly, in the membrane block to gamete fusion. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Ethical compliance and source of reagents \n  \nMice were maintained in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health under a Division of Intramural Research, NIDDK-approved animal study protocol. Unless otherwise noted, chemical and other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. See Supplementary Table\u00a0  for parameters of imaging experiments. \n\n\n### Mice and genotyping \n  \n Mater   ( ) and   Floped   ( ) mice expressing ovastacin  were generated by crossing the KO lines to transgenic   Astl   mice . Transgenic   Astl   mice were also crossed to mice expressing EGFP-tagged non-muscle myosin IIA (  MyoIIA  ) . Conditional   MyosinIIA   (  MyoIIA  ) mice were generated by crossing homozygous female   MyosinIIA   mice to homozygous floxed males positive for   Tg   (  Zp3-Cre  ) . For genotyping, tail tips of mice were lysed, and DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen). EmeraldAmp GT CR Master Mix (Takara Bio USA) and gene specific primers (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ) were used to amplify specific DNA fragments. PCR was performed with annealing temperatures of 58\u2009\u00b0C and 30 cycles (for   Ovastacin  ), 58\u2009\u00b0C and 28 cycles (for   Mater  ), 55\u2009\u00b0C and 30 cycles (for   Floped  ), 58\u2009\u00b0C and 40 cycles (for   MyosinIIA  ), 60\u2009\u00b0C and 30 cycles (for   Cd9  ), 58\u2009\u00b0C and 35 cycles (for   MyosinIIA  ), 51.7\u2009\u00b0C and 35 cycles (for   Zp3-Cre  ). \n\n\n### Preparation of eggs and embryos for microscopy \n  \nEggs and embryos were collected from oviducts of 8\u201312 week-old females that had been induced to ovulate with 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) followed by 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 48\u2009h later . Eggs were collected approximately 16\u2009h after administration of hCG, placed in EmbryoMax M2 medium containing hyaluronidase (Millipore) until cumulus cells dispersed. For all experiments involving imaging of zona-free eggs, the zona pellucida was removed by rapid (~30\u2009s) treatment with EmbryoMax Tyrode\u2019s solution (Millipore). To induce exocytosis, eggs were parthenogenetically activated in CaCl -free M16 medium supplemented with 5\u2009mM SrCl  at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO . In all experiments involving cytoskeletal inhibitors, zona-free eggs were parthenogenetically activated for 15\u2009min in the presence of 100\u2009\u00b5M blebbistatin (EMD Millipore), 40\u2009\u00b5M ML-7, 100\u2009\u00b5M CK666, 10\u2009\u00b5M SMIFH2 or DMSO as a control. \n\nFor in vitro fertilization, eggs were incubated in human tubal fluid medium (Zenith Biotech) for 6\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C with fresh motile sperm (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u2009ml ) which had been capacitated for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Zygotes and two-cell embryos were also obtained from females hormonally induced to ovulate followed by in vivo mating with males proven to be fertile. The presence of a copulation plug on the following day was used to confirm successful mating. Pronuclear-staged zygotes and two-cell embryos were isolated from oviducts and collected in M2 medium . \n\n\n### Antibodies and immunofluorescence \n  \nZona-intact eggs and early embryos were fixed for 20\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 100\u2009mM PIPES (pH 6.9), 5\u2009mM MgCl , 2\u2009mM EGTA (pH 6.9), 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5 % Triton X-100, and 50% deuterium oxide. Zona-free eggs were fixed as described, but Triton X-100 was omitted. Following fixation, eggs/embryos were washed in PBS containing 3\u2009mg\u2009ml  polyvinylpyrolidone (PBS/PVP), permeabilized for 30\u2009min in PBS/PVP containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 and 2% donkey serum) prior to immunofluorescence . Eggs/embryos were incubated with primary antibodies to MATER  (1:500) and FLOPED  (1:200) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, washed with blocking buffer (three times, 10\u2009min each), and incubated (60\u2009min) with secondary antibody (1:100) followed by staining DNA with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against non-muscle myosin IIA (kindly provided by Dr. Robert Adelstein, NHLBI, NIH) was used at 1:100 dilution. CGs were immunostained with the conjugated lectin LCA-FITC (Cosmo Bio USA) at a 1:100 dilution. \n\n\n### Fixed and live confocal microscopy \n  \nImages were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with a Stable Z heating system (Bioptechs) and a 40x C-Apochromat 1.2 NA water-immersion objective lens. For live imaging, zona-free eggs were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated Bioptechs Delta-T culture dishes with pre-warmed M2 or CaCl  -free M16 medium at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO . Typically, cells were first imaged by taking 6\u20138\u2009\u03bcm   z  -stacks with 0.2\u2009\u03bcm axial steps near the coverslip followed by time lapse acquisition in a single focal plane close to the coverslip every 5\u2009s for up to 5\u2009min. Images were then deconvolved using Huygens Essential Software version 4.0 (Scientific Volume Imaging). A theoretical point-spread function was based on microscope parameters, model confocal parameters established by Huygens and the Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm was used to restore images. Sampling intervals were set manually to the actual experimental values, together with refractive indices and excitation/emission wavelengths. \n\n\n### Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) \n  \nFor TIRF imaging of CGs, zona-free eggs were mounted as described for confocal microscopy. Oocytes were excited using a 100\u2009mW 488-nm laser introduced at the appropriate incident angle through the TIRF-slider (Zeiss) and \u00d763 objective (Zeiss, 1.46 NA Oil, alpha Plan-Apochromat). Images were acquired with a digital Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) controlled with Zeiss Zen 2 software. The size of each pixel was 254\u2009\u00d7\u2009254\u2009nm. To observe CG motion ~250\u2009nm near the plasma membrane in mouse eggs, cells were imaged every 10\u2009s for 5\u2009min. Images were taken with an exposure time of 200\u2009ms using 4% maximal laser output. Under these experimental conditions, no reduction in fluorescence from photobleaching was observed. \n\n\n### Instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM) \n  \nImages were acquired with a VT-iSIM Multi-Point Super Resolution Imaging System (VisiTech International) connected to an Olympus microscope body via a regular c-mount that housed objectives (Olympus UPLSAPO 60XS, 1.3 NA Silicone Oil, for live and fixed sample imaging, or 100\u2009\u00d7\u20091.49 NA Oil objective, for fixed zona-free mouse eggs), an automated XY stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation) and a custom-built heating System to maintain 37\u2009\u00b0C for live-imaging experiments. The imaging pixel size for the \u00d760 and \u00d7100 objective was 107\u2009nm and 64\u2009nm, respectively. For excitation, 488\u2009nm, 561\u2009nm and 642\u2009nm lasers were used. Lasers were combined with an automated 3-position dichroic changer. For live-imaging, zona-free eggs were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated 35\u2009mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corporation). Image acquisition was controlled with Meta-Morph software. Images were acquired with an exposure time of 250\u2009ms using 25\u201340% maximal laser output. The illumination intensity at the back aperture was measured at 1.23\u2009mW, 0.42\u2009mW and 0.26\u2009mW for 488\u2009nm, 561, nm and 642\u2009nm excitation, respectively.   Z  -stacks were captured with 0.2\u2009\u03bcm axial steps (30\u201335 z-sections) for live samples and 0.1\u2009\u03bcm axial steps (80\u201390 z-sections) for fixed samples. Images were subjected to GPU deconvolution  using an ImageJ plugin with a calculated point spread function, destriping and background-subtraction (Microvolution LLC). Although 3D imaging techniques including confocal microscopy subject the mouse eggs to more dose than do TIRF techniques, we did not observe substantial bleaching or phototoxicity in our live experiments, suggesting that these factors did not influence our study. In addition, brightfield inspection of the morphology did not suggest any light-induced effects. \n\n\n### Live instant TIRF-SIM \n  \nInstant TIRF-SIM experiments were conducted on a laboratory assembled instant SIM  that had been modified to provide TIRF illumination . Briefly, the main changes to the original instant SIM were: (1) placement of an annular mask in an upstream plane conjugated to the back focal plane of the objective, thereby removing low-angle, subcritical illumination and ensuring TIRF; and (2) using an ultrahigh numerical aperture (NA) objective lens (Olympus, APON100xHOTTIRF, 1.7 NA) with matched, high-index coverslips (Olympus, 9-U992) to facilitate TIRF. The imaging pixel size was 33.4\u2009nm. 488- and 561-nm lasers were used for illumination, and either notch (Semrock, NF03-488E-25 and NF03-561E-25 notch filters for imaging green and red emission) or bandpass (Semrock, FF03-525 525/50, for imaging green emission) filters were employed to filter fluorescence. Zona-free eggs were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated high-index coverslips and imaged within the evanescent penetration depth of ~120\u2009nm. Exposure times were typically 40\u201350\u2009ms. Illumination laser power before the objective was measured at 1.0\u2009mW, implying an average intensity (given the 58\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200952\u2009\u00b5m field of view) of ~33\u2009W/cm . Temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C using an incubation chamber (Warner Instruments, H301-MINI). The raw images acquired by instant TIRF-SIM were post-processed, including background subtraction and deconvolution, to achieve the full twofold resolution gain relative to conventional widefield fluorescence imaging. Background was usually estimated by averaging 100 images acquired without illumination. For deconvolution, we used the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with an experimental point spread function derived by registering and then averaging twenty 100\u2009nm yellow-green beads. Deconvolution was implemented in MATLAB 2017a (Mathworks). The number of iterations was set to 10 for all images. \n\nTo validate these protocols, we imaged zona-free eggs from   Cd9   female mice. CD9 is a tetraspanin protein that localizes to microvilli of membranes  and   Cd9   eggs have an altered membrane due to varied length, thickness and density of their microvilli . Projected confocal images detected a >1.5-fold reduction in the fluorescent intensity of   Cd9   compared to wild-type eggs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). This observation suggests an altered cell surface that adversely affects the uptake of membrane dye and was confirmed at higher spatial resolution using instant TIRF-SIM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Live-cell F-actin and plasma membrane labeling \n  \nF-actin was labeled with 1\u2009\u03bcM of the live-cell Spirochrome probe SiR-actin (Cytoskeleton) which is based on natural actin-binding jasplakinolide. The plasma membrane was labeled with CellMask Green using the manufacturer\u2019s recommended 1x working solution (ThermoFischer Scientific). Zona-free eggs were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips) with pre-warmed M2 or CaCl  -free M16 medium supplemented with SiR-actin, CellMask Green and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO  for 30\u2009min prior to imaging. Neither CG exocytosis or fertilization was inhibited under these experimental conditions even with 5\u2009\u03bcm SiR-actin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Electron microscopy \n  \nSuper-ovulated eggs from wild-type and   Mater   females were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. After extensive washing in PBS buffer, the eggs were embedded in 2% agarose. The samples were then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions and processed for embedding in LR-White resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained with an ultramicrotome (Microm International GmbH) and mounted on formvar coated nickel grids. For lectin-cytochemistry, grids were incubated with WGA-HRP as previously described . Ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate and imaged in a Phillips Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope. The percentage of WGA-positive CGs was calculated over twelve ultrathin sections of five eggs from wild-type and   Mater   females. Image analysis was performed using Software Mip4 Advanced (Microm Image Processing Software, Digital Image Systems). \n\n\n### Immunoblot \n  \nEggs were lysed in 4x Tris-glycine SDS loading buffer with DTT, separated on 8, 10, and 4\u201312% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were incubated (20\u2009min, RT) in blocking reagent Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque), washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated (4\u2009\u00b0C, overnight) with primary antibodies against non-muscle myosin IIA (1:1000), myosin V (1:1000, kindly provided by John Hammer III, NHLBI, NIH) and \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat # sc-8035). The membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated (1\u2009h, RT) with goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG-HRP secondary antibodies, washed with TBST and developed using Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare). Uncropped images of immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### In vitro cleavage assay \n  \nThe post-fertilization cleavage of ZP2 (120\u2009kD) results in two fragments (30 and 90\u2009kD) rendering the zona matrix unreceptive to sperm binding. Ovulated and parthenogenetically activated eggs as well as two-cell embryos with intact zonae pellucidae from wildtype,   Mater  , and   Floped   mice were resolved by SDS-PAGE and cleavage was analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody m2c.2 to the C-terminus of mouse ZP2 . After stripping membranes with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the membranes were reprobed with \u03b1-MATER (1:1000), \u03b1-FLOPED (1:1000) or \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000) antibody. Uncropped images of immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nLine profiles were generated in Fiji  and measurements were exported to Excel for visualization. Kymographs analyzing the fluorescent signal over time were prepared using the Multi Kymograph tool in Fiji. To detect and measure cortical actin clearances, deconvolved images were imported to Fiji and normalized using the percentile threshold with \u201cdark background\u201d unchecked. Clearances were detected using the analyze particle function with a clearance area of 1\u201340\u2009\u03bcm  with the assumption of uniform circularity set at 0.2\u20131.00. Clearance measurements (number, area) were exported to Excel for statistical analysis and the frequency of clearances was determined per \u03bcm  per given cell. \n\nTo follow CGs coming from TIRFM, iSIM and instant TIRF-SIM datasets, we performed semi-automated tracking using the plugin TrackMate Fiji Plugin  ( ). For particle detection, the difference of gaussian (DoG) detector was used with estimated blob diameter of 0.6\u2009\u03bcm, and an initial quality threshold of 120. The particles were further filtered using auto thresholds and linked with a simple linear assignment problem (LAP) linker. Linking and gap-closing distances were set to 1.0\u2009\u03bcm and the maximum frame gap was set to 2. \n\nWe developed a Python library for working with TrackMate output data and performing analysis. Briefly, TrackMate data were imported and tracks assigned unique identifiers. For each track, derived values were calculated for each timepoint such as displacement and percent of max intensity. Aggregate values were then calculated per track, such as   R  , slope, and p-value of linear regression of percent max intensity; bounding ellipses; duration; total displacement. Thresholds for duration classes (short, medium, long) were empirically determined based on histograms of duration. To identify tracks as approaching or vanishing, we required the linear regression of percent-of-max-intensity to have   R  \u2009>\u20090.6 (empirically determined based on histograms),   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, and either a positive (for approaching) or negative (for vanishing) slope. This algorithm can be generalized for analyses in other systems. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nUnpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s   t   test was used for comparison of two samples with normal distribution. N-1 chi-squared test was used for comparison of percentages.   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses and graphing were performed using Excel and SigmaPlot 12.3 (Systat Software). All bar and boxplot graphs presented in this study indicate the mean value and the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6531442, "text_md5": "f52e46a798e37bb0f5fde4f01a59deb7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 166], "journal": [167, 177], "publication_year": [179, 183], "title": [194, 312], "keywords": [326, 371], "abstract": [384, 1788], "body": [1797, 59249]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31118423, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-10171-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531442", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6531442"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531442\">6531442</a>", "list_title": "PMC6531442  Anchoring cortical granules in the cortex ensures trafficking to the plasma membrane for post-fertilization exocytosis"}

Lately, metagenomics has become the main source of new virus genomes. Here we describe a metagenomic analysis of the genomes of large and giant viruses from deep sea sediments. The assembled new virus genomes substantially expand the known diversity of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses of eukaryotes. The results support the concept of independent evolution of giant viruses from smaller ancestors in different virus branches. \n   ABSTRACT  \nThe nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) of eukaryotes (proposed order, \u201cMegavirales\u201d) include the families   Poxviridae  ,   Asfarviridae  ,   Iridoviridae  ,   Ascoviridae  ,   Phycodnaviridae  ,   Marseilleviridae  , and   Mimiviridae  , as well as still unclassified pithoviruses, pandoraviruses, molliviruses, and faustoviruses. Several of these virus groups include giant viruses, with genome and particle sizes exceeding those of many bacterial and archaeal cells. We explored the diversity of the NCLDV in deep sea sediments from the Loki\u2019s Castle hydrothermal vent area. Using metagenomics, we reconstructed 23 high-quality genomic bins of novel NCLDV, 15 of which are related to pithoviruses, 5 to marseilleviruses, 1 to iridoviruses, and 2 to klosneuviruses. Some of the identified pithovirus-like and marseillevirus-like genomes belong to deep branches in the phylogenetic tree of core NCLDV genes, substantially expanding the diversity and phylogenetic depth of the respective groups. The discovered viruses, including putative giant members of the family   Marseilleviridae  , have a broad range of apparent genome sizes, in agreement with the multiple, independent origins of gigantism in different branches of the NCLDV. Phylogenomic analysis reaffirms the monophyly of the pithovirus-iridovirus-marseillevirus branch of the NCLDV. Similarly to other giant viruses, the pithovirus-like viruses from Loki\u2019s Castle encode translation systems components. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes indicates a greater bacterial contribution than had been detected previously. Genome comparison suggests extensive gene exchange between members of the pithovirus-like viruses and   Mimiviridae  . Further exploration of the genomic diversity of Megavirales in additional sediment samples is expected to yield new insights into the evolution of giant viruses and the composition of the ocean megavirome. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) comprise an expansive group of viruses that infect diverse eukaryotes ( ). Most of the NCLDV share the defining biological feature of reproducing (primarily) in the cytoplasm of the infected cells as well as several genes encoding proteins involved in the key roles in virus morphogenesis and replication, leading to the conclusion that the NCLDV are monophyletic, that is, evolved from a single ancestral virus ( ,  ). As originally defined in 2001, the NCLDV included 5 families of viruses:   Poxviridae  ,   Asfarviridae  ,   Iridoviridae  ,   Ascoviridae  , and   Phycodnaviridae   ( ). Subsequent isolation of viruses from protists has resulted in the stunning discovery of giant viruses, with genome sizes exceeding those of many bacteria and archaea ( ). The originally discovered group of giant viruses forms the family   Mimiviridae   ( ). Subsequently, 3 additional other groups of giant viruses have been identified, namely, pandoraviruses ( ), pithoviruses, cedratviruses, orpheoviruses (here, the latter 3 groups of related viruses are collectively referred to as the putative family \u201cPithoviridae\u201d) ( ), and   Mollivirus sibericum   ( ), along with two new groups of NCLDV with genomes of moderate size, the family   Marseilleviridae   ( ,  ) and the faustoviruses ( ,  ). Most of the NCLDV have icosahedral virions composed of a double-jelly-roll major capsid protein(s) (MCP), but poxviruses have distinct brick-shaped virions, ascoviruses have ovoid virions, molliviruses have a spherical virion, and, finally, pandoraviruses and pithoviruses have unusual, amphora-shaped virions. The pithovirus virions are the largest among the currently known viruses. Several of the recently discovered groups of NCLDV, in particular, the putative family \u201cPithoviridae\u201d ( ), are likely to eventually become new families, and reclassification of the NCLDV into a new virus order, \u201cMegavirales,\u201d has been proposed ( ,  ). \n\nPhylogenomic reconstruction of gene gain and loss events resulted in mapping about 50 of the genes that are responsible for the key viral functions to the putative last common ancestor of the NCLDV. The existence of this large common gene contingent strongly supports the idea of the monophyly of the NCLDV despite the fact that their genome sizes differ by more than an order of magnitude and that their virions demonstrate remarkable morphological diversity ( ,  ,  ). However, detailed phylogenetic analysis of the core genes of the NCLDV has revealed considerable evolutionary complexity, including numerous cases of displacement of ancestral genes with homologs from other sources and even some cases of independent capture of homologous genes ( ). The genomes of the NCLDV encompass about 100 (some iridoviruses) to nearly 2,500 genes (pandoraviruses), including, in addition to the 50 or so core genes, numerous genes involved in various aspects of virus-host interaction, in particular, suppression of the host defense mechanisms, as well as many genes for which no function could be identified ( ,  ). \n\nThe NCLDV include some viruses that are agents of devastating human and animal diseases, such as smallpox virus or African swine fever virus ( ,  ), as well as viruses that infect algae and other planktonic protists and are important ecological agents ( ,  ). Additionally, NCLDV elicit the strong interest of many researchers due to their large genome size, which, in the case of the giant viruses, falls within the range of typical genome sizes of bacteria and archaea. This apparent exceptional position of the giant viruses in the virosphere, together with the fact that they encode multiple proteins that are universal among cellular organisms (in particular, translation system components), has led to the devising of provocative scenarios of the origin and evolution of giant viruses. It has been proposed that the giant viruses were descendants of a hypothetical, probably extinct fourth domain of cellular life that evolved via drastic genome reduction, and support of this scenario has been claimed from phylogenetic analysis of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) encoded by giant viruses ( ,  ,  ). However, even apart from the conceptual difficulties inherent in the postulated cell-to-virus transition ( ,  ), phylogenetic analysis of expanded sets of translation-related proteins encoded by giant viruses has resulted in tree topologies that were poorly compatible with the fourth domain hypothesis but that instead suggest piecemeal acquisition of these genes, likely from different eukaryotic hosts ( ,  ,  ). \n\nMore generally, probabilistic reconstruction of gene gains and losses during the evolution of the NCLDV has revealed a highly dynamic evolutionary regime ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) that has been conceptualized in the so-called \u201cgenomic accordion\u201d model, according to which virus evolution proceeds via alternating phases of extensive gene capture and gene loss ( ,  ). In particular, in the course of the NCLDV evolution, giant viruses appear to have evolved from smaller ones on multiple, independent occasions ( ,  ,  ). \n\nIn recent years, metagenomics has become the principal route of new virus discovery ( ). However, in the case of giant viruses,   Acanthamoeba   coculturing has remained the main source of new virus identification, and this methodology has been refined to allow high-throughput giant virus isolation ( ,  ). To date, over 150 species of giant viruses have been isolated from various environments, including water towers, soil, sewage, rivers, fountains, seawater, and marine sediments ( ). The true diversity of giant viruses is difficult to assess, but the explosion of giant virus discovery during the last 10 years and data from large-scale metagenomic screens of viral diversity indicate that a major part of the virome of Earth remains unexplored ( ). The core genes of the NCLDV can serve as bait for screening environmental sequences, and pipelines have been developed for large-scale screening of metagenomes ( ,  ). Although these efforts have given indications of the presence of uncharacterized giant viruses in samples from various environments, few of these putative novel viruses can be characterized due to the lack of genomic information. Furthermore, giant viruses tend to be overlooked in viral metagenomic studies since samples are typically filtered according to the preconception of typical virion sizes ( ). \n\nTo gain further insight into the ecology, evolution, and genomic content of giant viruses, it is necessary to retrieve more genomes rather than simply establish their presence by detection of single marker genes. Metagenomic binning is the process of clustering environmental sequences that belong to the same genome, based on features such as base composition and coverage. Binning has previously been used to reconstruct the genomes of large groups of uncharacterized bacteria and archaea in a culture-independent approach ( ,  ). Only one case of binning has been reported for NCLDV, when the genomes of the klosneuviruses, distant relatives of the mimiviruses, were reconstructed from a simple wastewater sludge metagenome ( ). More-complex metagenomes from all types of environments remain to be explored. However, standard methods for screening and binning of NCLDV have not yet been developed, and sequences of these viruses can be difficult to classify because of the occurrence of substantial horizontal gene transfer from bacteria and eukaryotes ( ,  ,  ,  ) and also because a large proportion of the NCLDV genes (known as ORFans [open reading frames [ORFs] with no detectable homology to other ORFs in a database]) have no detectable homologs ( ,  ). \n\nWe identified NCLDV sequences in deep sea sediment metagenomes from Loki\u2019s Castle, a sample site that has been previously shown to be rich in uncharacterized prokaryotes ( ,  ) (J. E. Dharamshi, D. Tamarit, L. Eme, C. Stairs, J. Martijn, F. Homa, S. L. J\u00f8rgensen, A. Spang, T. J. G. Ettema, submitted for publication). The complexity of the data and genomes required a combination of different binning methods, assembly improvement by reads profiling, and manual refinement of each bin to minimize contamination from nonviral sequences. As a result, 23 high-quality genomic bins of novel NCLDV were reconstructed, including (mostly) distant relatives of \u201c  Pithoviridae  ,\u201d   Orpheovirus  , and   Marseilleviridae  , as well as two relatives of klosneuviruses. These findings substantially expand the diversity of the NCLDV, in particular, the pithovirus-iridovirus-marseillevirus (PIM) branch, further supporting the scenario of independent evolution of giant viruses from smaller ones in different branches of the NCLDV, and provide an initial characterization of the ocean megavirome. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Putative NCLDV in the Loki\u2019s Castle metagenome. \n  \nScreening of the Loki\u2019s Castle metagenomes for NCLDV DNA polymerase (DNAP) sequences revealed remarkable diversity ( ; see also Fig. S2 in   in the supplemental material). Using two main binning approaches, namely, differential coverage (DC) binning and coassembly (CA) binning ( ), we retrieved 23 high-quality bins of putative new NCLDVs ( ). The highest-quality bins were identified by comparing the DC and the CA bins, based on decreasing the total number of contiguous sequences (contigs) and the number of contigs without NCLDV hits, while preserving completeness (see Table S6 in  ). \n  \nDiversity of the NCLDV DNAP sequences in the Loki\u2019s Castle sediment metagenomes (orange) and in the Tara Oceans (turquoise) and EarthVirome (purple) databases. Reference sequences are shown in black. The binned NCLDV genomes are marked with a star. Branches with bootstrap values above 95 are marked with a black circle. The maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed as described in Materials and Methods. \n    \nFlowchart of the metagenomic binning procedures. Two main binning approaches were used: differential coverage (DC) binning and coassembly (CA) binning. For DC binning, reads from four different samples were assembled into four metagenomes. The metagenomes were screened for NCLDV DNAP, and contigs were binned with CONCOCT and ESOM. The raw CONCOCT and ESOM bins were combined and refined using mmgenome. The refined bins were put through taxonomic filtering, keeping only the contigs encoding at least one NCLDV gene, and were finally reassembled. For CA binning, a database containing the refined DC bins and NCLDV reference genomes was used to create profiles to extract reads from the metagenomes. The reads were combined and coassembled. This step was followed by CONCOCT binning, mmgenome bin refinement, and taxonomic filtering. Finally, the DC bins and CA bins were annotated and the best bins were chosen by comparing sequence statistics, completeness and redundancy of marker genes, and marker gene phylogenies (see   for details). \n    \nThe 23 NCLDV bins from Loki\u2019s Castle \n    \nDifferential coverage binning was performed first, resulting in 29 genomic bins. Initial quality assessment showed that most of the bins were inflated and fragmented and contained many short (<5-kb) contigs which were difficult to classify as contamination or   bona fide   NCLDV sequences and that some bins were likely to contain sequences from two or more viral genomes, as judged by the presence of marker genes belonging to different families of the NCLDV (see Fig. S19 to S20 in  ). The more contigs a bin contains, the higher the risk is that some could represent contaminants that bin together because of similar nucleotide compositions and levels of read coverage. Therefore, sequence read profiling followed by coassembly binning was performed in an attempt to increase the size of the contigs and thus to obtain additional information for binning and bin refinement. For most of the bins, the coassembly led to a decrease in the number of contigs without loss of completeness or even led to improvement in the data (see Table S6 in  ). \n\nA key issue with metagenomic binning is whether contigs are binned together because they belong to the same genome or are binned together because they simply display similar nucleotide compositions and levels of read coverage. In general, contigs were retained if they contained at least one gene with BLASTP top hits corresponding to NCLDV proteins. Some contigs encoded proteins with only bacterial, archaeal, and/or eukaryotic BLASTP top hits, and because the larger NCLDV genomes contain islands enriched in genes of bacterial origin ( ,  ), it was unclear which sequences potentially represented contaminants. A combination of gene content, read coverage, and composition information was used to identify potential contaminating sequences. Contigs shorter than 5\u2009kb were also discarded because such contigs generally do not contain enough information to reliably establish their origin, but this strict filtering also means that the size of the genomes could be underestimated and some genomic information lost. Reassuringly, no traces of rRNA or ribosomal protein genes were identified in any of the NCLDV genome bins, which would have been represented a clear case of contaminating cellular sequences. Altogether, of the 336 contigs in the 23 final genome bins, 243 (72%) could be confidently assigned to NCLDV on the basis of the presence of at least one NCLDV-specific gene. \n\nThe content of the 23 NCLDV-related bins was analyzed in more depth ( ). The bins included 1 to 30 contigs, with the total length of nonoverlapping sequences ranging from about 200 kb to more than 750 kb, suggesting that some might contain (nearly) complete NCLDV genomes, although it is difficult to arrive at any definitive conclusions with respect to completeness on the basis of length alone because the genome sizes of even closely related NCLDV can differ substantially. A much more reliable approach is to assess the representation of core genes that are expected to be conserved in (nearly) all NCLDV. The translated protein sequences from the 23 bins were searched for homologs of conserved NCLDV genes using PSI-BLAST, with profiles of the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Group (NCVOG) collection employed as queries ( ) (see   in the supplemental material for protein annotations). In 14 of the 23 bins, (nearly) complete sets of the core NCLDV genes were identified ( ), suggesting that those bins contained (nearly) complete genomes of putative new viruses (here, LCV [for \u201cLoki\u2019s Castle viruses\u201d]). Notably, the pithovirus-like LCV lack the packaging ATPase of the FtsK family that is encoded in all other NCLDV genomes but not in the available pithovirus genomes. Several bins contained more than one copy of certain conserved genes. Some of these could represent actual paralogs, but, given that duplication of most of these conserved genes (e.g., DNA polymerase in bin LCPAC202 or RNA polymerase B subunit in bins LCPAC201 and LCPAC202) is unprecedented among NCLDV, it appears likely that several bins are heterogeneous, with each containing sequences from two closely related virus genomes. \n\nWith all due caution because of the lack of fully assembled virus genomes, the range of the apparent genome sizes of the pithovirus-like and marseillevirus-like LCV is notable ( ). The characteristic size of the genomes in the family \u201cPithoviridae\u201d is about 600\u2009kb ( ), but, among the pithovirus-like LCV, only one, LCPAC304, reached and even exceeded that size. The rest of the LCV genomes are substantially smaller, and although some are likely to be incomplete, given that certain core genes are missing, others, such as LCPAC104, with a total length of contigs of only 218\u2009kb, encompass all the core genes ( ). \n\nThe typical genome size in the family   Marseilleviridae   is between 350 and 400\u2009kb ( ), but among the LCV, genomes of two putative marseillevirus-like viruses, LCMAC101 and LCMAC202, appear to exceed 700\u2009kb, well into the giant virus range. Although LCMAC202 contains two uncharacteristic duplications of core genes, raising the possibility of heterogeneity, LCMAC101 contains all core genes in a single copy and thus appears to represent an actual giant virus. Thus, the family   Marseilleviridae   seems to be joining the NCLDV families that evolved virus gigantism. \n\nA concatenation of the three most highly conserved proteins, namely, NCLDV major capsid protein (MCP), DNA polymerase (DNAP), and A18-like helicase (A18Hel), was used for phylogenetic analysis (see Materials and Methods for details). Among the putative new NCLDV, 15 cluster with pithoviruses ( ). These new representatives greatly expand the scope of the family \u201cPithoviridae.\u201d Indeed, 8 of the 15 form a putative (weakly supported) clade that is the sister group of all currently known \u201cPithoviridae\u201d (Pithovirus, Cedratvirus, and Orpheovirus), 5 more comprise a deeper clade, and LCDPAC02 represents the deepest lineage of the pithovirus-like viruses ( ). Additionally, 5 of the putative new NCLDV are affiliated with the family   Marseilleviridae  , and similarly to the case of pithovirus-like viruses, two of these comprise the deepest branch in the marseillevirus-like subtree (although the monophyly of this subtree is weakly supported) ( ). Another LCV represents a distinct lineage within the family   Iridoviridae   ( ). The topologies of the phylogenetic trees for individual conserved NLCDV genes were mostly compatible with these affinities of the putative new viruses ( ). Taken together, these findings substantially expand the pithovirus-iridovirus-marseillevirus (PIM) clade of the NCLDV, and the inclusion of the LCV in the phylogeny confidently reaffirms the previously observed monophyly of this branch ( ). Finally, two LCV belong to the   Klosneuvirus   branch (putative subfamily \u201cKlosneuvirinae\u201d) within the family   Mimiviridae   ( , inset). \n  \nPhylogenetic tree of three concatenated, universally conserved NCLDV proteins: DNA polymerase, major capsid protein, and A18-like helicase. Support values were obtained using 100 bootstrap replications; branches with less than 50% support were collapsed. Scale bars represent the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The inset shows the   Mimiviridae   branch. Triangles show collapsed branches. The LCV sequences are color-coded as follows: red, pithovirus-like virus; green, marseillevirus-like virus (a deep branch is shown in dark green); orange, iridovirus-like virus; blue, mimivirus (klosneuvirus)-like virus. \n  \n\n### Translation system components encoded by Loki\u2019s Castle viruses. \n  \nSimilarly to other NCLDV with giant and large genomes, the LCV show patchy distributions of genes coding for translation system components. Such genes were identified in 11 of the 23 bins ( ; see also  ). None of the putative new viruses has a (nearly) complete set of translation-related genes (minus the ribosome) such as have been observed in klosneuviruses ( ) or tupanviruses ( ). Nevertheless, several of the putative pithovirus-like viruses encode multiple translation-related proteins, e.g., bin LCMAC202, which encompasses 6 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) and 6 translation factors, and bin LCMAC201, with 4 aaRS and 5 translation factors ( ). Additionally, 12 of the 23 bins encode predicted tRNAs, up to 22 in bin LCMAC202 ( ). \n  \nTranslation-related proteins and tRNAs in Loki\u2019s Castle NCLDV \n    \nGiven the special status of the translation system components in the discussions of the NCLDV evolution, we constructed phylogenies for all these genes, including genes corresponding to the LCV and all other NCLDV. The results of this phylogenetic analysis ( ; see also  ) reveal complex evolutionary trends, some of which that have not been apparent in previous analyses of NCLDV evolution. First, in most cases, when multiple LCV encompass genes for homologous translation system components, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates polyphyly of these genes. Notable examples include translation eukaryotic initiation factor 2b (eIF2b), aspartyl/asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnS), tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrS), and methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetS;  ). Thus, the eIF2b tree includes 3 unrelated LCV branches, one of which, not unexpectedly, clusters with homologs from marseilleviruses and mimiviruses; another is affiliated with two klosneuviruses, and the third appears to have an independent eukaryotic origin ( ). The AsnS tree includes a group of LCV that cluster within a mixed bacterial and archaeal branch that also includes two other NCLDV, namely, hokovirus of the klosneuvirus group and a phycodnavirus. Another LCV AsnS belongs to a group of apparent eukaryotic origin, and, finally, one belongs to a primarily archaeal clade ( ; see also  ). Of the 3 TyrS found in LCV, two cluster with the homologs from klosneuviruses within a branch of apparent eukaryotic origin and the third within another part of the same branch, where it groups with the orpheovirus TyrS; notably, the same branch includes homologs from pandoraviruses ( ). Of the two examples of MetS, one groups with homologs from klosneuviruses whereas the other one appears to be of independent eukaryotic origin ( ). These observations are compatible with previous conclusions concerning multiple, parallel acquisitions of genes for translation system components by different groups of NCLDV (primarily giant viruses but, to a lesser extent, also those with smaller genomes), apparently under evolutionary pressure for modulation of host translation, which remains to be studied experimentally. \n  \nPhylogenies of selected translation system components encoded by Loki\u2019s Castle viruses. (A) Translation initiation factor eIF2b. (B) Aspartyl/asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnS). (C) Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrS). (D) Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetS). All branches are color-coded according to taxonomic affinity (see   for the full trees). The numbers at the internal branches indicate (percent) local likelihood-based support. \n  \nAnother clear trend among the translation-related genes of the pithovirus-like LCV is the affinity of several of them with homologs from klosneuviruses and, in some cases, mimiviruses. All 4 examples mentioned about include genes of this provenance, and additional cases include genes encoding GlyS, IleS, ProS, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, translation factors eIF1a and eIF2a, and peptide chain release factor eRF1 ( ). Given that the LCV set includes two Klosneuvirus-like bins, in addition to the pithovirus-like ones, these observations imply extensive gene exchange between distinct NCLDV in the habitats from which these viruses originate. Klosneuviruses that are conspicuously rich in translation-related genes might serve as the main donors. \n\n\n### Gene content analysis of the Loki\u2019s Castle viruses. \n  \nGiven that the addition of the LCV has greatly expanded the family   Marseilleviridae   and the pithovirus group and has reaffirmed the monophyly of the PIM branch of NCLDV, we constructed, analyzed and annotated clusters of putative orthologous genes for this group of viruses as well as for an automatically generated version of clusters of homologous genes for all NCLDV ( ). Altogether, 8,066 NCLDV gene clusters were identified, a substantial majority of which were family specific. Nevertheless, almost 200 clusters were found to be shared between the \u201cPithoviridae\u201d and   Marseilleviridae   families ( ). The numbers of genes shared by each of these families with   Iridoviridae   were much lower, conceivably because of the small genome size of iridoviruses that could have undergone reductive evolution ( ). In contrast, there was considerable overlap between the PIM group gene clusters and those of mimiviruses, presumably due to the large genome sizes of the mimiviruses but potentially also reflecting substantial horizontal gene flow between mimiviruses, pithoviruses, and marseilleviruses ( ). Only 13 genes comprised a genomic signature of the PIM group, that is, of genes that were shared by its three constituent families to the exclusion of the rest of the NCLDV. \n  \nShared and unique genes in four NCLDV families that include Loki\u2019s Castle viruses. The numbers correspond to NCLDV clusters that contain at least one protein from   Mimiviridae  ,   Marseilleviridae  ,   Pithoviridae  , and   Iridoviridae   but are absent from other NCLDV families. \n  \nTo further explore the relationships between the gene repertoires of the PIM group and other NCLDV, we constructed a neighbor-joining tree from the data on gene presence-absence ( ). Notwithstanding the limited gene sharing, the topology of the resulting tree ( ) closely recapitulated the phylogenetic tree of the conserved core genes ( ). In particular, the PIM group appears as a clade in the gene presence-absence tree, albeit with comparatively low support ( ). Thus, despite the paucity of PIM-specific genes and the substantial differences in genome sizes between the three virus families, gene gain and loss processes within the viral genetic core appear to track the evolution of the universally conserved genes. \n  \nGene presence-absence tree of the NCLDV that include the Loki\u2019s Castle viruses. The neighbor-joining dendrogram was reconstructed from the matrix of pairwise distances calculated from binary phyletic patterns of the NCLDV clusters. The numbers at internal branches indicate (percent) bootstrap support; data below 50% are not shown. \n  \nThe genomes of microbes and large viruses encompass many lineage-specific genes (often denoted ORFans) that, in the course of evolution, are lost and gained by horizontal gene transfer at extremely high rates ( ). Therefore, the gene repertoire of a microbial or viral species (notwithstanding the well-known difficulties with the species definition) or group is best characterized by the pangenome, i.e., the entirety of genes represented in all isolates in the group ( ). Most microbes have \u201copen\u201d pangenomes such that every sequenced genome adds new genes to the pangenome ( ,  ). The NCLDV pangenomes could be even wider, judging from the high percentage of ORFans, especially in giant viruses ( ). Examination of the PIM gene clusters shows that 757 (48%) of the 1,572 clusters were unique to the LCV, that is, had no detectable homologs in other members of the group. Taking into account also the 4,147 ORFans, the LCV represent the bulk of the PIM group pangenome. Among the NCLDV clusters, 1,100 of the 8,066 (14%) are LCV specific. Thus, notwithstanding the limitations of the automated clustering procedure, which could miss some distant similarities between proteins, the discovery of the LCV substantially expands not only the pangenome of the PIM group but also the overall NCLDV pangenome. \n\nAnnotation of the genes characteristic of (but not necessarily exclusive to) the PIM group reveals numerous, highly diverse functions of either bacterial or eukaryotic provenance as suggested by the taxonomic affiliations of homologs detected in database searches ( ). For example, a functional group of interest shared by the three families in the PIM group includes genes of apparent bacterial origin involved in various DNA repair processes and nucleotide metabolism. The results of phylogenetic analysis of these genes are generally compatible with bacterial origin, although many branches are mixed and also include archaea and/or eukaryotes, indicating horizontal gene transfer ( ). Notably, these trees illustrate the \u201chidden complexity\u201d of NCLDV evolution whereby homologous genes are independently captured by different groups of viruses. The PIM group forms a clade in the trees for the two subunits of the SbcCD nuclease, but the homologs in mimiviruses appear to be of distinct origin (  and  ), whereas the PIM group itself splits between 3 branches in the trees for exonuclease V and deoxynucleotide monophosphate (DNMP) kinase (  and  ). The latter two trees also contain branches in which different groups of the NCLDV, in particular, marseilleviruses and mimiviruses, are mixed, apparently reflecting gene exchange between distinct viruses infecting the same host, such as amoeba. \n  \nPhylogenies of selected repair and nucleotide metabolism genes of the pithovirus-iridovirus-marseillevirus group that includes Loki\u2019s Castle viruses.

Two virophage-like sequences were retrieved from Loki Castle metagenomes. According to the MCP phylogeny, they form a separate branch within the Sputnik-like group ( ). This affiliation implies that these virophages are parasites of mimiviruses. Besides MCP, both Loki\u2019s Castle virophages encode the proteins involved in virion morphogenesis, namely, minor capsid protein, packaging ATPase, and cysteine protease ( ; see also   for protein annotations). Apart from these core genes, however, these virophages differ from Sputnik. In particular, they lack the gene for the primase-helicase fusion protein that is characteristic of Sputnik and its close relatives ( ), but each encodes a distinct helicase ( ; see also   for additional virophage genome maps). \n  \nLoki\u2019s Castle virophages.

Reference virophages from GenBank are marked with black font (the three prototype virophages are shown in bold); environmental virophages are shown in blue ( ) and green (wgs portion of GenBank). (B) Genome maps of Loki\u2019s Castle virophages compared with Sputnik virophage. Green and blue triangles mark direct and inverted repeats. Pentagons with a thick outline represent conserved virophage genes. \n  \n\n### Putative promoter motifs in LCV and Loki\u2019s Castle virophages. \n  \nTo identify possible promoter sequences in the LCV genomes, we searched \u201cupstream\u201d regions of the predicted LCV genes for recurring motifs using MEME software (see Materials and Methods for details). In most of the bins, we identified a conserved motif similar to the early promoters of poxviruses and mimiviruses ( ) (AAAnTGA) that is typically located within 40 to 20 nucleotides upstream of the predicted start codon (for the search results, see  ). To assess possible bin contamination, we calculated the frequencies of the conserved motifs per contig for marseillevirus-like and mimivirus-like bins. None of the contigs showed significantly reduced frequencies of the conserved motif ( ), supporting the idea of the virus origin of all the contigs. \n\nNotably, the LCV virophage genomes also contain a conserved AT-rich motif upstream of each gene which is likely to correspond to the late promoter of their hosts, similarly to the case of the Sputnik virophage that carries late mimivirus promoters ( ). However, the genomes of the two putative klosneuviruses (LCMiAC01 and LCMiAC02) that are not represented among the LCV do not contain obvious counterparts to these predicted virophage promoters ( ). Therefore, it appears most likely that the hosts of these virophages are mimiviruses that are not represented in the LCV sequence set. \n\nOf further interest is the detection of pronounced promoter-like motifs for pithovirus-like LCV ( ) and iridovirus-like LCV ( ). To our knowledge, no conserved promoter motifs have been identified so far for these groups of viruses. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nMetagenomics has become the primary means of new virus discovery ( ,  ,  ). Metagenomic sequence analysis has greatly expanded knowledge of many groups of viruses such that the viruses that were identified earlier by traditional methods have become isolated branches in the overall evolutionary trees, in which most of the diversity comes from metagenomic sequences ( ). The analysis of the Loki\u2019s Castle metagenome reported here similarly expanded the   Pithovirus   branch of the NCLDV, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the   Marseillevirus   branch. Although only one LCV genome, that of a marseillevirus-like virus, appears to be complete and on a single contig, several other genomes seem to be nearly complete, and overall, the LCV genomic data are sufficient to dramatically expand the pangenome of the PIM group, to add substantially to the NCLDV pangenome as well, and to reveal notable evolutionary trends. First, the LCV retain all or most of the NCLDV core genes, reinforcing the previously established monophyly analysis of this vast assemblage of large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses infecting diverse eukaryotes ( ,  ,  ). The conservation of the gene core inherited from the common virus ancestor of the NCLDV contrasts with the dynamic character of the NCLDV evolution, which involved extensive gene gain and loss, yielding viruses that span a range of about 100 to about 2,500 genes ( ,  ,  ). More specifically, the results determined in the present work demonstrate the independent origin of giant viruses in more than one clade within both the   Pithovirus   and the   Marseillevirus   branches. Although this observation should be interpreted with caution, given the lack of fully assembled LCV genomes, it supports and extends the previous conclusions with respect to the evolution of the NCLDV in the genomic accordion regime that led to the independent, convergent evolution of viral gigantism in several or perhaps even all NCLDV families ( ,  ,  ,  ). Conversely, these findings are incompatible with the concept of reductive evolution of NCLDV from giant viruses as the principal evolutionary mode. Another notable evolutionary trend emerging from the LCV genome comparison is the apparent extensive gene exchange between pithovirus-like and marseillevirus-like viruses and the members of the   Mimiviridae  . Finally, note that the LCV analysis reaffirms, on a greatly expanded data set, the previously proposed monophyly of the PIM group of the NCLDV, demonstrating robustness of the evolutionary analysis of conserved NCLDV genes ( ,  ). Furthermore, a congruent tree topology was obtained by gene content analysis, indicating that, despite the open pangenomes and the dominance of unique genes, the evolution of the genetic core of the NCLDV appears to track the sequence divergence of the universal marker genes. \n\nLike other giant viruses, several LCV encode multiple translation system components. Although none of them rivals the nearly complete translation systems encoded by klosneuviruses ( ), orpheoviruses ( ), and, especially, tupanviruses ( ), some are comparable, in this regard, to the mimiviruses ( ). The diverse origins of the translation system components in LCV suggested by phylogenetic analysis are compatible with the previous conclusions on the piecemeal capture of these genes by giant viruses as opposed to inheritance from a common ancestor ( ,  ). \n\nThe 23 NCLDV genome bins reconstructed in the present study represent only a small fraction of the full NCLDV diversity as determined by analysis of DNA polymerase sequences present in marine sediments ( ). Notably, sequences closely matching the sequences in the NCLDV genome bins were identified only in the Loki\u2019s Castle metagenomes and not in Tara Oceans water column metagenomes or Earth Virome sequences. Thus, the deep sea sediments represent a unique and unexplored habitat for NCLDVs. Further studies targeting deep sea sediments will bring new insights into the diversity and genomic potential of these viruses. \n\nIdentification of the host range is one of the most difficult problems in metaviromics and also in the study of giant viruses, even by traditional methods. Most of the giant viruses have been isolated by cocultivation with model amoeba species, and the natural hosts remain unknown. Notable exceptions are the giant viruses isolated from the marine flagellates   Cafeteria roenbergensis   ( ) and   Bodo saltans   ( ). The principal approach for inferring the virus host range from metagenomics data is the analysis of co-occurrence of virus sequences with those of potential hosts ( ,  ). However, virtually no 18S rRNA gene sequences of eukaryotic origin were detected in the Loki\u2019s Castle sediment samples, in sharp contrast to the results of analysis of rich prokaryotic microbiota ( ,  ). The absence of potential eukaryotic hosts of the LCV strongly suggests that these viruses do not reproduce in the sediments but rather might originate from virus particles that precipitate from different parts of the water column. So far, however, no closely related sequences have been found in water column metagenomes ( ). The eukaryotic hosts might have inhabited the shallower sediments, and although they would have decomposed over time, the resilient virus particles remain as a \u201cfossil record.\u201d Clearly, the hosts of these viruses remain to be identified. An obvious and important limitation of this work\u2014as in any such metagenomic study\u2014is that the viruses discovered here (we are now in a position to refer to the viruses without quotation marks, given the recent decisions of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [ICTV]) have not been grown in a host culture. Accordingly, our understanding of their biology is limited to the inferences made from the genomic sequence which, perforce, cannot yield the complete picture. In the case of the NCLDV, the effects of these limitations are exacerbated by the fact that their genomic DNA is not infectious; therefore, even the availability of the complete genome does not enable growth of the virus. The metagenomic analyses must complement rather than replace traditional virology and newer culturomic approaches. \n\nAlthough the sediment samples used in this study have not been dated directly, determinations of sedimentation rates in nearby areas show that these rates range between 1 and 5\u2009cm per 1,000\u2009years ( ,  ). With the highest sedimentation rate considered, the sediments could be over 20,600\u2009years old at the deepest level (103\u2009cm). Considering that   Pithovirus sibericum   and   Mollivirus sibericum   were revived from 30,000-year-old permafrost ( ,  ), it might be possible to resuscitate some of the LCVs using similar methods. Isolation experiments performed with giant viruses from deep sea sediments, now that we are aware of their presence, would be the natural next step in learning more about their biology. \n\nRegardless, the discovery of the LCV substantially expands the known ocean megavirome and demonstrates the previously unsuspected high prevalence of pithovirus-like viruses. Given that all this diversity comes from a single site on the ocean floor, it appears clear that the megavirome is large and diverse and that metagenomics analysis of NCLDV from other sites will bring many surprises. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Sampling and metagenomic sequencing. \n  \nIn the previous studies of microbial diversity in the deep sea sediments, samples were retrieved from three sites about 15\u2009km northeast of the Loki's Castle hydrothermal vent field (see Table S1 in   in the supplemental material) by gravity (GS10_GC14 and GS08_GC12) and by piston coring (GS10_PC15) ( ,  ,  ). \n\nDNA was extracted and sequenced, and metagenomes were assembled as part of the previous studies (  [for GS10_GC14], Dharamshi et al. [submitted] [for GS08_GC12 and GS10_PC15]), resulting in the assemblies LKC75, KR126, K940, K1000, and K1060. Contiguous sequences (contigs)   longer than   1\u2009kb were selected for further processing. \n\n\n### Identification of viral metagenomic sequences. \n  \nProtein sequences of the metagenomic contigs were predicted using Prodigal v.2.6.3 ( ) in the metagenomics mode. A collection of DNAP sequences from 11 NCLDV was used to query the metagenomic protein sequence with BLASTP ( ) (see Table S1 in  ). The BLASTP hits were filtered according to E value (maximum, 1e ), alignment length (at least 50% of the query length), and identity (greater than 30%). The sequences were aligned using MAFFT-LINSI software ( ). Reference NCLDV DNAP sequences were extracted from the NCVOG collection ( ). Highly divergent sequences and those containing large gap insertions were removed from the alignment, followed by realignment. The terminal regions of the alignments were trimmed manually using Jalview ( ), and internal gaps were removed using trimAl (v.1.4.rev15 [ ]) with the option \u201cgappyout.\u201d IQTree version 1.5.0a ( ) was used to construct maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replications ( ). The built-in model test ( ) was used to select the best evolutionary model according to the Bayesian information criterion (LG+F+I+G4; see Fig. S1 in  ). Contigs belonging to novel NCLDVs were identified and used for binning. \n\n\n### Composition-based binning (ESOM). \n  \nAll sequences of the KR126, K940, K1000, and K1060 assemblies were split into fragments of minimum lengths of 5 or 10\u2009kb at intervals of 5 or 10\u2009kb and were clustered using tetranucleotide frequencies and Emergent Self Organizing maps (ESOM [ ]), generating one map per assembly (see  ). Bins were identified by viewing the maps using the Databionic ESOM viewer ( ) and manually choosing the contigs clustering together with the putative NCLDV contigs in an \u201cisland\u201d (see Fig. S3 in  ). \n\n\n### Differential coverage binning of metagenomic contigs. \n  \nDifferential coverage (DC) bins were generated for the KR126, K940, K1000, and K1060 metagenomes, according to the method of Dharamshi et al. (submitted). Briefly, Kallisto version 0.42.5 ( ) was used to get the differential coverage data for each read mapped onto each focal metagenome, with CONCOCT version 0.4.1 used to collect sequences into bins ( ). CONCOCT was run with three different contig size thresholds (2\u2009kb, 3\u2009kb, and 5\u2009kb), and longer contigs were cut up into smaller fragments (10\u2009kb), to decrease coverage and compositional bias, and merged again after the CONCOCT binning (see Dharamshi et al. [submitted] for further details). Bins containing contigs with the viral DNAP were selected and refined in mmgenome ( ). Finally, to resolve overlapping sequences in the DC bins, the reads of each bin were extracted using seqtk (version 1.0-r82-dirty;  ) and the read-mapping files generated for mmgenome and were reassembled using SPAdes (3.6.0, multi-cell, \u2013careful mode [ ]). The coverage and quality of the data corresponding to the bins from KR126 were too low, and the data were discarded from further analysis. \n\n\n### Coassembly binning of metagenomic contigs. \n  \nCLARK ( ), a program for classification of reads using discriminative k-mers, was used to identify reads belonging to NCLDV in the metagenomes. A target set of 10 reference genomes that represented klosneuviruses,   Marseilleviridae  , and \u201cPithoviridae\u201d (see Table S2 in  ), as well as the 29 original bins, was used to make a database of spaced k-mers which CLARK used to classify the reads of the K940, K1000, and K1060 metagenomes (full mode, k-mer size 31). Reads classified as related to any of the targets were extracted, and the reads from all three metagenomes were pooled and reassembled using SPAdes (3.9.0 [ ]). Because CLARK removes k-mers that are not discriminatory, the reads for sequences that are similar between the bins might not have been included. Therefore, the reads from each original bin that were used for the first set reassemblies were also included and were pooled with the CLARK-classified reads before reassembly. \n\nFour SPAdes modes were tested: metagenomic (\u2013meta), single-cell (\u2013sc), multicell (default), and multicell careful (\u2013careful). The quality of the assemblies was tested by identifying the contigs containing NCVOG0038 (DNA polymerase), using BLASTP ( ). The multicell careful assembly had the longest DNAP-containing contigs and was used for CONCOCT binning. \n\nCONCOCT was run as described above, except that only reads from the coassembly were used as the input. Bins containing NCVOG0038 were identified by BLASTP. The smaller the contig size threshold, the greater the number of ambiguous and potentially contaminating sequences observed; therefore, the CONCOCT 5-kb run was chosen to extract and refine new bins. The bins were refined by using mmgenome as described below. \n\n\n### Quality assessment and refinement of metagenomic NCLDV bins. \n  \nGeneral sequence statistics were calculated by Quast (v. 3.2 [ ]). Barrnap (v 0.8 [ ]) was used to check for the presence of rRNA genes, with a length threshold of 0.1. Prokka (v1.12 [ ]) was used to annotate open reading frames (ORFs) of the raw bins. The presence or absence of a megavirus marker gene in each metagenomic bin was estimated by using the micomplete pipeline ( ) and a set of the 10 conserved NCLDV genes (see Table S3 in  ). This information was used to assess completeness and redundancy. The presence of two or more copies of each marker gene was considered an indication of potential contamination or of the presence of two or more copies of viral genomes per bin, and such bins were further refined. \n\nThe mmgenome was used to manually refine the metagenomic bins by plotting coverage and GC content, showing read linkages, and highlighting contigs with marker genes ( ) (see   and  ). Overlap of the ESOM binned contigs and the DC bins was also visualized. Bins containing only one genome were refined by removing contigs with different compositions and levels of coverage. In cases in which several genomes were represented in the same CONCOCT bin, they were separated into different bins when distinct clusters were clearly visible (see the supplemental materials and methods in   for examples of the refining process). \n\nRead linkages were determined by mapping the metagenomic reads onto the assembly using bowtie2 (version 2.3.2 [ ]) and samtools (version 1.2 [ ]) to index and convert the mapping file into bam format; finally, a script provided by the CONCOCT suite was used to count the number of read pairs that mapped to the first or last kilobase of two different contigs (bam_to_linkage.py, \u2013regionlength 1000). \n\nDiamond aligner BLASTP ( ) was used to query the protein sequences of the refined bins against the NCBI nonredundant protein database (latest date of search, 13 Febuary 2018), with a maximum E value of 1e . Taxonomic information from the top BLASTP hit for each gene was used for taxonomic filtering. Contigs that had 50% or more bacterial or archaeal hits (compared to an absence of significant hits) and no viral or eukaryotic hits were identified as likely contaminants and removed. \n\nThe assemblies of the DC and CA bins were compared by aligning the contigs with nucmer (part of MUMmer3.23 [ ]), using an in-house script for visualization (see   for more details). \n\n\n### Assessment of NCLDV diversity. \n  \nEnvironmental sequences, downloaded in March 2017 from Tara Oceans ( ) ( ) and from EarthVirome ( ) ( ), were combined with the metagenomic sequences from Loki\u2019s Castle (see Table S1 in  ) and screened for sequences related to the Loki\u2019s Castle NCLDVs using BLASTP searches with the bin DNAP sequences as queries. The BLASTP hits were filtered according to E value (maximum, 1e ), high-scoring segment pair (HSP) length (at least 50% of the query length), and identity above 30%. The sequences were extracted using blastdbcmd, followed by alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction performed as described above ( ). \n\n\n### Sequence annotation and phylogenetic analysis. \n  \nThe sequences of the selected bins were translated with MetaGeneMark ( ). tRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE online ( ). Predicted proteins were annotated using their best hits to the NCVOG, cdd, and   nr   databases. In addition, pithovirus-, marseillevirus-, and iridovirus-related bins were annotated using protein clusters constructed as described below. Reference sequences were collected from corresponding NCVOG and cdd profiles, and from GenBank, using BLASTP searches initiated using the Loki\u2019s Castle NCLDV proteins. Reference sequences for Loki\u2019s Castle virophages were retrieved by BLAST and tBLASTn searches against genomic (nr) and metagenomic (environmental whole-genome sequence [wgs]) parts of GenBank, with the predicted Loki\u2019s Castle virophage MCP as queries. The retrieved environmental virophage genome fragments were translated with MetaGeneMark. Homologous sequences were aligned using MUSCLE ( ). For phylogenetic reconstruction, gapped columns (more than 30% gaps) and columns with low information content were removed from the alignments ( ); the filtered alignments were used for tree reconstructions using FastTree ( ). The alignments of three conserved NCLDV proteins were concatenated and used for phylogenetic analysis with PhyML ( ) ( ) The best model identified by PhyML was LG +G\u2009+\u2009I+F (LG substitution model, gamma distributed site rates with gamma shape parameter estimated from the alignment; fraction of invariable sites estimated from the alignment; and empirical equilibrium frequencies). \n\n\n### Protein sequence clusters. \n  \nTwo sets of viral proteins, namely, pithovirus-iridovirus-marseillevirusvirus group proteins (PIM clusters;  ) and NCLDV proteins (NCLDV clusters;  ), were used separately to obtain two sets of protein clusters, using an iterative clustering and alignment procedure, organized as follows. \n\n\n### (i) Initial sequence clustering. \n  \nInitially, sequences were clustered using UCLUST ( ) with a similarity threshold of 0.5; clustered sequences were aligned using MUSCLE, and singletons were converted to pseudoalignments consisting of just one sequence. Sites containing more than 67% gaps were temporarily removed from alignments, and the pairwise similarity scores were obtained for clusters using HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances {the   d     = \u2212log[  s    /min(  s    ,  s    )] formula was used to convert scores   s   to distances   d  }, and a unweighted pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) guide tree was produced from a pairwise distance matrix. A progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves was constructed using HHALIGN ( ), resulting in larger clusters. The procedure was repeated iteratively until all sequences with detectable similarity over at least 50% of their lengths were clustered and aligned together. Starting from this set of clusters, several rounds of the following procedures were performed. \n\n\n### (ii) Cluster merging and splitting. \n  \nPSI-BLAST ( ) searches using the cluster alignments to construct Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) were run against the database of cluster consensus sequences. Scores for pairs of clusters were converged to a distance matrix as described above, UPGMA trees were cut using at the threshold depth, and unaligned sequences from the clusters were collected and aligned together. An approximate ML phylogenetic tree was constructed from each of these alignments using FastTree (WAG evolutionary model, gamma-distributed site rates). The tree was split into subtrees to minimize paralogy and maximize species (genome) coverage. Formally, for a subtree containing   k   genes belonging to   m   genomes (  k   \u2265   m  ) in the tree with the total of   n   genomes (  n   \u2265   m  ) genomes, the \u201cautonomy\u201d value was calculated as (  m  /  k  )(  m  /  n  )(  a  /  b  )  (where   a   is the length of the basal branch of the subtree and   b   is the length of the longest internal branch in the entire tree). This approach gives an advantage to subtrees with the maximum representation of genomes and the minimum number of paralogs and that are separated by a long internal branch. In cases in which a subtree with the maximum autonomy value differed from the complete tree, it was pruned from the tree and recorded as a separate cluster, and the remaining tree was analyzed again. \n\n\n### (iii) Cluster cutting and joining. \n  \nResults of PSI-BLAST searches whereby the cluster alignments were used as PSSMS and run against the database of cluster consensus sequences were analyzed for instances where a shorter cluster alignment had a full-length match to a longer cluster containing fewer sequences. This situation triggered cutting the longer alignment into fragments matching the shorter alignment(s). The alignment fragments were then subjected to the merge-and-split procedure described above. If the fragments of the cluster that was cut did not merge into other clusters, the cut was rolled back, and the fragments were joined. \n\n\n### (iv) Cluster mapping and realignment. \n  \nPSI-BLAST searches performed using the cluster alignments as PSSMs were run against the original database. Footprints of cluster hits were collected, assigned to the respective highest-scoring query clusters, and aligned, forming the new set of clusters mirroring the original set. \n\n\n### (v) Postprocessing. \n  \nThe PIM group clusters were manually curated and annotated using the NCVOG, CDD, and HHPRED matches as guides. For the NCLDV clusters, the final round clusters with strong reciprocal PSI-BLAST hits and with compatible phyletic patterns (using the same autonomy value criteria as described above) were combined into clusters of homologs that maximized genome representation and minimized paralogy. The correspondence between the previous version of the NCVOGs and the current clusters was established by running PSI-BLAST with the NCVOG alignments as PSSMs against the database of cluster consensus sequences. \n\n\n### Genome similarity dendrogram. \n  \nBinary phyletic patterns of the NCLDV clusters (where 1 indicates the presence of the given cluster in the given genome) were converted to intergenomic distances using the equation   d     = \u2212log[  N    /(  N N  ) ], where   N   and   N   are the numbers of COGs present in genomes   X   and   Y  , respectively, and   N     is the number of COGs shared by these two genomes. A genome similarity dendrogram was reconstructed from the matrix of pairwise distances using the neighbor-joining method ( ). \n\n\n### Conserved motif search. \n  \nThe sequences from the LCV genomic bins were searched for potential promoters as follows. For every predicted ORF, upstream genome fragments (from 250 nucleotides upstream to 30 nucleotides downstream of the predicted translation start codons) were extracted, short fragments (i.e., those with fewer than 50 nucleotides) were excluded, and the resulting sequence sets were searched for recurring ungapped motifs using MEME software, with the motif width set to 25, 12, or 8 nucleotides ( ). The putative LCV virophage promoter was used as a template to search upstream fragments of LCMiAC01 and LCMiAC02 with the FIMO online tool ( ). The motifs were visualized using the Weblogo tool ( ). \n\n\n### Additional supplemental material. \n  \nMore supplemental material can be found at  . \n\n\n### Data availability. \n  \nThe metagenomic nucleotide sequence bins analyzed in this work are available in GenBank under the accession numbers MK500278-MK500613 (BioProject PRJNA504765). \n\nRaw sequence reads have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive repository under BioProject PRJNA504765.

Data analysis of these increasingly used methods either requires multiple analysis steps, or extensive computational time. We sought to develop a tool for rapid quantification of sequencing peaks from diverse experimental sources and an efficient method to produce coverage tracks for accurate visualization that can be intuitively displayed and interpreted by experimentalists with minimal bioinformatics background. We demonstrate its strength and usability by integrating data from several types of sequencing approaches. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe have developed   BAMscale  , a one-step tool that processes a wide set of sequencing datasets. To demonstrate the usefulness of   BAMscale  , we analyzed multiple sequencing datasets from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data (ChIP-seq), chromatin state change data (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing: ATAC-seq, DNA double-strand break mapping sequencing: END-seq), DNA replication data (Okazaki fragments sequencing: OK-seq, nascent-strand sequencing: NS-seq, single-cell replication timing sequencing: scRepli-seq) and RNA-seq data. The outputs consist of raw and normalized peak scores (multiple normalizations) in text format and scaled bigWig coverage tracks that are directly accessible to data visualization programs.   BAMScale   also includes a visualization module facilitating direct, on-demand quantitative peak comparisons that can be used by experimentalists. Our tool can effectively analyze large sequencing datasets (~\u2009100\u00a0Gb size) in minutes, outperforming currently available tools. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \n BAMscale   accurately quantifies and normalizes identified peaks directly from BAM files, and creates coverage tracks for visualization in genome browsers. BAMScale can be implemented for a wide set of methods for calculating coverage tracks, including ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, as well as methods that currently require specialized, separate tools for analyses, such as splice-aware RNA-seq, END-seq and OK-seq for which no dedicated software is available. BAMscale is freely available on github ( ). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nImproved technologies and decreasing sequencing costs enable in-depth analyses of chromatin and gene expression changes for genome-wide comparisons. These integrative multi-omics studies elucidate the functionalities of coding and non-coding parts of the genome, their influence on development of complex disease such as cancers [ \u2013 ] and their translational implications [ \u2013 ]. \n\nCurrently many studies focus on identifying protein\u2013DNA interactions through sequencing (ChIP-seq) [ ,  ]. By mapping protein-bound DNA, we can determine transcription factor binding sites or histone modification distributions across the genome. Other analyses focus on identifying open-chromatin and DNA-accessible regions [ \u2013 ], which are useful to classify enhancer regions, and transcription factor footprints [ \u2013 ]. Integrating these analyses with gene expression data such as RNA-seq [ \u2013 ], it is possible to gain better understanding of the architecture and regulation of the genome. \n\nRecently, a new method has been introduced for genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks (END-seq) [ ]. By enabling detection of DNA breaks that occur in a small fraction of a cell population, END-seq can be used to understand how breaks occur and are repaired. \n\nTo understand DNA replication patterns across the genome, next-generation sequencing methods are increasingly used. They are either based on sequencing newly synthesized and RNA-primed DNA, such as Okazaki fragment sequencing (OK-seq) [ ] for the lagging strand or nascent-strand sequencing (NS-seq) for the leading strand [ ]. These approaches are useful to pinpoint where DNA replication is initiated in the genome. The order of genome replication can also be measured with replication-timing sequencing, which involves identifying copy-number state differences between diploid G1-phase and replicating S-phase (or asynchronous\u2014AS) cells [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAlthough sequencing methods are routinely used, data analyses need constant improvement to reduce the number of steps prone to error. In many cases, results are difficult to accurately reproduce because they are obtained with \u201cin-house\u201d scripts. One such example is the quantification of ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq peaks followed by normalization. Another example is generating sequencing coverage tracks [ \u2013 ], which requires either more computation time for scaling and/or multiple steps to get accurate results. Additionally, many sequencing types do not have dedicated solutions for creating coverage tracks for accurate visualization. One example is OK-seq, where replication fork directionality (RFD) is used to identify replication origins in the genome. RFD is calculated from the ratio of reads aligning on the forward and reverse strand, which is usually accomplished by calculations involving multiple steps. Another example is splice-aware RNA-seq, for which the coverage tracks can be calculated using multiple tools, but many of them disregard exon\u2013intron boundaries are disregarded, yielding inaccurate representations of splicing events. \n\nHere, we introduce   BAMscale   (summarized in Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ), a new genomic software tool for generating normalized peak coverages and scaled sequencing coverage tracks in bigWig format.   BAMscale   is a one-step tool that processes DNA sequencing datasets to create scaled and normalized quantifications and coverage tracks. As summarized in Table\u00a0 ,   BAMscale   can process sequencing data generated by diverse experimental approaches, including chromatin binding (ChIP-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), stranded and unstranded RNA-seq, DNA replication assays (OK-seq, NS-seq and replication timing) and DNA double-strand breaks sequencing (END-seq). We developed   BAMscale   in C-programming language using the   samtools   library [ ] and   libBigWig   [ ], achieving superior performance compared to existing tools.   BAMscale   can process 100\u00a0GB of aligned data (in BAM format) in under 20\u00a0min using a regular computer with 4 processing threads. To demonstrate the potential of   BAMscale  , we processed a wide set of sequencing datasets (Additional file  : Table S1), benchmarking the performance with existing tools, paired with post-analyses. The tool, with installation and extensive usage examples, is available at  .   \nApplication and benchmarking of   BAMscale   on different sequencing datasets.   a   Scaled coverage track generation and peak quantification of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data.

BAMScale   modules are available for processing data from BAM files generated by standard chromatin analyses such as ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments and contains additional custom functions to process sequencing data from RNA-seq (rna, stranded or unstranded\u2014Fig.\u00a0 b), OK-seq (rfd, Fig.\u00a0 c), replication timing analyses (reptime, Fig.\u00a0 d) and DNA break mapping (endseq(r), Fig.\u00a0 e). These modules allow direct quantification of peaks from various experimental sources, which are often tested for colocalization in chromatin analyses, using a single, uniform tool. \n\n### Peak quantification and scaling coverage track from ATAC-seq data \n  \nTo test the capabilities of   BAMScale  , we first implemented it to compare chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq data in SLFN11-proficient and deficient cells [ ]. While the performance of   BAMscale   for peak quantification was comparable to the most commonly used   BEDTools   [ ] program with a single processing thread (Additional file  : Fig. S1A),   BAMscale   reduced execution time by\u2009~\u200950% when using four threads (Fig.\u00a0 a). Minor reductions of execution time were observed using 8 threads (Additional file  : Fig. S1A). Notably,   BEDTools   only calculates raw read counts, whereas   BAMscale   performs normalization of raw read counts while outputting FPKM, TPM and library size normalized peak scores. This enables a direct comparison of peaks between samples from cells with different genomic backgrounds undergoing diverse treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 b and Additional file  : Fig. S1B (each point represents one peak), correlations of raw read counts from the two methods were above 0.99 (Fig.\u00a0 b and Additional file  : Fig.S1B), resulting in high density of points on the diagonal that give the appearance of a straight line. Out of the 32,819 quantified peaks, only a single ATAC-seq peak had low read counts from   BAMscale   and high read counts from   BEDTools  . That peak was covered predominantly by reads where the read-pair mapped to a different chromosome (Additional file  : Fig. S1C) that were removed by default by   BAMscale  . The mean execution time to create sequencing coverage tracks with   BAMscale   was 4.6-fold faster than   deepTools bamCoverage   and 1.8-fold faster than   IGVtools   (which does not scale for library size). We have also attempted to compare execution times for this task with the   MACS2   program, which is able to create bedgraph formatted coverage tracks that need to be converted to bigwig format (Table\u00a0 ). The pileup function of   MACS2   achieved similar run-times as   BAMscale  , but did not scale the coverage, whereas the callpeak function scaled coverages with slower run-times (3.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009slower) due to concomitant peak calling (Fig.\u00a0 c).   \nBenchmarking   BAMscale   on ATAC-seq data.   a   Performance comparison of peak quantification and   b   correlation of raw read counts in\u2009~\u200933\u00a0k peaks between   BAMscale   and bedtools.   c   Coverage tracks generation benchmarks using   IGVtools   (unscaled output),   MACS2   (pileup: unscaled, callpeak: scaled with peak calling), deeptools and   BAMscale   (scaled output).   d   ATAC-seq signal change induced from camptothecin (CPT) is observed in wild-type CEM-CCRF cells (SLFN11 positive), and not in the SLFN11 isogenic knockout.   e   Colocalization of opening ATAC-seq peaks using GIGGLE and Cistrome.   f   Examples of chromatin accessibility in the TOP1 and CTCF genes \n  \n\nWe next compared the effect of the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) on ATAC-seq patterns in human leukemia CCRF-CEM (SLFN11-positive) cells and their isogenic SFLN11-knockout [ ]. After CPT treatment, chromatin accessibility remained unchanged in the   SLFN11  -KO cells, while accessibility of pre-existing sites strongly increased in the   SLFN11  -positive cells (Fig.\u00a0 d). Using the   GIGGLE   tool [ ] on the   Cistrome   [ ] website, we found that ATAC-seq peaks strongly overlapped with H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac sites, which are histone marks associated with active genes (Fig.\u00a0 e). Colocalization analysis of sites with\u2009>\u2009threefold increase during CPT treatment in   SLFN11  -positive cells showed\u2009~\u200920% increase in overlap with H3K4me3 and H3K9ac sites, identified using   Coloweb   [ ] (Additional file  : Table S2, Additional file  : Fig. S2). DNA accessibility sites were strongly enriched in gene promoter regions, such as in the   TOP1   and   CTCF   gene promoters (Fig.\u00a0 f). \n\n BAMscale   is designed to quantify ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq peaks from BAM and BED files, producing raw read counts, as well as TPM, FPKM and library size normalized peak scores (Fig.\u00a0 a). By providing accurate peak quantification in parallel with generated scaled coverage tracks,   BAMscale   simplifies the comparison and visualization of genome-wide and local changes. To illustrate this point, we reanalyzed published histone ChIP-seq data from MV4-11 cell line and their isogenic counterpart (MV4-11R) resistant to PKC412, a multi-target protein kinase inhibitor [ ]. Using the   BAMscale   \u201ccov\u201d and \u201cscale\u201d functions, we accurately quantified peak strengths, and created scaled coverage tracks ready for visualization. In agreement with published results, we observed a global increase of H3K27ac, a decrease in H3K27me3 and a largely unchanged H3K4me3 signal in the drug-resistant cells (Fig.\u00a0 a, Additional file  : Fig. S3A-C). Drug-resistant cells displayed elevated protein expression of HOXB7 [ ], which has increased histone H3K27ac signal, a known marker for active genes. \n\n\n### RNA-seq data coverage track generation \n  \nRNA-seq involves sequencing of mature RNA, where introns are spliced-out of the molecules. For this reason, genome alignment of RNA-seq is performed with splice-aware aligners such as STAR [ ] or HISAT2 [ ]. These tools are able to split sequencing reads between two (or more) exons with or without prior gene annotations. Currently most tools that generate coverage tracks (in bigWig or tdf format) are capable of identifying splicing events in the alignments, but their binning process creates inaccurate representations. This causes strong coverage drops in bins that overlap exon\u2013intron boundaries. For this reason, we implemented an RNA-seq-compatible function for   BAMscale   (  Fig.\u00a0 b). Compared to the standard run, in RNA-seq mode   BAMscale   searches for sudden changes in coverages between adjacent bases in a bin (usually\u2009>=5 reads), where resolution changes from bin to a single base pair (illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 a). A major advantage of this method is that no gene/transcript annotation is needed for accurate representation of recurrent splicing events. Output coverages can be set to be unstranded (\u201crna\u201d operation) or stranded (operation set to \u201cstranded\u201d or \u201cstranded\u201d), where two separate bigWig files are created for the two strands (Additional file  : Fig. S4).   \nRe-analysis of RNA-seq data.   a   Overview of   BAMscale   RNA-seq mode. Coverage resolution is switched to single-base resolution in bins where adjacent base coverages exceed 4 reads.   b   Comparison of coverage tracks between   IGVTools  ,   Deeptools   and   BAMscale  .   c   Performance comparison of three tools.   d   Differentially expressed genes between Top1mt wild-type and knock-out mice.   e   Comparison of unscaled and scaled coverages \n  \n\nTo test the potential of   BAMscale   RNA-seq mode, we reprocessed previously published RNA-seq data from   Top1mt   wild type and knock-out mice [ ].   BAMscale   is capable of producing more accurate, single-base resolution tracks at exon\u2013intron boundaries, compared to   IGVTools   or   deepTools bamCoverage   (Fig.\u00a0 b). Additionally, the RNA-seq compatible   BAMscale   (using one processing thread) is 2.5-fold faster than   IGVTools  , 7.2-fold and 3.9-fold faster than   deepTools bamCoverage   running on one or four threads, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 c). After differential expression analysis, we identified several genes that are upregulated in the KO samples (Additional file  : Table S3), such as   Insig2  , which was the statistically most significantly, but with a moderate fold-change increase around 2x (Fig.\u00a0 d). This subtle change in expression is somewhat visible in the unscaled tracks, but the variation in the signal is very strong across replicates (Fig.\u00a0 e, upper tracks). This can be overcome by either extracting scaling factors for samples from the differential expression analysis program such as   DESeq  \u00a0  2   (Fig.\u00a0 e, lower tracks), or by using the genome-size scaling, which scales to the number of sequenced bases. These methods ensure more comparable results for visualization by reducing the variations due to sequencing library size differences. \n\n\n### Alignment of DNA-breakage sites and replication origins with replication timing domains \n  \n BAMScale   expands the range of data type that can be quantitatively scaled and analyzed to include OK-seq, replication timing and splice-aware RNA-seq analyses in addition to ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq, which can be analyzed by other tools as well (see Table\u00a0  for a detailed comparison of data types and analysis tools). To test these capabilities, we processed replication timing, OK-seq and END-seq data derived from activated mouse B cells [ ], where the coverage tracks for the three datasets were created with   BAMscale.  \n\nReplication timing sequencing calculates the order of genome replication. This usually involves the comparison of sequencing depths between G1-phase and S-phase cells. Replication timing log2 coverages of two BAM files can be calculated with   BAMscale   by setting the \u201creptime\u201d flag as the operation. In this process,   BAMscale   first calculates the bin-level coverage of the genome for both BAM files, followed by separate signal smoothening. By default, the bin size is set to 100\u00a0bp, while the smoothening is set to 500 bins. After smoothening the coverage of the two input files, the log2 coverage is calculated and exported to a bigWig file for visualization. \n\nFor OK-seq, the replication fork directionality (RFD) can be calculated with   BAMscale  , for which no other dedicated tools are currently available. When   BAMscale   is set with the \u201crfd\u201d operation, it calculates the bin-level coverage of the genome for reads aligning to the forward strand, and reverse strand separately, followed by RFD calculation of each bin [ ]. In case of mapping of DNA breaks with END-seq, stranded bin-level coverages can be calculated by setting the operation flag to \u201cendseq\u201d (both strands have positive values) or \u201cendseqr\u201d (negative strand coverage will be negative) which allows to overlay the two strand coverages in one figure. \n\nVisual comparison showed high similarly with the deposited tracks (Additional file  : Fig. S5). As previously reported, END-seq DNA-break signals were predominantly observed in early replicating regions of the genome (Fig.\u00a0 a). Genome regions with stronger END-seq signal displayed a higher replication timing average calculated from the log  tracks compared to randomly selected regions (Fig.\u00a0 b). Comparison of negative to positive strand switching in the replication initiation zones identified by OK-seq showed strong overlaps among regions with increased END-seq signal (Fig.\u00a0 c).   \nComparison of replication timing and DNA-breaks.   a   Visualization of DNA-replication timing, synchronized replication origins (OK-seq) and DNA-breaks mapped with END-seq on chromosome 7.   b   Mean replication timing distributions of genomic regions enriched with END-seq signal compared to random peaks.   c   Elevated END-seq regions overlap early replicating regions \n  \n\nFinally, we compared replication timing data to OK-seq and NS-seq (Nascent strand sequencing) data from the human leukemia K562 cell line. Replication timing results (Fig.\u00a0 a(i)) and the generated segments (Fig.\u00a0 a(ii)) showed that early-replicating regions strongly correlate with active chromatin regions (Fig.\u00a0 a(iii)) identified with   ChromHMM   [ ,  ]. Furthermore,   BAMscale   also showed a strong overlap of OK-seq [ ]. RFD strand switches (associated with synchronized replication initiation zones) with active euchromatin (Fig.\u00a0 a(iv, v)). Fewer than 0.5% of identified OK-seq strand switches were identified in heterochromatin, where no overlap with active chromatin regions was found. Similarly, we observed higher NS-seq signal (and replication origin peaks) in euchromatin (Fig.\u00a0 a(vi). Early-replicating regions tend to be associated with more replication initiation sites, which gradually decrease in later phases of replication timing (Fig.\u00a0 b). These results correlate strongly with the NS-seq results showing that early replicating regions have higher peak densities compared to late-replicating regions [ ] (Fig.\u00a0 b). We also tested   BAMscale   on 80 single-cell replication timing sequencing (scRepli-seq) samples [ ]. We were able to accurately reproduce the single-cell log2 replication timing profiles from G1 phase and mid-S phase cells (Additional file  : Fig. S6), requiring on average 11\u00a0s of processing time for each sample pair using 4 processing threads. Furthermore, we compared the performance of   BAMscale   and   deepTools bamCompare   on the replication timing data derived from the human leukemia K562 cell line using eight processing threads. The sequencing data consists of\u2009>\u2009103\u00a0Gb of sequencing data in BAM format, which we re-analyzed six times. The mean run time of   BAMscale   was 23.2\u00a0min, which is a 5.3-fold decrease in analysis time, compared to 123.1\u00a0min required for   deepTools  .   \nComparison of different replication sequencing methods.   a   Replication timing ratios where higher ratios correspond to earlier replicating regions (i), replication timing profile (ii), active/repressed chromatin regions (iii), strong OK-seq strand switch coordinates (iv), OK-seq replication-fork directionality ratios (v) and NS-seq (replication origin) tracks (vi) for K562 cell line.   b   OK-seq strand switches in the four segments of replication.   c   NS-seq peak abundances in the four replication timing phases.   d   Comparison of analysis time between   deeptools bamCompare   and   BAMscale   for replication timing data \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWidespread usage of DNA and RNA capture-based methods helps us understand and categorize changes in chromatin state and their regulatory effects on DNA replication and gene expression. Visualization of genome-wide data is a crucial step to identify complex genomic patterns and relationships. Because of the increased usage of next-generation sequencing both in basic research and clinical settings, it is important to analyze data reproducibly by removing as many analysis steps as possible, as they may be prone to error and be limiting for experimentalists. \n\n BAMscale   addresses two critical prevalent issues that are often encountered in sequencing-based chromatin analyses. First, since the scope of next-generation sequencing is usually genome-wide, the signal distribution of these techniques is generally visualized with different genomic viewers [ ,  ]. However, available tools for sequencing track generation either require multiple steps or need long computation time to produce results ready for visualization [ \u2013 ]. Additionally, quantification and normalization of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peak strengths require multiple analysis steps using time-consuming, case-by-case programming of \u201cin-house\u201d scripts, i.e., time-consuming case-by-case programming. Second, although there are multiple tools to analyze genome-level coverage of sequencing data (e.g.,   IGVTools   [ ],   deepTools   [ ], and   MACS2   [ ] coverage mode coverage mode and   align2rawsignal   [ ]; Table\u00a0 ), many sequencing approaches require specific analysis methods for accurate representations. A simple example is RNA-seq, where the binning process has to be splice-aware for accurate representation of exon\u2013intron boundaries. These are currently not supported by the above-mentioned tools. Another example is OK-seq, which can be used to identify replication origins based on the calculation of replication fork directionality (RFD), for which no dedicated software is available.   BAMscale   provides a uniform, single-step scaling function for these diverse data types, including easy-to-use custom scripts that facilitate quantification and analyses. The additional post-analysis and visualization scripts of BAMscale allow experimentalists to compare, quantify and analyze data from a variety of experimental approaches, aiding in the integration of epigenetic studies. \n\nWe developed   BAMscale   to analyze data in a quick, simple and reproducible manner. It is developed in basic C-programming, resulting in very fast execution times compared to previous methods. To facilitate data analysis, we implemented multiple pre-defined settings for a wide set of sequencing types accompanied with extensive tutorials (  wiki page). \n\nUsing   BAMscale   as a peak quantification method and a scaled coverage-track generation tool, users can identify single focal changes in the genome as well as understand how certain conditions alter global chromatin. We have also implemented an RNA-seq-compatible version enabling accurate visualization of exon\u2013intron boundaries from both stranded and un-stranded data. Notably,   BAMscale   eliminates the need to perform and convert outputs from multiple analyses tools to quantify and visualize data measuring chromatin modifications (ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq), transcription (splice-aware RNA-seq), DNA breakage (END-Seq) and replication (OK-seq, replication timing, NS-Seq). This capability facilitates the analyses of the effects of perturbation on those concomitant chromatin transactions and provides a methodological basis to address important issues such as the coordination of DNA replication and transcription or the orchestration of DNA damage repair with histone modifications. Integration of these multiple analyses would also enable the stratification and identification of genomic regions of interest displaying alterations in one or multiple epigenetic properties. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \n BAMscale   is a tool that can be used to accurately quantify and normalize identified peaks directly from BAM files, as well as create coverage tracks for visualization in genome browsers. The uniform scaling function and the peak-size comparison visualization tool allow easy interpretation of data from various sequencing approaches by experimentalists, and the availability of custom scripts facilitate the integration of distinct chromatin interactions interrogated with diverse methodologies. Due to the multithreaded implementation, our tool outperforms currently used methods. We implemented sequencing-specific coverage track calculation modes including: (1) replication timing, (2) replication fork directionality analysis from OK-seq data, (3) strand-specific coverage of DNA breaks from END-seq and (4) splice-aware RNA-seq coverage modes, many of which lack any dedicated software.   BAMscale   is freely available on github ( ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### BAMscale algorithm \n  \n#### Peak quantification \n  \nPeaks can be quantified with   BAMscale  \u2019s   cov   function, which takes as input a BED file with peak coordinates, and one or multiple BAM files, outputting raw read counts, FPKM, TPM and library size normalized peak scores. Paired-end reads can be quantified in two main ways: (1) using each read as a single entity, or (2) counting read pairs as one fragment. Additionally, it is possible to count reads that follow either the strand direction of each peak in the BED file, or simply calculate forward or reverse reads only. \n\nDuring peak quantification,   BAMscale   by default first reads the entire BAM file(s) to count the number of aligned reads using the selected alignment filters to get the effective library size. This approach gives more accurate alignment statistics than using the BAM index file, which has information on number of aligned reads only, containing duplicate reads and low-quality reads as well. After calculating the effective library size,   BAMscale   counts the number of overlapping reads with each coordinate in the BAM file, followed by FPKM [ ], TPM [ ] and library size (scaled to the smallest library) normalization. \n\nTo facilitate pairwise comparisons (as seen in Fig.\u00a0 d), we prepared an interactive R script (available at  ) using the shiny, ggplot2, tidyr, ggrepel and gridExtra libraries to plot density dot-plots of the quantified (TPM, FPKM and library size normalized) peaks outputted from   BAMscale  . \n\n\n#### Creating coverage tracks from sequencing data \n  \nTo generate normalized coverage tracks, the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function first imports the coverage of every bin (changeable) of the genome, followed by either genome size scaling (based on the length of the genome), or read count scaling. During genome size scaling, the scaling factor is calculated by dividing the total number of aligned bases with the genome size, which is obtained from the header of the BAM file. In cases where the number of bases exceeds the genome size, scaling will reduce the per-bin coverage, while increasing the coverage when the sequenced bases are less than the genome size. The advantage of this approach is that each sample can be scaled separately. Alternatively, it is possible to scale multiple samples based on the library size. In these cases, the number of aligned reads is calculated for each sample, and scaling is done by scaling each sample to the smallest in the set. A drawback of this approach is that all samples have to be processed in parallel, which increases memory requirements (~\u2009500\u00a0Mb for each sample when the bin size is set to 5\u00a0bp). Additionally, it is possible to supply a scaling factor for each sample that will be used to adjust the coverages. \n\nWe implemented an RNA-seq-compatible option for creating coverage tracks with a difference in binning strategy. In RNA-seq mode, at cases where two adjacent bases in one bin have a coverage difference above 4 reads, the resolution is automatically changed to single base resolution. This enables the accurate representation of exon\u2013intron boundaries. \n\nAdditionally, we implemented a signal smoothing option for coverage tracks. When smoothening a signal, the number of adjacent bins can be specified, which will be used to calculate the final signal of each bin. \n\nIn cases where two files are specified, different operations can be performed, such as calculating the log2 ratio of bins, or subtracting the values of bins. \n\nFor ease of use, we implemented predetermined settings to analyze replication timing data and END-seq data. In case of the \u201creptime\u201d operation, the log2 coverage of two bam files are calculated for 100\u00a0bp bin sizes, with signal smoothening set to 500 bins. In case of END-seq, we can set the operation to \u201cendseq\u201d, which creates stranded coverage tracks, or \u201cendseqr\u201d, which negates the coverage track of the negative strand for ease of visualization. \n\n\n#### OK-seq data and replication fork directionality \n  \nIn case of OK-seq data first the Watson (forward) and Crick (reverse) strand coverages are calculated consecutively. After importing the strand-specific coverages, the replication fork directionality (RFD) is calculated as: where   denotes the Crick read counts,   denotes the Watson read counts for the i-th bin (based on [ ]). \n\n\n\n### Sequenced data \n  \n#### NS-seq and replication timing sequencing of K562 cell lines \n  \nTo produce high coverage sequencing of replication origins for the K562 human bone marrow derived cell line, we performed nascent-strand sequencing and replication timing sequencing available at GEO (GSE131417). \n\n\n#### K562 NS-seq sample preparation \n  \nReplication origins were mapped using the nascent-strand sequencing and abundance assay [ ]. Briefly, DNA fractionation was performed using a 5-30% sucrose gradient to collect DNA fractions ranging from 0.5 to 2\u2009kb. Five prime single-strand DNA ends were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4PK) (NEB, M0201S). After phenol/chloroform treatment to remove T4 PK, DNA was precipitated, resuspended and then treated with lambda-exonuclease (NEB, M0262S) to remove genomic DNA fragments that lacked the phosphorylated RNA primer. After RNase treatment and DNA purification (Qiagen PCR purification kit, 28004), single-stranded nascent strands were random-primed using the Klenow and DNA Prime Labeling System (Invitrogen, 18187013). Double-stranded nascent DNA (1\u2009\u03bcg) was sequenced using the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). \n\n\n#### K562 replication timing sample preparation \n  \nTo get the pure G1 phase cells, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 K562 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fractionated by elutriation at each of the following flow speeds: 15\u2009\u00d7\u20092, 16\u2009\u00d7\u20092, 17\u2009\u00d7\u20092, 18\u2009\u00d7\u20092 19\u2009\u00d7\u20092, 20\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0ml/min. Each fraction was stained by DAPI in PBS and confirmed by FACS. Genomic DNA from G1 phase and asynchronized K562 cells was extracted simultaneously according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen, 69506). \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nWe demonstrate the capabilities of   BAMscale   on a wide set of sequencing datasets, such as ATAC-seq [ ], ChIP-seq [ ], replication timing data and END-seq [ ], OK-seq [ ,  ], single-cell Repli-seq and BrdU-IP [ ] and stranded RNA-seq [ ]. The complete list of analyzed samples, genome version and tissues of origins used in this study are shown in Additional file  : Table S1. \n\n#### Alignment of sequencing data \n  \nThe next-generation sequencing data GEO/ENA and SRA ids, along with sample type, aligner (and version) and genome build summarizing 27 processed sequencing experiments can be found in Additional file  : Table S1. ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, OK-seq, END-seq and NS-seq were aligned with the   bwa mem   aligner [ ] (version 0.7.17) or   dragen   pipeline [ ] in case of the K562 replication timing. RNA-seq data were aligned using the   STAR   aligner [ ] two-pass mode. Alignment settings were based on \u201cbest recall at base and read level\u201d as shown in supplementary Table\u00a037 of [ ] to obtain the best alignments. Aligned (unsorted) reads were sorted using   samtools   [ ] (version 1.8), followed by duplicate marking using picard-tools (version 2.9.2). \n\n\n#### Peak calling and coverage track generation for ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and NS-seq \n  \nPeaks were identified using MACS [ ] peak caller (version 2.1.1.20160309), using the nomodel setting for ATAC-seq and NS-seq, and FDR set to 0.01 to filter low-quality peaks. ATAC-seq peaks were called using the narrow setting, while histone peaks were called using the broad peak setting of   MACS  . In case of NS-seq data, both broad and narrow peaks were called, the top 10% of narrow peaks were intersected with the broad peaks to retrieve the highest scoring regions. Called peaks for each cell line and condition were sorted and merged using   BEDTools   [ ] (version 2.27.1). Peak quantification was performed with the \u201ccov\u201d function of   BAMscale   separately for each sequencing type. \n\n\n#### Gene expression quantification and differential expression analysis from RNA-seq data \n  \nRaw read counts for each gene were calculated using the   TPMcalculator   program [ ]. Differential expression analysis between wild-type and KO samples were calculated using   DESeq  \u00a0  2   [ ], where, as suggested in the manual, genes with less than ten reads on average were removed from the analysis. Scaling factors for each sample were obtained using   DESeq  \u00a0  2 sizeFactors()   function. Scaled coverages were created with   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function with operation set to \u201cstrandrnaR\u201d and bin size set to 15 bases, scaling set to \u201c-k custom\u201d and scaling factor set to the reciprocal estimated factors from DESeq\u00a02 for each sample. \n\n\n#### OK-seq data \n  \nBigWig signal of aligned OK-seq reads were created with the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function, with the operation set to \u201crfd\u201d (replication fork directionality), all other parameters were set to default. \n\n\n#### END-seq data \n  \nThe strand-specific coverage tracks for END-seq data were created the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function, with the operation set to \u201cendseqr\u201d. Two coverage tracks are created, one with the forward strand, and a separate track for negative strand reads, where the score is negated. \n\n\n#### Replication timing data \n  \nReplication timing log2 ratio coverage tracks were created with the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function, with the operation set to \u201creptime\u201d. The first specified BAM file is the G1-phase-specific sequencing data, the second BAM file was the asynchronous cell-cycle BAM file. Replication-timing segments were identified the \u201cReplication_timing_segmenter.R\u201d script developed in R, and deposited on github along the BAMscale code. \n\n\n#### Single-cell (sc) Repli-seq \n  \nReplication timing log2 ratio coverage tracks for single-cell replication timing data [ ] were created with the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function. The operation parameter was set to log2, and to reproduce the original analysis results, we set the bin size was set to 50\u00a0kb, and signal smoothening to 4 (resulting in 400\u00a0kb smoothening). In case of the standard CBA/MsM samples the \u201cCBMS1_ESC_single_G1_01\u201d (GSM2904978) sample was used as the G1 phase reference, and sample \u201cCBMS1_Day7Diff_ESC_single_G1_01\u201d (GSM2905031) was used as the G1 phase reference for the 7-day differentiated CBA/MsM samples. \n\n\n#### BrdU-IP replication timing data \n  \nThe log2 coverage of early and late S-phase BrdU-IP sequencing was calculated using the   BAMscale   \u201cscale\u201d function.

Vaccine immunogen designs based on both conserved epitopes are candidates to elicit pan-coronavirus protective immune responses \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus to enter the human population since 2002 and is responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic ( ;  ). While over \u223c1 billion vaccines have been administered as of today ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ), the pandemic remains uncontrolled in many countries and new variants, including the B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2 \u03b1), B.1.351 (\u03b2), P.1 (\u03b3), and B.1.617.2 (\u03b4), are outcompeting previous variants due\u00a0to higher transmissibility and elevated immune evasion ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ). The spike glycoprotein (S) on the surface of the virus mediates entry into cells and is a prominent target for the host immune response including neutralizing antibodies. Consequently, S is a main immunogen for vaccine design. The Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines are all based on S immunogens ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). S consists of a trimer of S1/S2 heterodimers. S1 contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ( ;  ;  ). S2 possesses the fusion machinery, which can mediate host-viral membrane fusion after S1 shedding. Structural insights into the S glycoprotein have been gained by single particle cryo electron microscopy (SP cryoEM) of a soluble trimer comprising most of the ectodomain ( ;  ), as well as by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and SP cryoEM of native virus particles ( ;  ;  ). These studies have revealed several distinct prefusion conformations, wherein three RBD adopt up or down orientations. Receptor ACE2 binds and stabilizes RBD in the up conformation ( ;  ;  ;  ). Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging of single S molecules on the surface of virus particles has provided real-time information for transitions between both RBD-up and -down conformations through one necessary intermediate ( ). \n\nAntibodies isolated from convalescent patients, vaccinated individuals, and previous work on the related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses can be classified by their specificity for three main epitopes: the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD), and the S2 subunit ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For each class, the conformational preferences for either RBD-up or RBD-down trimer configurations have been described. Antibodies directed against the RBD and NTD are often attenuated against emerging variants of concern due to escape mutations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Although immune responses elicited by existing vaccines do offer protection to varying degrees against all known variants of concern ( ;  ), a booster shot to ensure sufficient protection from future emerging variants might be needed. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is the third \u03b2-coronavirus after SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to be transferred to humans in the 21  century, and given the large natural reservoir of similar viruses in species such as bats ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), another pandemic caused by a new coronavirus is likely to happen again. These coronaviruses possess a conserved S2 domain, which raises the possibility of cross-reactive antibodies and cross-reactive vaccines. SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S is approximately 75% homologous to SARS-CoV-1 and 35% to MERS S ( ;  ). Various cross-reactive antibodies have been identified ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Recently isolated antibodies capable of cross-neutralizing human coronaviruses bind to the conserved stem helix region on S2 (residues 1140\u20131165), reviving hopes for pan-coronavirus vaccines ( ;  ;  ). \n\nWe previously characterized two potent S-binding antibodies, CV3-1 and CV3-25, out of 198 antibodies isolated from convalescent patients ( ;  ). CV3-1 targets the RBD of S1 and CV3-25 binds to the S2 ectodomain, the former displaying the most potent neutralizing activity among all antibodies (Abs) isolated. While CV3-1 is specific for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, CV3-25 can recognize the S2 domains derived from several \u03b2-coronaviruses ( ). Both antibodies protected against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models in prophylactic and therapeutic settings ( ). Here, we report the structural basis and mode of action for these two potent antibodies. We deployed cryoET of virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying the S  variant to determine the epitopes of these two antibodies. CV3-1 bound to the tip region (485-GFN-487 loop) within the receptor-binding motif (RBM), as confirmed by mutagenesis. Interestingly, we observed that most Ss in CV3-1-treated VLPs were triggered into the post-fusion conformation of S2 and caused S1 shedding into the supernatant. The data indicate that CV3-1 is a potent agonist and point to the 485-GFN-487 loop as an allosteric center critical for the activation of S1. In contrast, CV3-25 bound the stem helix in the connecting domain (CD) of S2 and blocked membrane fusion. Its binding was asymmetric, as S trimer was bound by 1 or 2 CV3-25 antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Peptide competition narrowed the epitope and permitted the determination of the crystal structure of the S2 stem peptide bound to CV3-25 Fab. The structure revealed a unique bent conformation of the viral peptide with an upstream \u03b1-helical region followed by a random coil. Fitting of the X-ray structure into the cryoET density map demonstrated that an increasing degree of stem helix rotation was required to allow binding of one or both Fabs to avoid steric clashes. Compared with other recently reported S2-helix engaging antibodies (interacting with the helix N terminus, residues 1147\u20131157), CV3-25 interacts with the helix C terminus and the proximate hinge (residues 1153\u20131165). Given that the stem helix epitope is highly conserved among \u03b2-coronaviruses, immunogens featuring this S2 epitope are interesting candidates for vaccines to cover all variants and possibly exhibit pan-coronavirus efficacy. Moreover, since many antibodies that bind S are non-neutralizing, our work suggests that agonist features that prematurely trigger and thereby irreversibly inactivate S, or inhibition of membrane fusion, contribute to the ability of neutralizing antibodies to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### CV3-1 and CV3-25 neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants \n  \nWe first tested the ability of CV3-1 and CV3-25 to recognize and neutralize the emerging variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2 \u03b1), B.1.351 (\u03b2), P.1 (\u03b3), B.1.617.2 (\u03b4) as well as variants of interest B.1.429 (\u03b5), B.1.525 (\u03b7), B.1.526 (\u03b9), and B.1.617.1 (\u03ba). CV3-1 efficiently bound to cells expressing S glycoproteins from these different SARS-CoV-2 variants or carrying their individual mutations ( A and  A). Despite the presence of variant-specific mutations in RBD, CV3-1 retained potent neutralizing activity (IC  0.004\u20130.014\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) ( \nB). Of note, CV3-1 binding to the B.1.1.7 variant with and without the additional E484K substitution was higher than binding to the S from the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (WT). CV3-25 was less potent with an IC  in the range of \u223c0.05\u20130.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, but remained effective against all variants in both binding ability and neutralization ( A, 1B, and  B). Both CV3-1 IgG and the CV3-25 IgG GASDALIE mutant, which binds more strongly to Fc\u03b3 receptors, also protected   in\u00a0vivo   against both the B.1.1.7 (\u03b1) ( ) and B.1.351 (\u03b2) variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the K18-hACE2 prophylactic mouse model ( C\u20131E). Both antibodies limited viral replication in the nose and lungs as well as its dissemination to the brain, thereby reducing the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( C\u2013S1F). These data demonstrate that in contrast to other antibodies that are attenuated against emerging variants ( ;  ;  ;  ), CV3-1 and CV3-25 remain potent against these variants and are therefore prime candidates to elucidate the mode of action and identify epitopes with pan-coronavirus activity.   \nCV3-1 and CV3-25 neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants \n\n(A) Cell-surface staining of 293T cells expressing full-length S from indicated variants by CV3-1 (left panel) and CV3-25 (right panel) monoclonal Abs (mAbs).

We had previously established that these states correspond to the RBD-down (\u223c0.5 FRET) and RBD-up (\u223c0.1 FRET), a necessary structural intermediate (\u223c0.3 FRET) in the transition from RBD-down to RBD-up that is likely observed in a protomer adjacent to an RBD-up, and a high-FRET state (\u223c0.8) for which a structure is not available ( ). CV3-1 redistributed the conformational landscape of S to the \u223c0.1 low-FRET state that corresponds to the RBD-up, thus mimicking receptor ACE2. CV3-25 redistributed the conformational landscape toward activation with an increase in the occupancy of the structural intermediate (\u223c0.3 FRET) as well as the RBD-up state (\u223c0.1 FRET) ( A and 2B). Overall, the conformational landscapes of the S  variant and the conformational preferences of CV3-1 and CV3-25 were similar to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain ( ).   \nConformational dynamics of S  bound with CV3-1 and CV3-25 \n\n(A) Conformational states of S  on lentiviral particles monitored by smFRET for unliganded, CV3-1- and CV3-25-bound S .

For parallel comparation with cryoET data, 0.8-FRET portion was omitted, due to its structural uncertainty. \n\n(C and D) Zoomed-in views of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses bearing S bound by CV3-1 (C) and CV3-25 (D) Fabs and representative slices of tomograms (insets).

UP state was separated by focused classification on the RBD region. The remaining of the RBDs were defined as DOWN state if there was no up RBD on the same S; otherwise, they were considered as INTERMIEDATE state. \n\n(F) Proportion of different RBD states of Ss on virions with and without Fabs bound. Ss were grouped into 3-RBD-down, 1-RBD-up, 2-RBD-up, and 3-RBD-up classes. \n\n(G) Side views (top panel) and top views (middle and bottom panels) of subclasses of averaged S bound by CV3-1 Fabs. \n\n(H) Side views (left column) of the consensus structure of unliganded (bottom) and CV3-25 bound (top) S and top views of subclass averages (right columns) obtained after focused classification on the RBD of S.In (G-H), dotted lines indicate the positions of top-view sections. Blue arrowheads point to the gap in density between RBD and the neighboring NTD that appears when the RBD moves into the UP-state. Scale bar, 5 nm. \n\n(I) Segmentation of subclass averages of unliganded (bottom) and CV3-25 bound (top) S. Top views and side views (insets) are shown for 3-RBD-down, 1-RBD-up, 2-RBD-up, and 3-RBD-up classes. Down RBDs and up RBDs are shown in blue and red, respectively; CV3-25 Fabs are shown in orange. \n  \n\nWe next used cryoET to identify the epitope for CV3-1 and CV3-25 and analyze their conformational preference by quantifying the proportion of antibody-bound trimers in the 3-RBD-down, 1-RBD-up, 2-RBD-up, and 3-RBD-up for S  on the surface of lentiviral particles. To improve incorporation of S into lentiviral particles for EM, the S  cytoplasmic tail was truncated ( C and 2D). The unliganded S  displayed a similar number of 3-RBD-down, 1-RBD-up, and 2-RBD-up conformations, with the 3-RBD-up conformation rarely observed ( F). CV3-1 clearly bound to the top of RBD with the RBD being oriented up ( C). Nearly all trimers with bound CV3-1 were in the RBD-up conformation ( E\u20132G). Binding to RBD is consistent with previous data that demonstrated the ability of CV3-1 to competitively inhibit ACE2-S binding   in\u00a0vitro   ( ). \n\nIn contrast, CV3-25 bound toward the bottom of S2 and all trimer configurations were observed ( D, 2F, 2H, and 2I). Compared with the unliganded S, CV3-25 binding redistributed the frequency of trimer configurations from the 3-RBD-down to the 1-, 2-, and 3-RBD-up configurations. To compare cryoET with smFRET data, we calculated the number of conformational states of individual RBD units, which is monitored by smFRET. This was done under the assumption that protomers neighboring to an RBD-up protomer are in an intermediate FRET state ( ). Consequently, the 1- and 2-RBD-up not only feature 1 or 2 additional protomers in the RBD-up conformation, but also likely introduce a significant occupancy for structures exhibiting an intermediate FRET state (\u223c0.3) ( E and 2F). While several caveats remain, such as the use of cytoplasmic tail-deleted S for EM (wt S for smFRET), the inability to see a structure corresponding to the intermediate FRET (\u223c0.3), and as a consequence, not knowing if both, left, and right protomers neighboring an RBD-up, are in an intermediate FRET state, and the inability to assign a structure for the high-FRET state (\u223c0.8), this is the first time that we can generate dynamic and static data for S on virus particles produced in the same cell type and assess them in parallel by smFRET and cryoET. Overall, there is qualitative agreement between cryoET and smFRET about how CV3-1 and CV3-25 alter the conformational landscape of S. Above-mentioned caveats make quantitative comparisons currently impossible. smFRET may detect more dynamic features, while cryoET may emphasize static features as previously discussed for the HIV-1\u00a0glycoprotein ( ). \n\n\n### CV3-1 binds to the 485-GFN-487 loop of RBD \n  \nTo gain a higher resolution structure for CV3-1 bound to S , we imposed C3 symmetry on a subtomogram averaged structure and determined a \u223c12-\u00c5 map ( A and 3B,  A\u2013S3C). The averaged cryoET structure showed three CV3-1 Fabs bound to the apex of the S trimer. Classification among these particles did not identify any subclass of Ss bound with only one or two CV3-1 Fabs ( D). Rigid-body fitting with a 3-RBD-down atomic model of S  (PDB:   [ ]) left all three RBDs outside of cryoET density, while flexible fitting resulted in the conformational change from the RBD-down to the RBD-up state ( C and  ). We applied rigid fitting of the atomic structure of 1-up RBD (PDB:   [ ]) to arrive at a model for CV3-1 Fab bound to S  ( D). Compared with the footprint of receptor ACE2 on RBD (PDB:   [ ]), CV3-1 preferentially bound to the extending loop that contains the G F N  residues ( D and 3E). We performed mutagenesis for the RBM and tested the abilities of CV3-1 and ACE2 to bind S mutants expressed on cells by flow cytometry. In agreement with the structural model, CV3-1 binding was preferentially affected by mutations in the 485-GFN-487 loop ( F and 3G). In contrast, ACE2 binding was sensitive to mutations within the RBM consistent with previous results ( ;  ). Importantly, all mutations within the 485-GFN-487 loop affecting CV3-1 binding also impaired ACE2 binding, indicating that escape mutations at these positions would likely result in a high fitness cost for the virus.   \nCV3-1 binds to the 485-GFN-487 loop of RBD \n\n(A) Side view (top panel) and top views (bottom panel) of subtomogram average of CV3-1-bound S.

The graphs shown represent the MFIs normalized to the MFI obtained with CV3-25 staining of the corresponding mutant. Dashed lines indicate the reference value obtained with S D614G (WT). Error bars indicate means \u00b1 SEM. These results were obtained in at least 4 independent experiments. Statistical significance was tested using one-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak post-test ( p <0.05;  p <0.01;  p <0.001;  p <0.0001). \n\n(H) RBD-based superimposition of CV3-1 and other ridge-binding antibodies. The SAbPred predicted CV3-1 model generated from rigid-body fitting to the CryoET map (semi-transparent surface) is colored in light purple and SAR-CoV-2 RBD in pink. The Fv regions of other ridge-binding Abs are shown as ribbons in indicated colors: IGHV1-58/IGKV3-20 antibodies in green and P2C-1F11 in orange. \n  \n\n\n\nCV3-1 uses IGHV1-58 heavy chain and IGKV3-20 light chain and has low level of somatic hypermutation ( ). Recent studies have identified several neutralizing antibodies targeting the similar ridge region as CV3-1 ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Although produced from different convalescent patients, they share similar gene family usage in their heavy and light chains, IGHV1-58/IGKV3-20, and indicated potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2. These NAbs fit well into CV3-1 cryoET density map with almost same binding angles as CV3-1 ( H), suggesting this is a common class of NAbs that utilizes IGHV1-58/IGKV3-20 immunoglobulin genes and targets the RBD ridge region of SARS-CoV-2 S. \n\n\n### CV3-1 is a potent agonist triggering S1 shedding \n  \nSARS-CoV-2\u00a0S glycoproteins lacking the cytoplasmic tail are efficiently incorporated into lentiviral particles and form a dense array of Ss in the prefusion state ( ;  ;  ;  ). In contrast, the virus particles incubated with CV3-1 lost most prefusion Ss and displayed S in the post-fusion state ( C). Quantification of S numbers revealed that 83% of prefusion Ss, comparing with unliganded S, were lost after incubation with CV3-1 ( \nA). The structural characterization of CV3-1 bound to S shown above was performed with the remaining \u223c17% of prefusion Ss. Given the loss of S1 and activation of S2 into post-fusion conformation, we hypothesized that, besides competition with ACE2 ( ), triggering S1 shedding likely contributed to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization efficacy of CV3-1. Radioactive labeling followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates and supernatant revealed that incubation with CV3-1 indeed released most S1 into the supernatant, with its activity well exceeding that of ACE2 ( B). S lacking the furin-cleavage site was resistant to CV3-1- and ACE2-mediated shedding. The loss of S1 following incubation of CV3-1 was also observed by flow cytometry on cells expressing S ( C). S lacking the furin-cleavage site was again resistant to shedding induced by CV3-1. In contrast to CV3-1, CV3-25 induced little or no shedding in all assays ( A\u20134D). Importantly, the ability of CV3-1 to neutralize the emerging variants B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2 \u03b1), B.1.351 (\u03b2), P.1 (\u03b3), B.1.526 (\u03b9), B.1.429 (\u03b5), and B.1.617.2 (\u03b4) ( B) paralleled the ability of CV3-1 to shed S1 ( D). These data indicate that RBD-targeting antibodies can be potent agonists by prematurely activating S to impair virus entry, as previously observed for other RBM-directed antibodies ( ;  ;  ).   \nCV3-1 triggers S1 shedding \n\n(A) Statistical table of pre-fusion S selected manually for cryoET analysis. \n\n(B) S1 shedding was evaluated by transfection of 293T cells followed by radiolabeling in presence of CV3-1, CV3-25, or ACE2-Fc and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates and supernatant with CV3-25 and a rabbit antiserum raised against SARS-COV-2 RBD produced in-house.

Statistical significance was tested using a Mann-Whitney U test ( p <0.01;  p <0.001; ns, non-significant). \n\n(D) CV3-1 induced S1 shedding of S from selected emerging variants, measured as in (B). \n  \n\nAs previously shown using SP cryoEM, the S trimer displays significant tilt relatively to the viral membrane because of its highly flexible stalk region ( ;  ;  ). Among the CV3-1-bound S that remained on the surface of virus particles, we sought to observe a change in the tilt angle of CV3-1-bound S. Quantification revealed a profound straightening of the S from an average tilt angle of \u223c57\u00b0 for the unliganded S to only \u223c37\u00b0 ( A\u2013S2C). Apparently, the ACE2\u2013mimicking activation of RBD by CV3-1 leads to long-range structural effects involving S2, likely weakening the S1-S2 interface and resulting in the shedding of S1. When evaluating antibody binding cooperativity, the Hill coefficient for CV3-1 binding was found to be highly positive (h > 2) ( D). Structurally, CV3-1 cannot bind the 3-RBD-down conformation due to a clash between heavy chain and adjacent RBD ridge. The highly positive cooperativity likely reflects a facilitated binding of CV3-1 to the second and third subunits in the RBD-up conformation. Our smFRET data have shown that SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S spontaneously transitions between RBD-down and RBD-up conformation. Thus, conformational capture of an RBD-up conformation by CV3-1 likely mediates the initial binding step. \n\n\n### CV3-25 binds the stem helix of S2 \n  \nWe employed a multipronged approach including cryoEM, cryoET, peptide competition, and X-ray crystallography to gain mechanistic insight into how CV3-25 achieves broad neutralization against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other \u03b2-coronaviruses ( ;  ). We first determined the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S (HexaPro, prefusion-stabilized) ( ) in the presence of CV3-25 Fab at an overall resolution of \u223c3.5\u00a0\u00c5 ( A\u2013S4D). Map density analysis indicated the 1-RBD-up state was the dominant S conformation with a decreased local resolution in this region ( G). The density corresponding to the C-terminal stem region was less defined with a local resolution lower than 7\u00a0\u00c5, but there was additional density for CV3-25 in the C-terminal stem region. 3D classification of the cryo-EM data barely improved the local density, suggesting incomplete Fab saturation for all available binding sites. Nevertheless, the data suggested that CV3-25 binds to the lower stem of the soluble HexaPro S. \n\nGiven that soluble S trimers are truncated, lack the transmembrane region, and feature a T4 foldon, we reasoned that cryoET of native S glycoproteins embedded into virus particles could provide more insight into CV3-25\u2019s epitope. We used cryoET followed by subtomogram averaging of \u223c7,000 prefusion Ss to examine CV3-25 binding to S . Subclassification revealed that about half of S had two CV3-25 Fabs bound to the stem of S2, and the other half had only one CV3-25 Fab bound ( ). We further aligned the subtomograms with a mask for two CV3-25 Fabs to arrive at a \u223c10-\u00c5 resolution map. This structure places the CV3-25 epitope within the CD of the stem helix ( A, 5B, and 5F). Density for the second Fab was weaker, since \u223c half of Ss had only one CV3-25 Fab bound.   \nCV3-25 binds to a conserved epitope in S2 \n\n(A) Side view (top panel) and top views (bottom panel) of subtomogram averaged CV3-25-bound S.

Indirect ELISA was performed using SARS-CoV-2 S2 peptide pools and incubation with the CV3-25 mAb.

CV3-25 binding was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG and was quantified by relative light units (RLUs). Single peptides with significant positive signal were highlighted in red (peptides #288 and #289).

Peptides #288 and #289 location at the CV3-25 binding site are indicated in red. \n  \n\nAs discussed above, classification of the S structures into 3-RBD-down, 1-, 2-, or 3-RBD-up revealed an overall shift toward activation for CV3-25-bound S ( E and 2F). Averaged structures focusing on RBD showed three bound CV3-25 Fabs in 1-RBD-up and 2-RBD-up Ss, while only two CV3-25 Fabs bound to 3-RBD-down and 3-RBD-up average structures ( E). These structures confirmed that CV3-25 binds to all prefusion S configurations, consistent with previous biochemical results as well as smFRET ( ). Any observed asymmetry was not due to the tilt of the S, as the average tilt barely changed upon binding of CV3-25 ( A\u2013S2C), consistent with a neutral antibody binding cooperativity (Hill coefficient \u2248 1) ( D). \n\n\n### Peptide screening maps CV3-25 epitope to the S residues 1149\u20131167 \n  \nTo gain atomic insight, we screened S2 peptides for binding to CV3-25 with the goal of isolating peptides suitable for X-ray crystallography. The first insight that CV3-25 binds a linear peptide was gained from Western blotting following SDS-PAGE. CV3-25 was clearly able to bind to S2 as well as the S2-containing S precursor under fully denaturing conditions and independently of N-linked glycans ( A and S6B). We then tested a set of peptides (15-mer) spanning the entire S2 subunit including the CD and performed two rounds of ELISA to identify peptides capable of binding CV3-25 ( C\u20135E). The identified peptides (#288 and #289) were also tested in competition assays, and the binding was quantified using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays ( C and S6D). Peptide #289 was the most potent in all assays with a K  of 29\u00a0nM and efficiently blocked CV3-25 neutralization ( E and S6F). Peptides #288 and #289 mapped to the S2 stem helix region ( F), consistent with the CV3-25 binding region indicated in the cryoET averaged structure. \n\n\n### CV3-25 binds to a conserved S2 peptide in a bent conformation \n  \nTo obtain molecular insight into CV3-25 interaction with the S2\u00a0stem peptide, we determined the co-crystal structure of CV3-25 Fab with a synthetic peptide spanning residues 1140\u20131165 (26mer) of SARS-CoV-2 S. The structure was solved to 2.1-\u00c5 resolution and allowed us to resolve 20 of the 26 residues in relation to the Fab paratope ( \n,  , and  ). When bound to CV3-25 Fab, the peptide adopted a bent conformation with the N-terminal half of the peptide (residues 1146-DSFKEELDKYFK-1157), forming an \u03b1-helix and the C-terminal half of a random coil (residues 1158-NHTSPDVD-1165) with a bend of \u223c95\u00b0 between the two ( A). This bent conformation fit well with the long complementary determining region (CDR) H3 loop of the Fab (16 residues long) that is stabilized by extensive H-bonds, salt bridges, and intra-molecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between residues Y  and H  of the peptide ( B\u20136D and  ). A rare CDR H3 disulfide bond between residues C  and C  also stabilizes the CDR H3 hairpin that tightly associates with the S2 peptide random coil. Interestingly, the S2 stem region recognized by CV3-25 is conserved among the B lineage of \u03b2-coronaviruses ( F), with several key epitope residues also conserved among A, C, and D lineages. Indeed, CV3-25 is able to recognize the stem helix peptide derived from MERS S ( ). This suggests that CV3-25 displays cross-reactivity with coronaviruses beyond the B-lineage ( ;  ). Furthermore, although crystallographic analyses confirm that residues 1149 to 1165 of the S2 stem to interact with CV3-25 ( D), SPR analyses using S2 peptide truncations indicate that CV3-25 may also interact with residues following D , the terminal S2 residue used in crystallographic studies. These contacts could be mediated by the light chain of CV3-25 that is positioned to accommodate the C-terminal extension of the peptide ( A). Additionally, a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) is present in the CV3-25 epitope (N1158), but the residue is positioned in a way that the glycan protrudes on the opposite side of the stem helix. Removal of the N1158 PNGS using different substitution did not affect CV3-25 binding, which is in line with its glycan independence ( B, S6F, and S6G). Of note, the S2 recognition site and angle of approach of CV3-25 differentiate it from B6, an anti-MERS-CoV cross-reactive S2-binding Nab, as well as two known human NAbs specific for SARS-CoV-2 stem helix, CC40.8 and S2P6 ( ;  ;  ) ( G, PDB of CC40.8 not available to date). B6, CC40.8, and S2P6 mainly interact with the N-terminal stem \u03b1-helix and barely contact with the C-terminal loop, as recognized and reconfigured by CV3-25. Additionally, the antibody class defined by B6, CC40.8, and S2P6 have been shown to bind to the hydrophobic face of the stem helix, while CV3-25 binds to an adjacent face of the stem helix, which involves the important interaction with several charged residues (notably D1153 and K1157) as depicted in  . Mutations of these key residues completely abrogated CV3-25 binding ( F and S6G). This unique binding mode of CV3-25 indicates it as the first representative of a new class of anti-S2 antibodies with broad reactivity against \u03b2-coronaviruses.   \nMolecular details of interaction of CV3-25 with SARS-CoV-2 stem peptide spanning residues 1140\u20131165 of S2 \n\n(A) Crystal structure of CV3-25 Fab in complex with S2  stem peptide (orange) in two orthogonal views. S2 peptide (orange) assumes a bent conformation with the N-terminal \u03b1-helical portion binding primarily to CDRs H1 and H2 (light green and cyan, respectively) and the random coil region interacting with CDR H3 (light pink). A non-canonical disulfide (C -C ) stabilizes the protruding CDR H3 and likely strengthens its interactions with the S2 C-terminus. \n\n(B) Close-up views into the CV3-25 Fab-S2  peptide interface. In the top panel, the electrostatic potential is displayed over the molecular surface of CV3-25 (left) or S2 peptide (right) with 180\u00b0 views of the complex with the putative glycosylation site N1158 marked with a black asterisk. The bottom panel shows the network of H-bonds and salt bridges formed at the interface with orientations of complex as in the top panel. Salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (<3.5 \u00c5) are denoted as yellow and blue dashed lines, respectively. A total of 11 H-bonds and 4 salt bridges are formed at the interface, with D  and K  of the S2 peptide contributing the majority of the hydrophilic contacts. The S2 bend and loop conformation (1158\u20131165) are stabilized by heavy-chain CDR contacts. In addition, \u03c0-proline-\u03c0 sandwich (F - P -Y ) stacking formed between the conserved S2 and CDR H1 further stabilizes the interface. CV3-25 light chain contacts are limited to only a single water-mediated H-bond to the C-terminal D  of S2. \n\n(C) The network of interaction (5-\u00c5 cutoff) between CV3-25 and S2 interface. Salt bridges and H-bonds (bond length less than 3.5 \u00c5) are shown as red dashed and blue solid lines, respectively. Hydrophobic interactions or bond distances between 3.5 and 5.0 \u00c5 are shown as gray dotted lines. \n\n(D) Diagram showing the buried surface area (BSA) of each individual S2 peptide residue in the CV3-25 Fab-S2 peptide complex. The BSA values of individual S2 residues were calculated using PISA  and are shown as the average of the values obtained for two complexes in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. \n\n(E) Sequence alignment of the S glycoprotein stem-peptide regions from representative beta-coronaviruses and two human alpha-coronaviruses. The Fab-peptide interface residues are marked with ( ) and those involved in hydrogen bonds or salt bridges by side chain, main chain, or both are marked with (+), (\u2212), and (\u00b1), respectively. The identical residues as compared with SARS-CoV-2 are colored in red with conservative changes marked in orange and non-conservative changes in black. \n\n(F) SPR sensor grams of three SARS-CoV-2 S2 peptides binding to the immobilized CV3-25 IgG on a Protein A chip. The experimental data (colored) are fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir model (black), and the resulting kinetic constants are as shown. The minimal peptide recognized by CV3-25 with a low K  value (\u223c1 \u03bcM) is 1153\u20131163. A 2- or 4-residue C-terminal extension leads to a 18- to 32-fold increase in the binding affinity. \n\n(G) S2-peptide-based structural superimposition of CV3-25 (blue) and two other S2-binding antibodies, S2P6 (PDB: 7RNJ, pink), and B6 (PDB: 7M53, pale green) in two orthogonal views. SARS-CoV-2 S2 peptide (1147\u20131165) bound to CV3-25 is shown as orange ribbon. \n  \n\nTo conceptualize the X-ray structure of the peptide bound to CV3-25 in the context of the S trimer, we superimposed two CV3-25 Fabs structures to the stem helix of the S trimer (PDB:   [ ] ( \nA). Direct superposition results in a clash of the Fabs and a mismatch of the Fab with the density map observed in the cryoET structure ( A). The random coil of the stem helix bound with CV3-25 points toward the center of the stem helix bundle producing a clash when two coils occupy the center region ( A). By performing flexible fitting, we arrived at a structure for two CV3-25 Fabs bound to the S trimer, in which the helix and flexible turn are almost maintained at the original position for the first Fab (rotated by about 13\u00b0), and are shifted outward and rotated by about 20\u00b0 for the second Fab ( B and  ). The increasing need for dislocation and rotation likely explains that binding additional Fabs comes at an energy cost resulting in an asymmetric arrangement of one or two CV3-25 Fabs bound to S.   \nCV3-25 inhibits S-mediated virus fusion \n\n(A) The crystal structures of the CV3-25 Fabs (purple and yellow) with the S2  peptides (blue) were superimposed onto the stem helix of the prefusion S atomic model (gray, PDB 6XR8) and fitted into the CV3-25 CryoET structure. Left panel: side view indicates that CV3-25 does not dock into the cryoET density map. There are clashes between two Fabs (middle panel, bottom view) and the tails of binding stem helix (right panel, top view). \n\n(B) Flexible fitting with a combined model containing the CV3-25_S2  crystal structure and prefusion S structure (gray, 6XR8) onto the cryoET structure. CV3-25 Fabs (purple and yellow) dock into the cryoET density map (left panel). The torsions of binding stem helix (blue, helix axes in cyan and pink, respectively) after fitting, comparing with original position of stem helix in 6XR8 (gray, helix axes in dark gray), were shown in middle and right panels. The third protomer was omitted for clarity. \n\n(C) Superimposition of peptide-bound CV3-25 (purple, heavy chain; green, light chain) to the fusion S (gray, PDB 6XRA). The peptide (pink) was aligned to the stem helix in the S. The glycan on residue ASN1158 is shown in sphere representation (yellow). Possible clashes are indicated in red circles. \n\n(D and E) Investigation of virus-cell fusion activity in presence and absence of CV-35 mAb by the split nanoluc complementation assay. A scheme of the spilt nanoluc complementation assay experimental design was shown in (C). Error bars indicate means \u00b1 SEM. \n  \n\n\n\nSuperimposition of the CV3-25/peptide structure to post-fusion S (PDB:  ) ( ) indicates that the light chain of CV3-25 would clash with HR1 of the adjacent protomer ( C). Furthermore, in post-fusion conformation, the stem helix unwinds a full turn, resulting in a clash between the glycan at ASN1158 and the heavy chain of CV3-25 ( C). These observations suggest that the structure of CV3-25 bound to S is incompatible with the post-fusion conformation of S. Indeed, we observed potent inhibition of membrane fusion by CV3-25 in a virus-to-cell fusion assay that uses nano-luciferase complementation ( D and 7E). As observed for CV3-1, CV3-25 also exhibits potent inhibitor function. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we describe the structures and mode of action of two potent anti-SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S antibodies. Both antibodies remained effective against emerging variants of concern and therefore were prime candidates to elucidate mode of action and identify epitopes with pan-coronavirus activity. CV3-1 stabilized the RBD in the \u201cRBD-up\u201d conformation and triggered potent shedding of S1. The ability of CV3-1 to neutralize variants of concern correlated with its ability to shed S1 and inactivate S. In contrast, CV3-25 bound to a highly conserved epitope in the stem helix in the S2 subunit and inhibited membrane fusion. We believe that both epitopes of these two antibodies are of interest for passive and active immunization strategies against emerging variants. \n\nThe cryoET structure of CV3-1 to S suggested binding to the 485-GFN-487 loop of RBD, an interpretation confirmed by mutagenesis. While mutations in these positions abrogate the binding of CV3-1 to S, they are rarely observed among circulating strains, suggesting that they are associated with a high fitness cost likely due to their importance in ACE2 interaction, in agreement with previous studies on the role of SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S mutations on ACE2 binding ( ;  ). Interestingly, CV3-1 exhibited potent agonist features indicating that it hits an allosteric site that is critical for the ability of ACE2 to induce conformational changes that lead to fusion. Consistent with this observation, CV3-1 induced potent shedding and the straightening of Ss indicative of allosteric signaling from the RBD all the way to the S2 stem region. This allosteric signaling likely weakens the S1-S2 interface leading to the observed shedding of S1. While CV3-1 is specific against SARS-CoV-2, it remained active against all tested variants of concern and variants of interest and protected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal challenges using the B.1.351 variant of concern. The potent agonist features within the ACE2 binding site may also open an opportunity for small-molecule inhibitors that prematurely activate S not unlike CD4 mimetics in the case of HIV-1 envelope ( ). \n\nCV3-1 belongs to a class of RBD-specific antibodies that use IGHV1-58 and IGKV3-20 immunoglobulin variable precursor genes, approaching the RBD ridge region with a certain angle ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) ( H). Whether these IGHV1-58/IGKV3-20 Nabs similarly trigger S1 shedding requires further investigation. Interestingly, P2C-1F11 had been reported as a potent inducer for S1-shedding by binding at the tip region of RBD ( ). When P2C-1F11 was superimposed with the cryoET-map-fitted CV3-1 based on the bound RBD, it revealed that P2C-1F11 interacts with both the ridge and the RBM from a different orientation ( H), indicating that the molecular mechanism of shedding requires further studies. Clearly, antibodies that target the tip region of RBD do not always shed, and shedding can be triggered by binding to other regions of RBD ( ;  ;  ). A full understanding of how RBD-targeting antibodies trigger S1 activation and shedding likely requires a molecular understanding how S1 evolved to be activated by receptor. \n\nThe structures of CV3-25 with an S peptide and intact S on the surface of virus particles revealed that it binds to the S2 stem in a region conserved among \u03b2-coronaviruses. At the time of our manuscript preparation, the structure of the CV3-25-S2 peptide (residues 1149\u20131167) complex was solved by  , at similar resolution. The structures are virtually the same, with identical conformation of the S2 peptide bound to CV3-25. Unlike other recently reported anti-S2 antibodies, CC40.8 and S2P6, which mainly recognize the stem helix (residues 1147\u20131157) and barely interact with the hinge region ( ;  ), CV3-25 also engages the hinge peptide known to be responsible for the tilting of Ss with respect to the membrane (residues 1153\u20131165) ( ;  ). The highly conserved Pro1162 in the hinge region could be responsible to disrupt helical secondary structures and to form flexible structures. This added ability of CV3-25 likely offers an advantage in capturing an easily accessible epitope in the hinge region and subsequently progressively twisting the helix to establish contact with the \u03b1-helical region of the stem. The relative conservation of this hinge is likely related to the observed allosteric communication from the RBD all the way down to S2. The post-fusion conformation of S forms a six-helix bundle structure when pulling two membranes together for fusion. This conformational change probably involves unwinding of the stem helix and loop to helix transition for the loose loop at the lower end. CV3-25 binding at both helix region and the random coil at the stem helix likely interrupts this S2 refolding, thus inhibiting membrane fusion. \n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of CV3-25 is its linear peptide epitope, which offers easy access to exploration of its potential as an immunogen. As the structure of the native S on the surface of virus particles revealed, access of CV3-25 is hindered by the need for rotation of the stem helix. However, such conformational readjustment is not needed for an immunogen. As such, eliciting antibodies targeting this S2 stem epitope using peptide or scaffold-presented peptide immunogens is predicted to be easier than when the entire S trimer is the antigen. The potential of the CV3-25 epitope described herein should be explored as a candidate immunogen for vaccines that could be effective against all emerging variants and possibly exhibit pan-coronavirus efficacy. \n\n### Limitations of the study \n  \nOur study suggests that neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 are also inhibitors of virus entry, e.g., by causing shedding of S1 or inhibiting membrane fusion, a hypothesis that requires future studies. We observed that potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants of concern by CV3-1 correlated with shedding of S1. A detailed understanding of how CV3-1 activates and sheds S1 requires higher resolution structures, and comparative studies among RBD-targeting antibodies are needed to understand what antibodies trigger S1 shedding. \n\nWe arrived at a model for CV3-25 bound to the S2 stem helix of S by flexible fitting of the X-ray structure of peptide bound to CV3-25 and 6XR8 into our cryoET density map. Structure validation of this model requires solving high-resolution structure of the native S glycoprotein bound to CV3-25. The evaluation of the CV3-25 epitope within the S2 stem as an immunogen with pan-coronavirus potential requires experimental vaccination studies. \n\n\n\n## Disclaimer \n  \nThe views expressed in this presentation are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Uniformed Services University, U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government. \n\n\n## STAR\u2605Methods \n  \n### Key resources table \n  \n  \n\n\n### Resource availability \n  \n#### Lead contact \n  \nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Walther Mothes ( ). \n\n\n#### Materials availability \n  \nAll reagents generated in this study will be made available by the lead contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement. \n\n\n\n### Experimental model and subject details \n  \n#### Cell lines \n  \n293T human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC) and 293T-ACE2 cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO  in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Wisent), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (VWR) and 100\u00a0U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Wisent). 293T-ACE2 cells stably expressing human ACE2 are derived from 293T cells and were maintained in medium supplemented with 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of puromycin (Millipore Sigma) ( ) \n\n\n#### Antibodies \n  \nThe human antibodies (CV3-1 and CV3-25) used in the work were isolated from the blood of convalescent donor S006 (male) recovered 41\u00a0days after symptoms onset using fluorescent recombinant stabilized Spike ectodomains (S2P) as probes to identify antigen-specific B cells as previously described ( ). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on plasmids expressing CV3-25 antibody heavy chain in order to introduce the GASDALIE mutations (G236A/S239D/A330L/I332E) using the QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) ( ). Two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins using MediMabs' 77-day Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC)-accredited protocol. Animals were hosted and handled at the CRCHUM Animal Facility and the experimental protocol received approval from the Institutional Animal Protection Committee prior the beginning of the manipulation (protocol #IP18039AFl). The first immunization was done using complete Freund's adjuvant (Millipore Sigma) followed by 4 immunizations with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Millipore Sigma). Rabbits were used solely for this project and were sacrificed by total exsanguination. Blood was processed and serum was further used in immunoprecipitation experiments at 1:1000 dilution. \n\n\n#### Mice \n  \nAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of and Institutional Biosafety Committee of Yale University (IBSCYU). All the animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the facilities provided and supported by Yale Animal Resources Center (YARC). hACE2 transgenic B6 mice (heterozygous) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. 6\u20138-week-old male and female mice were used for all the experiments. The heterozygous mice were crossed and genotyped to select heterozygous mice for experiments by using the primer sets recommended by Jackson Laboratory. \n\n\n\n### Method details \n  \n#### Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis \n  \nThe plasmids expressing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 Spike was previously reported ( ). The plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S RBD (residues 319\u2013541) fused with a hexahistidine tag was previously described ( ). The individual mutations in the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressor, the furin cleavage site mutations (R682S/R683S) and the Spike from the B.1.429 lineage (S13I, W152C, L452R, D614G) were generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The amino acid deletions in the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressor were generated using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). The presence of the desired mutations was determined by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmids encoding the Spike from the B.1.1.7 lineage (\u039469-70, \u0394144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H), the B.1.351 lineage (L18F, D80A, D215G, \u0394242\u2013244, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V), the P.1 lineage (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I) and the B.1.526 lineage (L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K, D614G, A701V) were codon-optimized and synthesized by Genscript. The plasmids encoding the Spike from the B.1.617.1 (E154K, L452R, E484Q, D614G, P681R) and the B.1.617.2 (T19R, \u0394156\u2013158, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N) lineages were generated by overlapping PCR using a codon-optimized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene that was synthesized (Biobasic, Markham, ON, Canada) and cloned in pCAGGS as a template. All constructs were validated by Sanger sequencing. The plasmid encoding for the ACE2-Fc chimeric protein, a protein composed of an ACE2 ectodomain (1\u2013615) linked to an Fc segment of human IgG1 was previously reported ( ). \n\n\n#### Cryo-electron tomography sample preparation \n  \nLentiviral particles were collected and clarified by low-speed spinning (1500g for 5\u00a0min) twice, then pelleted by ultracentrifugation (130,000g for 2 h) once and resuspended in PBS buffer. 6\u00a0nm gold tracer was added to the concentrated S-decorated HIV-1 lentivirus at 1:3 ratio, and 5\u00a0\u03bcL of the mixture was placed onto freshly glow discharged holey carbon grids (R 2/1, Quantifoil) for 1\u00a0min. Grids were blotted with filter paper, and plunge frozen into liquid ethane by a homemade gravity-driven plunger apparatus. Frozen grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging. \n\n\n#### Cryo-electron tomography data collection \n  \nCryo-grids were imaged on a cryo-transmission electron microscope (Titan Krios, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV, using a Gatan K3 direct electron detector in counting mode with a 20 eV energy slit. Tomographic tilt series between \u221260\u00b0 and\u00a0+60\u00b0 were collected by using SerialEM ( ) in a dose-symmetric scheme ( ;  ) with increments of 3\u00b0. The nominal magnification was 64,000\u00d7, giving a pixel size of 1.346\u00a0\u00c5 on the specimen. The raw images were collected from single-axis tilt series with accumulative dose of \u223c120e per \u00c52. The defocus range was \u22122 to \u22126\u00a0\u03bcm and 9 frames were saved for each tilt angle. Detailed data acquisition parameters are summarized in  . \n\nFrames were motion-corrected using Motioncorr2 ( ) to generate drift-corrected stack files, which were aligned using gold fiducial makers by IMOD/etomo ( ). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was measured by the ctfplotter package within IMOD. Tilt stacks were CTF-corrected by ctfphaseflip within IMOD. Tomograms were reconstructed by weighted back projection and tomographic slices were visualized with IMOD. \n\n\n#### Cryo-electron tomography data analysis \n  \nFor the CV3-1 sample, all spikes were manually picked. Euler angles were determined based on the vector between two points, one on the head of the spike and the other on the membrane where the spike locates. For CV3-25 and unliganded samples, a low-pass filtered (30\u00c5) structure from previous aligned S structure was used as the template for template matching search in 8 x binned tomograms. Subtomograms were extracted for initial alignment. After this alignment, particles with cross-correlation coefficients (CCC) below 0.25 were removed. Visual inspection of the tomograms in IMOD confirmed that the rest of the subtomograms corresponded to S trimers on the viral surface. Particles that had tilted by more than 90\u00b0 relative to their perpendicular positions to the viral surface were excluded. Subsequent processing was performed by using I3 ( ) with 2 x and 4 x binned tomograms. \n\nAll the density maps were segmented in the UCSF Chimera ( ), and ChimeraX ( ;  ) was used for surface rendering and visualization of cryo-ET maps and models. \u201cFit in map\u201d tool in Chimera and ChimeraX was used for rigid fitting. iMODFIT was used for flexible fitting ( ). \n\n\n#### SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment conditions \n  \nFor all   in\u00a0vivo   experiments, the 6 to 8\u00a0weeks male and female mice were intranasally challenged with 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 FFU in 25\u201330\u00a0\u03bcL volume under anesthesia (0.5\u20135% isoflurane delivered using precision Dr\u00e4ger vaporizer with oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min). For NAb treatment using prophylaxis regimen, mice were treated with 250\u00a0\u03bcg (12.5\u00a0mg/kg body weight) of indicated antibodies (CV3-1 or CV3-25 GASDALIE) via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) 24\u00a0h prior to infection. The starting body weight was set to 100%. For survival experiments, mice were monitored every 6\u201312\u00a0h starting six days after virus administration. Lethargic and moribund mice or mice that had lost more than 20% of their body weight were sacrificed and considered to have succumbed to infection for Kaplan-Meier survival plots. \n\n\n#### Focus forming assay \n  \nTiters of virus stocks was determined by standard plaque assay. Briefly, the 4\u00a0\u00d7 105 Vero-E6 cells were seeded on 12-well plate. 24\u00a0h later, the cells were infected with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of serially diluted virus stock. After 1 h, the cells were overlayed with 1mL of pre-warmed 0.6% Avicel (RC-581 FMC BioPolymer) made in complete RPMI medium. Plaques were resolved at 48\u00a0h post infection by fixing in 10% paraformaldehyde for 15\u00a0min followed by staining for 1\u00a0h with 0.2% crystal violet made in 20% ethanol. Plates were rinsed in water to visualize plaques. \n\n\n#### Measurement of viral burden \n  \nIndicated organs (nasal cavity, brain, lungs from infected or uninfected mice were collected, weighed, and homogenized in 1\u00a0mL of serum free RPMI media containing penicillin-streptomycin and homogenized in 2\u00a0mL tube containing 1.5\u00a0mm Zirconium beads with BeadBug 6 homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, TEquipment Inc). Virus titers were measured using three highly correlative methods. Frist, the total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using RNeasy plus Mini kit (Qiagen Cat # 74136), reverse transcribed with iScript advanced cDNA kit (Bio-Rad Cat #1725036) followed by a SYBR Green Real-time PCR assay for determining copies of SARS-CoV-2\u00a0N gene RNA using primers SARS-CoV-2\u00a0N F: 5\u2032\u2019-ATGCTGCAATCGTGCTACAA-3\u2032\u2019 and SARS-CoV-2\u00a0N R: 5\u2032-GACTGCCGCCTCTGCTC-3\u2032. \n\nSecond, serially diluted clarified tissue homogenates were used to infect Vero-E6 cell culture monolayer. The titers per milligram of tissue were quantified using standard plaque forming assay described above. \n\n\n#### Analyses of signature inflammatory cytokines mRNA \n  \nBrain and lung samples were collected from mice at the time of necropsy. Approximately, 20\u00a0mg of tissue was suspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of RLT lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted using RNeasy plus Mini kit (Qiagen Cat # 74136), reverse transcribed with iScript advanced cDNA kit (Bio-Rad Cat #1725036). To determine levels of signature inflammatory cytokines, multiplex qPCR was conducted using iQ Multiplex Powermix (Bio Rad Cat # 1725848) and PrimePCR Probe Assay mouse primers FAM-GAPDH, HEX-IL6, TEX615-CCL2, Cy5-CXCL10, and Cy5.5-IFNgamma. The reaction plate was analyzed using CFX96 touch real time PCR detection system. Scan mode was set to all channels. The PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C 2\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 45 s, followed by a melting curve analysis to ensure that each primer pair resulted in amplification of a single PCR product. mRNA levels of Il6, Ccl2, Cxcl10 and Ifng in the cDNA samples of infected mice were normalized to Gapdh with the formula \u0394Ct(target gene)\u00a0= Ct(target gene)-Ct(Gapdh). The fold increase was determined using 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method comparing treated mice to uninfected controls. \n\n\n#### Virus-cell fusion inhibition assay \n  \nThe split nanoluc assay was used to measure antibody-mediated inhibition of virus-cell fusion ( ;  ). Pseudoviruses decorated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike were prepared by transfecting HEK293T cells (70% confluent 10\u00a0cm dishes) with a plasmid mixture of 5\u00a0\u03bcg of psPAX2 (Gag-pol, Rev, and Tat expression vector; does not express Vpr), 5\u00a0\u03bcg of pCMV-d19 Spike (last 19 residues at C-terminal were deleted) from the B.1.1.7 variant or WH01 G614, and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of a pCAGGS-Cyclophilin A-HiBiT construct using polyetherimide (PEI). Two days post transfection, virus containing supernatants were clarified using a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcM PDVF filter (Pall Corp, NY, USA # 4614) and pelleted by ultracentrifugation on a 15% sucrose cushion before resuspension in culture media to achieve a 20X concentration over the original volume. Freshly prepared viruses were incubated for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C with triplicate, 10-fold serial dilutions of CV3-25 antibody or non-specific IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA # 305-005-003) in a white, flat bottom 96 well plate (Greiner Bio-One, NC, USA # 655083). \n\nHEK293T-ACE2 target cells were transfected in a 24 well plate using PEI with 500ng/well of pMX Puro PH-LgBiT (LgBiT-tagged to pleckstrin homology domain of human phospholipase C\u03b4 the N terminus,  ). 1\u00a0day post transfection, cells were resuspended at 2\u00d710  cells/ml in culture media containing Nano-Glo\u00ae Endurazine Live Cell Substrate\u2122 (Promega Inc, WI, USA # N2571) and DrkBiT (Promega Inc, WI, USA # CS3002A01) according to the manufacturer's recommended concentrations and incubated for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. Labeled target cells were passed through a 70\u00a0\u03bcM cell strainer and added to the virus\u00a0+ antibody dilution plate (10  cells/well). The assay plate was then incubated for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C before measuring luminescence with a Tristar multiwell luminometer (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany). %RLU was calculated by normalizing RLU values to wells without virus (min) and wells without antibody (max). \n\n\n#### smFRET imaging of S on SARS-CoV-2 VLPs \n  \nLentiviruses carrying SARS-CoV-2 spikes were prepared similarly as previously described ( ). Two short peptides labeling tags (Q3: GQQQLG; A4: DSLDMLEM) were introduced into designed positions in the S1 subunit on the plasmid encoding SB.1.1.7, pCMV-SB.1.1.7. Plasmids pCMV-SB.1.1.7, dual-tagged pCMV-SB.1.1.7 Q3-1 A4-1, and pCMV delta R8.2 were transfected into 293T cells at a ratio of 20:1:21. Using this very diluted ratio of tagged-S vs. wildtype S, for the virus particles containing tagged S, more than 95% S trimers will have one dual-tagged protomer and two wildtype protomers within a trimer. Using this strategy, we generated lentiviral particles with an average of one dual-tagged S protomer for conjugating FRET-paired fluorophores among predominantly wildtype S trimers presented on lentivirus surface. Viral particles were harvested 40\u00a0h post-transfection, filtered with a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm pore size filter, and partially purified using ultra-centrifugation at 25,000\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0h through a 15% sucrose cushion made in PBS. Then the particles were re-suspended in 50\u00a0mM pH 7.5 HEPES buffer, labeled with self-healing Cy3 and Cy5 derivatives (LD555-CDand LD650-CoA, respectively) and purified through an OptiprepTM (Sigma Aldrich) gradient as previously described ( ,  ,  ). smFRET images of viral particles was acquired on a home-built prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope, as described previously ( ). The conformational effects of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL CV3-1 and CV3-25 antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 spike were tested by pre-incubating fluorescently labeled viruses for 60\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C before imaging in the continued presence of the antibodies. Signals were simultaneously recorded on two synchronized ORCA-Flash4.0 V3 sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu) at 25 frames per second for 80\u00a0s smFRET data analysis was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks)-based customized SPARTAN software package ( ). Each FRET histogram was fitted into the sum of four Gaussian distributions in Matlab, where each Gaussian distribution represents one conformation and the area under each Gaussian curve estimates the occupancy of each state. \n\n\n#### Recombinant protein expression and purification \n  \nFreeStyle 293-F (Thermo Fisher) cells were grown to a density of 1\u00d710  cells/mL at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO2 with regular 135\u00a0rpm agitation. A plasmid encoding for non-cleavable, pre-fusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S ectodomain (1\u20131208) (HexaPro, S-6P [ ;  ]-a gift from Dr. Jason S. McLellan) with a removable C-terminal twin-strep tag was transfected into cells with EndoFectin Max (GeneCopoeia) using the manufacturer's protocol. One-week post-transfection, the clarified supernatant was purified on strep-tactin resin (IBA) followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 200\u00a0mM NaCl as the running buffer (SEC buffer). The C-terminal twin-Strep-Tag was removed by HRV3C (Sigma Aldrich) digestion overnight at 4\u00b0C and the uncleaved protein was removed by passage over Ni-NTA resin. The cleaved protein was further purified on a Superose 6 10/300 column in SEC buffer. Alternatively, cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for SARS-CoV-2 RBD or ACE2-Fc and were purified on Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen) or Protein A resin (Cytiva), respectively. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Only freshly isolated protein was used for Cryo-EM grid preparations. \n\nExpression plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains of CV3-1 IgG or CV3-25 IgG were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) with ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent using the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher). After 6-days post transfection, antibody was purified on Protein A resin from cell supernatant (Thermo Fisher). Fab was generated by overnight papain digestion at 37\u00b0C using immobilized papain agarose (Thermo Fisher). Fab was separated from Fc and uncleaved IgG by passage over protein A resin followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 column before being used in SPR binding, X-Ray crystallography or Cryo-EM experiments. \n\n\n#### Surface plasmon resonance \n  \nAll surface plasma resonance assays were performed on a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare) with a running buffer of 10\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150\u00a0mM NaCl supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 at 25\u00b0C. Initial peptide scanning was performed by the binding of a series of SARS-CoV-2 S2 synthetic peptides (GenScript) to immobilized CV3-25 IgG (\u223c5800 RU) on a Protein A sensor chip (Cytiva). For the kinetic binding measurements of S2 peptides #289 (15-mer), #289 (11-mer) and the 26mer (1140\u20131165) to CV3-25, \u223c5800 RU of CV3-25 IgG was first immobilized on a protein A chip (Cytiva) and 2-fold serial dilutions of the S2 peptides were then injected with concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 200\u00a0nM. After each cycle the protein A sensor chip was regenerated with 0.1\u00a0M Glycine pH 2.0. CV3-1 IgG was used as a negative control. All sensorgrams were corrected by subtraction of the corresponding blank channel in addition to the buffer background and the kinetic constant determined using a 1:1 Langmuir model with the BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare). Goodness of fit of the curve was evaluated by the Chi2 value with a value below 3 considered acceptable. \n\n\n#### Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection \n  \nThe purified non-tagged SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike (293F produced) was incubated with 20-fold excess of CV3-25 Fab overnight at 4\u00b0C before purification on a Superose 6 300/10 GL column (GE Healthcare). The complex peak was harvested, concentrated to about 0.5\u00a0mg/mL in SEC buffer and immediately used for CryoEM grid preparation. 3\u00a0\u03bcL of protein was deposited on a holey copper grids (QUANTIFOIL R 1.2/1.3, 200 mesh, EMS) which had been glow-discharged for 30s at 15 mA (Tedpella Inc). The grids were vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) with a blot time of 2\u20134\u00a0s and the blot force of 20 at 4\u00b0C and 95% humidity. \n\nCryo-EM data from a good grid were acquired in 300kV Titan Krios electron microscope, equipped with a Gatan K2-BioQuantum\u00a0Image filter camera system (Thermo Fisher and Gatan Inc.) in National Cancer Institute/NIH IRP cryoEM facility, Bethesda MD. 50-frame image stacks were collected at a magnification of 165,000x, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.821\u00a0\u00c5/pixel, with a total exposure dose of 59.3 e /\u00c5 from 5s exposure. \n\n\n#### CryoEM data processing, model building and analysis \n  \nMotion correction, CTF estimation, particle picking, curation and extraction, 2D classification, ab initio model reconstruction, volume refinements and local resolution estimation were carried out in cryoSPARC ( ;  ). An initial SARS-CoV-2 spike model (PDB:   [ ]) with single-RBD up was used as a modeling template. The NTDs were initially modeled from PDB entry 7LY3( ). The initial docking model for CV3-25 Fab was taken from the crystallography model in this study. \n\nAutomated and manual model refinements were iteratively carried out in ccpEM ( ), Phenix (real-space refinement) ( ) and Coot( ). Geometry validation and structure quality evaluation were performed by EM-Ringer ( ) and Molprobity ( ). Model-to-map fitting cross correlation and figures generation were carried out in USCF Chimera, Chimera X ( ;  ,  ) and PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.). The complete cryoEM data processing workflow is shown in   and statistics of data collection, reconstruction and refinement is described in  . \n\n\n#### Crystallization and structure determination of CV3-25 with S2 stem peptide \n  \nCV3-25 Fab was prepared and purified as described ( ). 10\u00a0mg/mL of CV3-25 was mixed with synthetic S2 peptide spanning residues 1153\u20131163, 1153\u20131167 or 1140\u20131165 (26mer) in a 1:10 molar ratio of Fab to peptide. Crystal screening of Fab-peptide complexes were performed using the vapor-diffusion hanging drop method using the sparse matrix crystallization screens ProPlex (Molecular Dimensions), Index (Hampton Research), or Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research) with a 1:1 ratio of protein to well solution. After approximately 2\u00a0weeks incubation at 21\u00b0C, diffraction-quality co-crystals of the Fab-26mer were obtained in 0.1\u00a0M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 20% PEG4000 and 20% isopropanol. Crystals were snap-frozen in the crystallization condition supplemented with 20% 2-methyl-2, 4-pentanediol (MPD) as the cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the SSRL beamline 9-2 and was processed with HKL3000 ( ). The structure was solved by molecular replacement in Phenix ( ) using a CV3-25 framework model generated by SAbPred ( ). Iterative cycles of model building and refinement were done in Coot ( ) and Phenix. Structural analysis and figure generation were performed in PyMOL and ChimeraX. Fab-peptide interface and buried surface area were determined in PISA ( ). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in  . \n\n\n#### Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface staining \n  \nUsing the standard calcium phosphate method, 10\u00a0\u03bcg of Spike expressor and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressor (pIRES2-eGFP; Clontech) was transfected into 2\u00a0\u00d7 10  293T cells. At 48h post transfection, 293T cells were stained with anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies CV3-25, CV3-1 (5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) or using the ACE2-Fc chimeric protein (20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 45\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Alternatively, to determine the Hill coefficients ( ), cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of CV3-25 or CV3-1 (0.04\u201320\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H\u00a0+ L) Abs (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies to stain cells for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The percentage of transfected cells (GFP\u00a0+ cells) was determined by gating the living cell population based on the basis of viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10.5.3 (Tree Star). Hill coefficient analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad). Alternatively, for peptide epitope competition assay, CV3-25 (5\u03bcg/mL) was pre-incubated in presence of increasing concentrations of peptide #288 (1149-KEELDKYFKNHTSPD-1163), peptide #289 (1153-DKYFKNHTSPDVDLG-1167), a shorter version of peptide #289 (1153-DKYFKNHTSPD-1163) or a scramble version of the peptide #289 (DHDTKFLNYDPVGKS), which were synthesized by Genscript. \n\n\n#### Viral neutralization assay \n  \n293T-ACE2 target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles ( ). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the lentiviral vector pNL4.3 R-E\u2212 Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike at a ratio of 5:4. Two days post-transfection, cell supernatants were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. 293T-ACE2 target cells were seeded at a density of 1\u00d710  cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (PerkinElmer) 24h before infection. To measure virus neutralization, recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100\u00a0\u03bcL were incubated with increasing concentrations of CV3-1 or CV3-25 (0.01\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 1h at 37\u00b0C and were then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37\u00b0C; cells were lysed by the addition of 30\u00a0\u03bcL of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle. An LB942 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of each well after the addition of 100\u00a0\u03bcL of luciferin buffer (15\u00a0mM MgSO , 15\u00a0mM KH PO  [pH 7.8], 1\u00a0mM ATP, and 1\u00a0mM dithiothreitol) and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00a0mM D-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume). The neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (IC ) represents the antibody concentration inhibiting 50% of the infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by recombinant viruses bearing the indicated surface glycoproteins. Alternatively, for peptide epitope competition assay, CV3-25 (10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was pre-incubated in presence of increasing concentrations of peptide #289 (1153-DKYFKNHTSPDVDLG-1167) or a scramble version of the same peptide (DHDTKFLNYDPVGKS). \n\n\n#### Radioactive labeling and immunoprecipitation \n  \nFor pulse-labeling experiments, 5\u00a0\u00d7 10  293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressors. One day after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled for 16\u00a0h with 100\u00a0\u03bcCi/mL [ S]methionine-cysteine ([ S] protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 10% of dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1X GlutaMAX\u2122 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were subsequently lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (140\u00a0mM NaCl, 8\u00a0mM Na HPO , 2\u00a0mM NaH PO , 1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1.2mM sodium deoxycholate [DOC]) with protease inhibitors (ThermoFisher Scientific). Precipitation of radiolabeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins from cell lysates or supernatant was performed with CV3-25 in combination with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 45\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). \n\n\n#### Peptide scanning ELISA \n  \nSARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) The SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA assay used was adapted from a previously described ELISA ( ). Peptides covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 S2 sequence with a length of 15 residues (15-mer) and an overhang of 4 residues were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies. Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 S2 peptide pools or individual peptides (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) as a negative control, were prepared in PBS and were adsorbed to plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Coated wells were subsequently blocked with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% BSA) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Wells were then washed four times with washing buffer (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). CV3-25 mAb (50\u00a0ng/mL) was prepared in a diluted solution of blocking buffer (0.1% BSA) and incubated with the peptide-coated wells for 90\u00a0min at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-IgG secondary Abs (Invitrogen) (diluted in a diluted solution of blocking buffer [0.4% BSA]) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, followed by four washes. HRP enzyme activity was determined after the addition of a 1:1 mix of Western Lightning oxidizing and luminol reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Light emission was measured with an LB942 TriStar luminomete (Berthold Technologies). Signal obtained with BSA was subtracted for each plate. \n\n\n#### Western blotting \n  \n293T-S cells express the wild-type S glycoprotein from a SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain ( ). 293T-S cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1\u00d710  cells per well on day 0. On day 1, cells were either induced with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL doxycycline or mock treated as a control. Two days after induction, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1x PBS, 1% NP-40, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using the CV3-1 or CV3-25 antibodies; mouse anti-S1 antibody (Sino Biological) and rabbit anti-S2 antibody (Sino Biological) were used as controls. The Western blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-human IgG, anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG, correspondingly). To evaluate antibody recognition of S glycoproteins lacking N-linked glycans, 293T-S cells expressing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S glycoprotein were lysed with lysis buffer, as described above. Lysates were treated with PNGase F (NEB) following the manufacturer's instructions or mock treated as a control. The lysates were then Western blotted with the CV3-25 antibody, as described above. \n\n\n\n### Quantification and statistical analysis \n  \nData were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical significance for pairwise comparisons were derived by applying non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (two-tailed). To obtain statistical significance for survival curves, grouped data were compared by log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. To obtain statistical significance for grouped data we employed one-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak post-test ( A and 1B,  F and 3G) or 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests ( D).p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Endogenously produced H S plays numerous beneficial roles including mediating vasodilation and conferring neuroprotection. Due to its high membrane permeability, exogenously produced H S originating from the gut microbiota can also influence human physiology and is implicated in reducing intestinal mucosal integrity and potentiating genotoxicity and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Gut microbial H S production is often attributed to dissimilatory sulfate reducers such as   Desulfovibrio   and   Bilophila   species. However, an alternative source for H S production, cysteine degradation, is present in some gut microbes, but the genes responsible for cysteine degradation have not been systematically annotated in all known gut microbes. We classify mechanisms of cysteine degradation into primary, secondary, and erroneous levels of H S production and perform a comprehensive search for primary, secondary, and erroneous cysteine-degrading enzymes in 4,644 non-redundant bacterial genomes from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) catalog. Of the 4,644 genomes we have putatively identified 2,046 primary, 1,951 secondary, and 5 erroneous cysteine-degrading species. We identified the presence of at least one putative cysteine-degrading bacteria in metagenomic data of 100% of 6,623 healthy subjects and the expression of cysteine-degrading genes in metatranscriptomic data of 100% of 736 samples taken from 318 individuals. Additionally, putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are more abundant than sulfate-reducing bacteria across healthy controls, IBD patients and CRC patients (  p   < 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Although we have linked many taxa with the potential for cysteine degradation, experimental validation is required to establish the H S production potential of the gut microbiome. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the capacity for H S production by the human gut microbiome and may help to inform interventions to therapeutically modulate gut microbial H S production. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHydrogen sulfide (H S) is a consequential molecule produced by the gut microbiota with pleiotropic effects on human physiology. It is one of the three physiological gasotransmitters, along with carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, and is produced endogenously in many tissues including, but not limited to, the brain, heart and liver ( ). Endogenous H S production occurs via the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (  cbs  ), cystathionine gamma-lyase (  cse  ) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (  3-mst  ) ( ).   cbs  ,   cse   and   3-mst   are tightly regulated pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes and produce H S primarily from the degradation of cysteine ( ;  ). H S produced by these enzymes plays a litany of physiological roles including: suppression of oxidative stress in the brain, regulation of blood pressure through vasodilation and protection of hepatic stellate cells from cirrhosis in the liver ( ). As a result, abnormally low endogenous levels of H S are hypothesized to be an underlying cause of peripheral artery disease, and efforts have been made to measure serum levels of H S quickly and non-invasively as a proxy for early detection of peripheral artery disease ( ). \n  \nH S production via cysteine degradation in the human gut microbiome.   (A)   Pathways of H S production via cysteine degradation in the human gut microbiome. Pathways with labels ending in \u201cactivity\u201d refer to a set of genes that convert cysteine to the indicated products. Cysteine desulfurase activity (CYD) = (  dcyD, mgl, metC, cysM, cysK, malY, yhaM, tnaA, iscS  ). AMetR = AdoMet recycling present in   Bacillus subtilis   (  metK  , various methylases,   mtnN  ,   luxS  ) ( ).   (B)   Visualization of H S production across human tissues (image obtained from  ). H S is produced endogenously in the brain, liver, and heart via cystathionine gamma-lyase and cystathionine beta-synthase and is tightly regulated to avoid toxic effects of H S overproduction. Color coded organs refer to the type of H S production active in those organs.   (C)   Physiological effects of H S on the healthy, IBD and CRC gut. H S contributes to the degradation of the protective mucosal barrier which could cause or exacerbate inflammation and infection by opportunistic species for patients diagnosed with IBD. In CRC,   Fusobacterium nucleatum   is closely associated with colonic tumors and are well known H S producers ( ). \n  \nMicrobes in the gastrointestinal tract also contribute to H S production in humans. A majority of the microbially produced H S originates in the colon, where estimates of luminal concentrations of H S range from 0.3 to 3.4 mM ( ). The serum concentration of H S in healthy individuals is difficult to measure but is estimated to range from 34.0 to 36.4 \u03bcM ( ). H S readily diffuses across the intestinal epithelium and can enter circulation influencing host physiology ( ). Excessive production of H S by gut microbes has been linked with decreased mucosal integrity through reduction of mucosal disulfide bonds ( ), inhibition of colonocyte butyrate oxidation via cytochrome-c inhibition ( ), and genotoxicity ( ;  ). A prime example of the gut microbiome effecting gut health is association of   Fusobacterium nucleatum  \u2014a known H S producer\u2014with colonic tumors ( ;  ). \n\nWhile the mammalian pathways of H S production have been well studied, the contribution of gut-microbial H S production to circulating H S levels and the subsequent systemic effects on human physiology are largely unknown. The first step toward a better understanding of the effects of H S on human physiology is to identify which microbial species are responsible for H S production. There are two major sources for H S production in the human gut microbiota, dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) and the degradation of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine ( ). We must note that sulfate is first reduced to sulfite before H S is produced, however, we refer to this process as sulfate reduction for the remainder of this work. \n\nIn the literature, H S production is often attributed to the well-characterized dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway ( ). Common representatives of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are found in the phylum   Desulfobacterota   (recently reclassified from the class   Deltaproteobacteria  ) with   Desulfovibrio   spp. and   Bilophila wadsworthia   being the most abundant representatives in the human gut ( ;  ). Sulfate and sulfite are used by SRB as terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration ( ). While SRB are prevalent in human populations, their relative abundances are generally very low and are dependent on ecological interactions with other hydrogenotrophs, such as methanogens and acetogens ( ;  ;  ). Methane (CH ) is primarily produced by the methanogen   Methanobrevibacter smithii   ( ) and is one of the primary gases present in mammalian flatus. Sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens have been historically considered mutually exclusive in microbial communities due to the competition for hydrogen ( ). However, experiments carried out on human flatus have shown that both H S and CH  production occurs simultaneously in some individuals, seemingly contradicting the notion that methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria cannot co-exist ( ). \n\nUnlike the comprehensively characterized pathways for dissimilatory sulfate reduction, the species of the gut microbiome responsible for H S production via degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) have not been comprehensively characterized. Gut microbial involvement in amino acid fermentation has garnered recent attention, as many physiologically relevant downstream metabolites are produced by gut microbial degradation of amino acids ( ;  ). Depending on dietary intake, a pool of sulfur-containing amino acids is available for fermentation by gut microbiota ( ). Various studies have demonstrated that cysteine supplementation leads to far more H S production than inorganic sulfate supplementation underscoring the comparative importance of the cysteine-degradation pathway in total H S production ( ;  ;  ). \n\nIt is important to delineate between H S produced via dissimilatory sulfate reduction and H S produced via cysteine degradation because different approaches are necessary to modulate these two sources of H S production. Because of the poor annotation of the genes which produce H S via cysteine degradation across species of the gut microbiome, the relative contributions of cysteine-degradation and sulfate-reduction to overall exogenous H S production are unclear. To address this gap, we designed a bioinformatic approach to first identify putative cysteine-degrading bacteria in the human gut microbiome and then compared the relative abundances of putative cysteine-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria across metagenomic data from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), and healthy cohorts ( ). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo identify species capable of H S production via cysteine-degradation in the human gut microbiome, we curated profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) of enzymes with experimental evidence of H S production via cysteine-degradation and classified them into primary, secondary and erroneous producers of H S. Enzymes which produce H S via cysteine degradation as their primary function are labeled \u201cprimary\u201d (  dcyD  ,   yhaM  ,   mgl  ,   sseA  ) and enzymes which also participate in separate mechanism(s), such as the transsulfuration pathway and maltose regulon modulation, have been labeled \u201csecondary\u201d (  metC  ,   malY  ,   cysK  ,   cysM  ,   mccB  ). Enzymes which have a well-defined function other than H S production via cysteine-degradation are labeled \u201cerroneous\u201d (  tnaA  ,   iscS  ,   mccA  ). Please see   for more information. \n\n### Cysteine-Degrading Genes Are Widely Distributed in the Human Gut Microbiome \n  \nWe performed a homolog search for these H S producing enzymes across 4,644 species in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection ( ) using   (  and  ). This collection comprises 4,644 non-redundant genome sequences from species representatives generated by clustering 204,938 genome sequences from bacteria known to inhabit the human gut. Of the representative UHGG species, 44.1% (2,046/4,644) contain one or more primary cysteine-degrading gene, 42.0% (1,951/4,644) contain one or more secondary cysteine-degrading gene, and 1.1% (5/4,644) contain one or more erroneous cysteine-degrading gene. Aside from known cysteine-degrading bacterial species compiled in the manual curation step, an additional 3,065 species from the UHGG catalog were found to contain one or more cysteine-degrading genes ( ,  , and  ). \n  \nPresence of cysteine-degrading genes across the human gut microbiome. Important genera of the human gut microbiome and the presence/absence of cysteine-degrading genes in each clade. The taxonomic tree is obtained from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome collection (UHGG) ( ) which is built on the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) ( ). Phyla names are annotated on the left side. Phyla followed by a capital letter, e.g., Desulfobacterota (A), indicate a novel phyla classified by the GTDB-tk ( ). The bar chart in the center of the figure represents the number of species contained under each genus or higher clade. The color of the circles on the right indicates whether the gene is a primary (green), secondary (yellow) or erroneous (red) producer of H S ( ). The circles on the right side represent the number of species in each clade that contain hits to the genes specified. Nodes collapsed at levels higher than genus are because all genomes in that clade contain the same combination of genes reported in the grid on the right. The full, untruncated version of this figure is available in the supplementary information ( ). \n  \nThe prevalence and relative abundance of putative cysteine-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria was calculated for 10,700 metagenomic samples from healthy, IBD, CRC, and adenoma cohorts ( ;  ;  ;  ). Among the 6,632 healthy subjects, there is a markedly higher relative abundance of putative primary and secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria compared to sulfate-reducing bacteria (  p   < 2.2e-16, two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) ( ). This suggests that cysteine-degradation may contribute considerably to H S production for the average healthy person. Cysteine-degrading genes are also widespread in healthy populations with 100% of the 6,623 healthy subjects containing at least one putative cysteine-degrading bacteria in their gut microbiome ( ). \n  \nPutative primary and secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria are more prevalent than (SRB) among individuals with IBD, CRC, and healthy controls. Relative abundances of putative cysteine-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria across healthy and diseased populations. Relative abundances were calculated using Kraken2 ( ) (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d).   (A)   Data obtained from curatedMetagenomicData ( ). Number of samples per disease category: control = 560, CRC = 352, adenoma = 143, IBD = 148.   (B)   Data obtained from HMP2 ( ). Number of samples per disease category: non-IBD = 359, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 367, Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) = 591.   (C)   Data obtained from PRISM ( ). Number of samples per disease category: control = 56, UC = 76, CD = 88.   (D)   Data obtained from study on Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease ( ). Number of samples per disease category: control = 26, CD = 86. \n  \n\n### Increased Relative Abundance of Putative Hydrogen Sulfide Producing Bacteria in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer Gut Microbiomes \n  \nWe assessed the relative abundance of putative cysteine-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria in individuals with the two most common clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer (CRC) and healthy controls ( ). Putative primary and secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria are significantly more abundant than sulfate-reducing bacteria across IBD and CRC populations from metagenomic samples obtained from curatedMetagenomicData ( ), the Integrative Human Microbiome Project 2 (HMP2) ( ), PRISM ( ;  ) (all   p   < 2.2 \u00d7 10 ) ( ). \n\nPutative primary cysteine-degrading bacteria are significantly more abundant in CRC than in the control groups (W = 123,784,   p   = 7.4 \u00d7 10 ) ( ) while putative secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria were found to be significantly less abundant in CRC compared to healthy controls (W = 79,734;   p   = 1.2 \u00d7 10 ). A similar trend follows for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease compared to healthy controls. Putative primary cysteine-degrading bacteria are significantly more abundant in IBD when compared to healthy controls and putative secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria are significantly less abundant than in healthy controls ( ). Within pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, there is no apparent difference in the abundance of putative primary and secondary cysteine-degrading bacteria ( ). \n\n\n### Primary and Secondary Cysteine-Degrading Genes Are Actively Expressed in the Human Gut Microbiome \n  \nTo confirm   in vivo   transcription of cysteine-degrading genes and sulfate-reducing genes in the human gut microbiome, we analyzed 736 metatrasncriptomic sequencing runs from 318 individuals across two studies: (1) The Health Professionals Follow-up Study (number of individuals = 308, number of samples = 677) ( ) and (2)   (number of individuals = 10, number of samples = 59). Both studies took multiple samples from participants over the course of time and/or dietary intervention, hence the distinction between number of individuals and number of samples. Our analysis revealed that 86.5% (637/736) of samples show expression of at least one primary cysteine-degrading gene, 89.7% (660/736) of samples showed expression of at least one secondary cysteine-degrading gene and 84.1% (619/736) of samples showed expression of dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes   dsrA   and   dsrB   (  and  ).   yhaM   and   mgl   are the most actively transcribed primary cysteine-degrading genes with   malY   and   cysK   being the most actively transcribed secondary cysteine-degrading genes. The erroneous cysteine-degrading genes   tnaA  ,   iscS  , and   mccA   are considerably less transcribed across healthy human gut microbiomes ( ). These results suggest that primary and secondary cysteine degradation could be prominent pathways of H S production in some individuals. \n  \nCysteine-degrading genes are actively expressed in healthy adults. This analysis confirms that the H S producing genes considered in this work are actively expressed in healthy adults. The y-axis displays TPM counts for each gene involved in H S production via both cysteine degradation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction. The legend on the right indicates the mode of H S production for each of the genes examined. Metatranscriptomic reads from HPFS (number of individuals = 308, number of samples = 677) ( ;  ) (number of individuals = 10, number of samples = 59) ( ) were aligned to gene hit sequences identified in the homolog search step using salmon ( ) and visualized by the ggplot2 ( ) package in R ( ). Certain primary and secondary H S producing genes are actively produced by gut bacteria in healthy adults and erroneous producers of H S appear to be less actively transcribed. \n  \n\n### Core Dissimilatory Sulfate Reduction Genes and Methanogenesis Genes Are Co-expressed   in vivo  \n  \nPreviously,   in vitro   assays have indicated that methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria compete for hydrogen and may thus mutually exclude one another ( ). However, through analysis of 736 metatranscriptomic samples obtained from 318 individuals across two studies ( ;  ), we observed that core genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are simultaneously expressed in 25.8% (175/677) of samples from the HPFS study and in 11.9% (7/59) of samples from the   study ( ). This suggests that the mutual exclusivity of sulfate reducing bacteria and methane producing bacteria observed   in vitro   does not necessarily apply to the complex biogeography of the gut. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDue to its role as a mammalian gasotransmitter, H S plays important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. However, H S may also cause deleterious effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the sources of exogenous H S production in the gut in order to tease out the links between H S and human physiology. The source of gut microbial H S production is often attributed to dissimilatory sulfate reduction, with far less attention given to H S production via the degradation of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine. In fact, there has not been a microbiome-wide annotation of the potential for H S production via cysteine degradation. The systematic annotation we performed in this study expands our understanding of which species can potentially produce H S in the gut, the majority of which have not been previously reported to have the capability for H S production. Our analysis of shotgun sequenced metagenomic data from 10,700 metagenomic samples revealed that putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are ubiquitous inhabitants of the human gut microbiome and are present at significantly higher relative abundance than sulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, our analysis of 736 metatranscriptomic samples from 318 healthy individuals demonstrates that primary and secondary cysteine-degrading genes are, in fact, actively expressed in the gut. These results suggest that primary and secondary cysteine degradation could be prominent pathways of H S production in some individuals. Therefore, cysteine degradation is an important aspect to consider when designing studies to assess the effects of H S on human health or modulate gut microbial H S production. \n\nWe also explored the relative abundance of putative cysteine-degrading bacteria in IBD and CRC to understand whether these bacteria could contribute to or promote disease progression. We found that primary putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are significantly more abundant in CRC samples than in healthy controls. While relative abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria are modestly higher in CRC compared to healthy controls, primary putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are far more abundant. This finding corroborates previous studies linking H S and the progression of CRC ( ) and highlights the need to identify the dominant source of H S in the CRC gut. Importantly, it remains to be elucidated whether or not this difference in relative abundance translates to higher production of H S via cysteine degradation. \n\nPrior studies suggested that methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria are mutually exclusive, potentially due to their competition for hydrogen. However, subsequent studies have reported the presence of both CH  and H S in the human flatus ( ), seemingly contradicting this notion of mutual exclusivity of CH  and H S producing bacteria. To resolve this discrepancy, we examined the transcriptional co-occurrence of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and cysteine-degrading bacteria in the human gut and found the co-occurrence of all three pathways. This discrepancy between   in vitro   experiments and   in vivo   observations could be explained by the complex biogeography of the gut in which methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria occupy distinct niches or from H S production via cysteine degradation. \n\nThe primary limitation of this study is the lack of experimental confirmation of primary, secondary and erroneous putative cysteine-degrading bacteria. This could be addressed by performing a screen for H S production via cysteine degradation for all culturable strains that we have identified as putative cysteine-degrading bacteria. There are many reactions in which H S is formed as an intermediate, such as assimilatory sulfate reduction, however, these reactions do not result in significant production of H S and are thus not relevant to total H S production by the gut microbiome. Therefore, we limited our search for H S producing bacteria to pathways in which H S was the endpoint, or byproduct, and not just an intermediate of the pathway. Our search identified the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction in   Eggerthella   and   Gordonibacter   species. We have included these species as sulfate-reducing bacteria though there is little evidence to suggest that these species are true sulfate reducers ( ;  ). Experimental validation of these claims is necessary to confirm   Eggerethella   spp. and   Gordonibacter   spp. as non-sulfate-reducing bacteria. We also note that our search for H S producing genes included only the 4,644 representative genomes in UHGG. The full UHGG collection contains 204,938 non-redundant genomes with core and accessory gene information that may contain other putative H S-producing sub-species that we did not analyze. Another potential shortcoming of this analysis is the overrepresentation of western countries in the data pool used. An expanded set of samples would be required to claim that primary and secondary putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are globally prevalent in the human gut microbiome. Finally, we note that sulfate-reducing bacteria may be mucosally associated and present at low relative abundances which could mean that stool metagenomics may underestimate the true abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the human gut. \n\nIn conclusion, we show that the relative abundance of primary putative cysteine-degrading bacteria is significantly higher than sulfate-reducing bacteria across healthy individuals as well as individuals with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. These results bolster previous studies suggesting the importance of dietary cysteine in gut microbial H S production. The systematic annotation of putative H S-producing species performed in this study can serve as a resource for future studies examining the links between H S and disease and could help these studies to tease out the concentration-dependent effects of H S on human health. Overall, this work informs future approaches to modulate gut microbial H S production via dietary interventions and may lead to an improved understanding of the complex interplay between H S and human health and disease. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n provides a visual overview of the computational workflow carried out in this manuscript. This workflow is available at  . \n\n### Curation of Profile Hidden Markov Models Involved in Cysteine-Degradation and Sulfate-Reduction \n  \nWe performed a literature search to identify genes involved in H S production via dissimilatory sulfate reduction and sulfur-containing amino acid degradation by gut bacteria ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe pHMMs corresponding to the gene families responsible for H S production were obtained from TIGRFAM or HAMAP (the pHMMs used are listed in  ). If neither a TIGRFAM nor HAMAP pHMM was available for a given gene   or   the profile was too broadly defined, we opted to construct a custom pHMM to represent the gene of interest. Custom pHMMs were constructed by 1. concatenating amino acid sequences pertaining to the gene of interest 2. performing a multiple sequence alignment over these amino acid sequences using MUSCLE ( ) 3. constructing the pHMMs from the multiple sequence alignments using hmmbuild from the HMMER tool suite ( ). This was done to avoid identifying spurious homolog hits in the subsequent search step. pHMMs are detailed in  . \n\n\n### Search for Putative Hydrogen Sulfide Producing Bacteria in the Human Gut \n  \nThe pHMMs of H S producing genes were searched against 4,644 genome sequences from UHGG ( ) using the hmmscan method from hmmer v3.1 ( ) ( ). Hits were filtered based on a conservative   E  -value threshold (  E  -value < 1 \u00d7 10 ) and an additional bit score threshold was applied for TIGRFAM pHMMs to avoid calling spurious hits. Hits to HAMAP and custom pHMMs were only filtered based on the   E  -value threshold. Next, the bacterial genomes receiving hits were categorized into putative primary, secondary, and erroneous cysteine degraders based on the known mechanisms of the genes used in the search space. Genomes receiving hits to the   dsrAB   operon were labeled as sulfate-reducing bacteria. Please see   for a detailed description of the primary, secondary, and erroneous classification scheme. Primary, secondary, and erroneous putative cysteine-degrading bacteria across UHGG were then visualized by uploading a taxonomic tree in newick tree format to the iTOL ( ) web interface ( ). Gene containments for each of the UHGG genomes were converted to the EXTERNALSHAPE file format specified by iTOL documentation  and uploaded to the iTOL visualization file from the previous step. \n\n\n### Calculating Relative Abundances With Kraken 2 \n  \nRaw sequencing reads for samples from curatedMetagenomicData, HMP2, PRISM, and   were downloaded and extracted with NCBI\u2019s SRA toolkit v2.10.9 ( ). Quality control and adapter trimming of the fastq sequence files were done with the Trim Galore wrapper v0.6.6 ( ). To remove potential human contaminants, quality-trimmed reads were screened against the human genome (hg19) with Bowtie2 v2.4.2 ( ). Taxonomy profiling of the cleaned metagenomic reads were generated using Kraken 2 (2.0.8-beta) ( ) to estimate the relative abundance of bacterial species present in each dataset. These relative abundances are then processed and plotted in  . \n\n\n### Transcriptomic Analysis of Hydrogen Sulfide Producing Genes and Methane Producing Genes \n  \nWe sought to confirm the active expression of H S producing genes and CH  producing genes alongside the existing genomic evidence presented using metatranscriptomic data from   and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study ( ). Confirming the expression of H S producing and CH  producing genes involved the following steps: 1. Metadata for samples was downloaded from the SRA run selector.  2. Raw sequencing data was downloaded using fasterq-dump from the SRA toolkit version 2.10.9 ( ). 3. Manually curated H S producing genes and CH  producing genes were given as input to salmon index ( ). 4. Raw RNA-seq data were then quantified against the manually curated gene sequence database using the salmon quant command with the \u2013validateMappings option on for better performance. The raw counts of reads mapped per gene were normalized to TPM values for downstream analysis. The threshold for considering an H S gene \u201cexpressed\u201d was TPM > = 10. A sample was said to be \u201cmethane producing\u201d if \u226580% of the 16 genes involved in the methanogenesis pathway recruited one or more read mapping. These genes are listed in the   x  -axis of  . The results were then parsed with custom shell and R scripts and visualized in   and   using the R package ggplot2 ( ). All scripts and workflow is available at  . \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

First, healthy adult participants received a standard heat placebo induction and conditioning procedure using a topical \u201canalgesic\u201d cream applied to one arm. During a subsequent placebo testing procedure, participants rated stimuli on the placebo-treated arm and untreated arm, using a task that minimized subjects\u2019 ability to guess the expected response, thus reducing experimenter demand. Retrospectively participants reported moderate analgesia effectiveness (mean\u202f=\u202f5.3/10), but for individual temperature ratings, only 2 subjects exhibited a perceptual placebo response >5 points. Next, these subjects completed a novel, exploratory task designed to measure changes in inter-arm in discriminative accuracy that would be expected from changes in afferent nociception. Both placebo responders (but no non-responders) showed reduced discriminative ability when the hotter stimulus occurred on the placebo arm, an effect consistent with alterations in nociceptive afferent flow and unlikely to be caused by response bias. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPlacebo analgesia occurs when a person experiences a reduction in pain from a pharmacologically inert substance they believe to be an effective pain reliever. Placebo effects have been demonstrated in clinical trials as well as in laboratory studies of healthy volunteers (Vase, Petersen, Riley, & Price, 2009). Yet the mechanism underlying the placebo response remains controversial. One unresolved question is whether placebos actually alter sensory perception, or whether they merely bias reporting of pain (e.g. ( ,  ,  )). Placebo analgesia is almost always demonstrated using subjects\u2019 numerical estimates of perceptual experience. This makes them susceptible to response bias related to demand characteristics of the experiment ( ). In other words, subjects may report their pain to be reduced because they believe it should have been. \n\nPlacebo treatments have been shown to suppress activity in pain-related brain areas (e.g. ( ,  )), and two studies show suppression of early nociceptive responses argued to occur before the onset of evaluative and decision processes ( ,  ). However, a behavioral measure of placebo analgesia that is robust to response bias has not been available. Signal detection theory (SDT) has been applied to placebo analgesia ( ; Feather 1972) to assess the potential for changes in response bias. However, numerous concerns have been raised about its relationship with pain judgments and whether it can actually measure analgesia, as discussed in ( ,  ). \n\nTo test whether placebo analgesia alters sensory discrimination, we modified standard placebo manipulation procedures to reduce effects of experimenter demand (described in detail in Methods Section). We then conducted exploratory testing of a novel sensory discrimination task in two subjects who exhibited a perceptual placebo response (reduction in pain ratings) as well as in six subjects without a placebo response. Our task was statistically powered for within-subject analysis in order to determine whether, in subjects with a strong placebo response, there is evidence of altered afferent nociception. \n\nOur novel, exploratory assay of the sensory component of placebo analgesia was an inter-arm sensory discrimination task in which subjects compared the intensity of painful heat applied to an arm treated with a topical placebo analgesic to heat applied to an arm treated with a control moisturizer cream. The ability to discriminate differences in heat pain intensity is better for larger differences than small differences ( ). We therefore hypothesized that if placebo analgesia alters sensory processing, it should become   more difficult   to discriminate accurately between two heat stimuli if the   hotter   stimulus is applied to the arm treated with the placebo analgesic. In this case, the processing of the hotter stimulus should be reduced and the perceptual distance between the stimuli would be narrower (and vice versa when the hotter stimulus is applied to the control arm). Participants were asked to identify which arm had the hotter stimulus on each trial, avoiding the response bias involved in numerical ratings. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participant recruitment and screening \n  \nThis study was approved by the NIH CNS Institutional Review Board. Volunteer participants were included if they were English-speaking adults ages 18\u201350 and excluded for major medical conditions, third trimester pregnancy, chronic pain, conditions that could affect touch perception, allergies to topical treatments, or recent use of caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, narcotics, recreational drugs, pain-relieving medications, or centrally acting medications. All participants provided informed consent and were financially compensated for their time. Participants were instructed to abstain from caffeinated beverages for two hours prior to testing ( ) and were informed that they would receive some inaccurate information (see Supplementary Methods) during the study (\u201cauthorized deception\u201d ( ). \n\n\n### Heat stimuli \n  \nHeat stimuli were delivered using a 1-cm-diameter computer-controlled contact thermode (Medoc Pathway Model CHEPS, Medoc Ltd Advanced Medical System, Israel) and lasted approximately 1.5 sec, with a rise-time of 70\u202f\u00b0C/sec. \n\n\n### Placebo analgesic and control creams \n  \nThe placebo analgesic cream was packaged in an NIH Pharmacy bottle labeled NIH Compound 812C Cream 15G FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY and was applied using gloves. The control moisturizing cream was packaged in a commercial jar labeled as a generic moisturizer. Unbeknownst to participants, both creams were the same inert moisturizing cream. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nAs described below, Day 1 testing involved five sequential procedures designed to identify robust placebo responders: 1) screening, 2) heat pain range calibration, 3) pain intensity discrimination, 4) placebo induction, 5) perceptual placebo test (  see  ).   \nStudy Flow. A: 1) Participants underwent medical screening. 2) Participants rated single trials of heat on the pain rating scale ( -C) to identify their pain range. 3) Participants discriminated pairs of heat pain stimuli on four sites across the arms to measure baseline 2\u202f\u00b0C discrimination ability as well as arm bias (from equal temperature trials). 4) Placebo analgesic cream was applied to one arm and moisturizer to the other. Stimulus pairs were described as having equal temperatures, but the stimuli were in fact 4\u00b0hotter on the control arm. 5) A perceptual placebo test was administered to check whether the placebo analgesic cream reduced the perceived painfulness of single trial heat stimuli. B:   N  \u202f=\u202f2 perceptual placebo responders and   N  \u202f=\u202f6 non-responders completed the novel inter-arm sensory discrimination placebo test. If placebo analgesia (blue) alters sensory perception, it should be more difficult to discriminate between heat stimuli if the hotter stimulus is applied over the placebo analgesic, as the processing of the painful heat should be reduced, narrowing the perceptual distance between the stimuli. C: Participants rated the pain of heat stimuli on a 0\u201380 pain rating scale according to descriptors of heat and pain levels. The pain range was defined as 30\u201370 (\u201cweakly painful\u201d to \u201cintolerable pain\u201d). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nDay 1 Screening (  N  \u202f=\u202f40) ( ,  ): Subjects were told that they would be in a study further investigating characteristics of an established topical analgesic cream. Participants completed a clinical exam and review of exclusion criteria and were screened for drug use and psychotic disorders (MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, ( )). Two participants failed to meet medical criteria.   \nEffectiveness Ratings and Perceptual Placebo Ratings. Left: \u201cEffectiveness Ratings.\u201d Participants were asked to rate how effective they expected the cream to be (before placebo induction) and how effective they experienced the cream to be (after placebo induction) using a 0 to 10 scale (0 = \u201cNot at all effective\u201d and 10 = \u201cCompletely effective\u201d)(\u201cExpected Effectiveness\u201d). Right: \u201cPerceptual Placebo.\u201d Participants rated the painfulness of a series of stimuli on the placebo and control arms during the placebo testing task on the scale presented in  -C. \n  \n\nDay 1 Heat Pain Range Calibration (  N  \u202f=\u202f38) ( ,  ): Moisturizing cream was applied to four test regions on the volar surface of each forearm. Subjects were (truthfully) informed that this was to control for the effect of having a cream on the testing region. An ascending series of stimuli ranging from 35\u202f\u00b0C to 50\u202f\u00b0C was manually delivered; trials alternated arms and skin sites. Participants rated each stimulus on an 80-point numeric/verbal descriptor scale to determine individual pain range (  -C)  . After this initial ascending series, a random sequence of stimuli spanning the individual\u2019s pain range was presented to both arms in alternation to confirm pain threshold and tolerance. Ten subjects were dismissed after calibration because their ratings did not exhibit ordinal consistency with physical temperatures (using Kendall's tau (\u03c4)), their pain range did not span at least 4\u202f\u00b0C, or they exhibited \u201carm bias\u201d (rated the pain on one arm, on average, five points higher than on the other arm). \n\nDay 1 Pain Intensity Discrimination (  N  \u202f=\u202f28) ( ,  ): To test baseline inter-arm temperature discrimination ability, participants were presented with predetermined pairs of heat stimuli in a random sequence within their pain range and asked to report which was more painful. The first stimulus was applied to one arm and then the thermode was quickly transferred to the second arm and the second stimulus was applied. Arm order was switched halfway through the task and stimulus order (higher or lower stimulus first) was counterbalanced within each task. Pairs rotated through the 4 test locations. Twenty-four pairs were 2\u202f\u00b0C apart and 24 pairs were identical temperatures. Any subject exhibiting arm bias (binomial test comparing responses to the identical temperature pairs) or with a discriminative accuracy of<70% for 2\u202f\u00b0C pairs were to be dismissed at this stage, but no participant met these exclusion criteria. \n\nDay 1 Placebo Induction (  N  \u202f=\u202f28) (Figure 1.4): (  see  ,  ). Participants were asked to rate how effective they expected the cream to be (\u201cExpected Effectiveness\u201d) using a 0 (\u201cNot at all effective\u201d) to 10 (\u201cCompletely effective\u201d) scale. Then the placebo analgesic cream was applied to the volar surface of one forearm and the control moisturizing cream to the other arm (counterbalanced across participants). The experimenter timed 5\u202fmin for the placebo analgesic to be \u201cabsorbed.\u201d See Script in Supplementary Methods. Participants then received 4 pairs of temperatures that they were told were identical in order to \u201cmake sure the cream was working.\u201d Consistent with other placebo induction procedures ( ,  ,  ), the temperature administered to the control arm was actually 4\u202f\u00b0C higher than that administered to the placebo arm. For three pairs the participant reported which stimulus was more painful and for the fourth pair they rated each stimulus on the rating scale. \n\nDay 1 Perceptual Placebo Test (  N  \u202f=\u202f28) ( ,  ): To identify perceptual placebo responders, a random sequence of 20 single stimuli spanning the pain range was presented with successive stimuli alternating arms. Participants were told that a variety of temperature levels would be presented in random order. Sixteen of the 20 trials were the same temperature at the middle of the subject\u2019s pain range. In the remaining 4 trials, hotter stimuli were presented to the control arm and less-hot stimuli to the placebo arm; this was intended to reinforce the placebo induction. Data analysis did not include the ratings of these latter stimuli. \n\nParticipants rated the pain after each trial. A subject was declared a placebo responder if he or she rated the stimuli on the placebo arm, on average, at least 5 points less painful than the control arm. Two placebo responders were identified. At the end of the session all subjects were asked to rate how effective they found the analgesic cream to be (\u201cPerceived Effectiveness\u201d), using the same 0 \u2013 10 effectiveness scale on which they previously had rated expected effectiveness. \n\nDay 2 Sensory Placebo Test (  N  \u202f=\u202f2 placebo responders and 6 non-responder controls) ( B: Both Day 1 placebo responders completed Day 2. In addition, the 6 final subjects in the study (who were not placebo responders) were tested, in order to assess whether any observed sensory effects would be restricted to placebo responders. \n\nAfter the participant arrived on Day 2, the placebo induction was repeated. Next, the subject received pairs of heat stimuli spanning their pain range with one temperature presented to either arm and was asked to report which was more painful. There were 140 trials presented in 10 blocks of 14 randomly sequenced trials. Each block included 10 trials in which the stimuli differed by 2\u00b0 (five with the hotter stimulus applied to the placebo arm and five the reverse), two in which the stimuli were equal, and two in which they differed by 4\u00b0 (one in each direction). Thus of the 140 trials, 100 had a 2\u202f\u00b0C separation (half with the hotter stimulus on the placebo arm), which allowed us to test whether the placebo alters discrimination. Twenty trials had equal temperatures, which tested whether placebo reduces pain on the placebo arm. Ten trials presented a stimulus 4\u202f\u00b0C hotter to the placebo arm to ensure that the placebo arm would sometimes feel more painful. Finally, 10 presented a stimulus 4\u202f\u00b0C hotter to the control arm, which allowed us to reinforce the placebo induction throughout the session. After each of these last type of trials subjects were told that the temperatures were equal, \u201cto confirm the cream is still working.\u201d \n\nThe 100 trials of discriminating 2\u202f\u00b0C differences (50 in each direction) had power of .84 to detect a difference between binomial proportions of 0.75 (pilot-data-based predicted accuracy when stimuli differ by 2\u202f\u00b0C) and 0.50 (predicted accuracy after placebo induction based on a 2\u202f\u00b0C decrease in perceived pain intensity of stimuli delivered to the treated arm) (G* Power 3; ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwenty-eight participants (ages 21\u201347, 15 female) met all medical and psychophysical criteria and completed the full Day 1 testing session. \n\n### Sensory discrimination accuracy (Day 1) \n  \nAverage baseline sensory discrimination accuracy for trials with 2\u202f\u00b0C separation was 92.4% (  SD  \u202f=\u202f7.4%;    Mdn  \u202f=\u202f95.5%; range\u202f=\u202f71  \u2013  100%).  \n\n\n### Effectiveness ratings (Day 1) \n  \nParticipants consistently expected the cream to be moderately effective (  M  \u202f=\u202f5.5,   SD  \u202f=\u202f1.6). Following the manipulation, participants found the cream to be moderately effective (  M\u202f=  \u202f5.3,   SD  \u202f=\u202f2.0). There was no difference between expected effectiveness and perceived effectiveness (  t  (27) = 0.39,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.70, see  ) (   Mdn   after\u202f=\u202f5,   Mdn   before\u202f=\u202f5,   Z  \u202f=\u202f0.55,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.58).  \n\n\n### Perceptual placebo effect (Day 1) \n  \nOn average the 28 participants rated the heat on Day 1 as less painful after placebo induction (  M  \u202f=\u202f36.1) than before (  M  \u202f=\u202f40.4,   t  (27) = 3.33,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.01) (   Mdn before\u202f=\u202f42.1, Mdn after\u202f=\u202f36.9, Z\u202f=\u202f2.91, p\u202f=\u202f0.004   ). However, pain was not reduced more on average on the placebo arm (  M  \u202f=\u202f-3.7,   SD  \u202f=\u202f7.8) than on the control arm (  M  \u202f=\u202f-5.0,   SD  \u202f=\u202f6.5), indicating no group level placebo effect (  t  (27) = 1.53,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.14, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u202f=\u202f-0.16, see  ). Two participants (henceforth \u201cperceptual placebo responders\u201d) showed the perceptual placebo effect on Day 1, as defined by our   a priori   criterion of a 5-point rating difference between arms. These subjects showed 5.8 and 12.6 greater reduction in pain ratings on the placebo arm, respectively. This effect remained after subtracting initial arm bias. Individual Day 1 placebo effects for participants tested on Day 2 are presented in  .   \nDay 1 Pain Ratings Before and After Placebo Induction for Day 2 Participants Participants rated the painfulness of a series of stimuli on the placebo and control arms during the Day 1 placebo testing task on the scale presented in  -C. Pain ratings before placebo induction were subtracted from pain ratings after placebo induction and the Placebo Effect was calculated as the difference between the two arms. Average placebo effect for the full study sample is presented in  . A higher indicates a greater placebo effect (greater reduction in pain ratings on the placebo arm). \n  \n\n\n### Sensory placebo effect (Day 2) \n  \nUnequal temperatures: The first placebo responder was significantly more accurate discriminating temperatures separated by 2\u202f\u00b0C when the hotter stimulus was on the control arm than when it was on the placebo arm. The second placebo responder showed a similar but weaker effect (  see  ). One non-responder showed a difference in discrimination in the opposite direction but this pattern was also present at baseline, before the placebo induction (another showed a trend in this same direction).   \nSensory Discrimination on 2\u202f\u00b0C- Separated Trials Before and After Placebo Induction. During the sensory discrimination test 24 trials (before placebo) and 100 trials (after placebo) presented pairs of temperatures separated by 2\u202f\u00b0C. We hypothesized that if placebo analgesia alters sensory processing, it should be   easier   to discriminate between two heat stimuli if the   lower   stimulus is applied over the placebo analgesic, but   more difficult   to discriminate if the   hotter   stimulus is applied over the placebo analgesic. The number of trials on which a given arm was perceived as more painful is reported below. Accuracy when the hotter stimulus was placed on the placebo arm versus control arm was compared for each participant with a chi-square test. * indicates a significant change from before to after placebo,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05. \n  \n\nEqual temperatures: On trials with equal temperatures, 1 placebo responder and 1 non-responder showed a significant shift in arm bias from Day 1 (before induction) to Day 2 (after induction), such that after placebo induction they significantly more frequently identified the stimulus on the control arm as more painful (  see  ). One non-responder showed a significant shift in the other direction.   \nSensory Discrimination on Equal Trials Before and After Placebo Induction. During the sensory discrimination test 24 trials (before placebo) and 20 trials (after placebo) presented equal temperatures. The number of trials on which a given arm was perceived as more painful is reported below. These tallies were compared before and after placebo induction for each participant to determine whether placebo induction decreased the number of times the stimulus was perceived as more painful on the placebo arm. * indicates a significant change from before to after placebo,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing a standard heat placebo analgesia induction procedure that we modified to reduce response bias, we minimized overall placebo response but identified two individuals with a robust perceptual placebo analgesic response. In our exploratory novel inter-arm heat discrimination task, these subjects showed changes in heat discrimination accuracy, suggesting an alteration in sensory processing of afferent pain signals. Non-responders did not show this effect. \n\nAlthough we observed a moderate placebo analgesic effect when subjects rated the perceived effectiveness of the cream, we did not observe a placebo effect at the group level for single numerical ratings of painful heat. We believe this is due to our efforts to minimize response bias in our measurement of perceptual placebo analgesia, making our paradigm quite different from most studies of placebo analgesia. First, our sensory placebo test used a short inter-stimulus interval between the two stimuli in each pair to avoid temporal bias in ratings ( ,  ). Second, participants compared stimuli on a placebo site to a control site on every trial, while most studies test the placebo and control arm in different blocks \u2013 or in a separate control session or control group (see Table 4, Supplementary Methods) \u2013 making direct sensory comparison difficult. Third, we used short-duration pain stimuli; long-duration pain stimuli yield larger placebo responses ( ), possibly due to degradation of sensory memory. Fourth, we used multiple heat intensities in our study; most studies test only one temperature, making it easier for subjects to develop expectations about the stimuli and perhaps report what they think the experimenter wants. Finally, we weakened subjects\u2019 expectations by ensuring that some stimuli presented to the placebo arm clearly exceeded some presented to the control arm. Thus, the fact that we did not see significant placebo effects across all participants when we added these additional safeguards raises the possibility that response bias may underlie a portion of the placebo effect reported in other studies. \n\nIt is clear from our study that there are multiple types of responses that suggest placebo analgesia. For example, the majority of our subjects rated our cream as having been moderately effective, even though they did not show a placebo effect in rating the heat pain after each trial, suggesting a role of response bias in that placebo analgesia assessment. However, the two participants that exhibited a perceptual placebo effect \u2013 under stringent conditions designed to reduce response bias- also showed a sensory placebo effect on nociceptive processing, suggesting that placebo analgesia can exert a robust effect on sensory processing for some people, or some of the time. \n\nOn trials separated by 2\u202f\u00b0C, both placebo responders, but no non-responders, showed a trend or significantly poorer ability to discriminate heat pairs when the hotter stimulus was presented on the placebo arm- but not on 2\u202f\u00b0C trials when the hotter stimulus was presented on the control arm. This indicates not an overall shift in performance but a specific difference in processing hotter temperatures originating from the placebo arm: as the processing of pain from the placebo arm is decreased, the perceptual difference between the stimuli become narrower and more difficult to discriminate. Global changes in pain processing would affect sensory discrimination in both directions. \n\nOn equal-temperature trials, placebo induction significantly decreased the number of times than the placebo arm felt hotter for one PL-responder and one non-responder, and increased the number of times the placebo arm felt hotter for one non-responder. This confirms that placebo induction can alter the perception of pain, as previously known. Since the temperatures on these trials are equal, however, providing no difference in sensory input. a change in performance on these trials could reflect either a change in afferent processing or in response bias. \n\nAn observation of altered heat intensity discrimination would suggest a corresponding change in pain-related activation in primary somatosensory processing areas. Several brain imaging studies of placebo analgesia using experimental heat stimuli have found reductions in pain-related activation within brain regions with nociceptive neurons, including thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, insula, and cingulate cortex, e.g. ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Nevertheless, findings differed substantially among studies, and a recent   meta  -analysis of placebo effects on pain and brain responses to noxious stimuli ( ) revealed large effects on reported pain, but minute effects on the neurological pain signature pattern, a brain-based classifier that is highly specific to acute pain perception ( ). This suggests that placebo analgesia is primarily mediated by regions outside primary pain processing regions, and much of the perceptual placebo responses may reflect cognitive processes related to response bias. Indeed, in addition to the insula, discrimination of pain intensity involves prefrontal brain areas outside the primary processing regions ( ). Our current findings are consistent with this conclusion. The large majority of subjects who said they perceived the cream to be effective did not show alterations in pain ratings or in sensory discrimination. The observation that a small minority of subjects have a true sensory change could underlie the sporadic reports of placebo-related alterations in afferent pain processing, whereas perceptual placebo analgesia without sensory change could be mediated by other brain regions. Future experiments should pair discrimination tasks such as the one presented here with phenotyping and characterization of individual differences to determine whether there are identifiable factors that predict these sensory placebo responders. \n\n\n## Declarations of interest \n  \nnone \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6505707, "text_md5": "6885ff2d141421620bfe4de3e92514c3", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 165], "publication_year": [167, 171], "title": [182, 300], "keywords": [314, 370], "abstract": [383, 1995], "body": [2004, 26111]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31080912, "doi": "10.1016/j.ynpai.2018.09.001", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6505707", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6505707"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6505707\">6505707</a>", "list_title": "PMC6505707  Is placebo analgesia for heat pain a sensory effect?

Recently, it was discovered that certain segments of mutations, termed processive groups, occur on the same DNA strand and are generated by a single process or signature. Here we provide a first probabilistic model of mutational signatures that accounts for their observed stickiness and strand coordination. The model conditions on the observed strand for each mutation and allows the same signature to generate a run of mutations. It can both use known signatures or learn new ones. We show that this model provides a more accurate description of the properties of mutagenic processes than independent-mutation achieving substantially higher likelihood on held-out data. We apply this model to characterize the processivity of mutagenic processes across multiple types of cancer. \n   Graphical Abstract       Highlights  \n  \nStickySig is a method for learning mutational signatures and their exposures \n  \nStickySig models the stickiness and strand coordination of mutational signatures \n  \nStickySig outperforms existing independent mutation models \n  \nStickySig reveals the role of Signature 18 in generating processive groups \n  \n  \nQuantitative Genetics; Bioinformatics; Cancer \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMutational processes are key factors in shaping cancer genomes ( ,  ,  ,  ), and their characterization has important implications for understanding the disease and choosing targeted therapies ( ,  ,  ,  ). Multiple algebraic and statistical approaches have been suggested for the detection of mutational processes from somatic mutation data ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). These methods, which focus on single-base substitutions (consult  ), are based on learning the pattern of mutations of each potential process as well as its activity (aka   exposure  ) in any given tumor in a way that will best explain the observed mutation data. State-of-the-art approaches for learning mutational signatures include non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) that aim to explain the mutation counts as a sum over all signatures of the probability of a specific mutation to be generated by the respective signature times its exposure. Other approaches that borrow from the world of topic modeling (discovery of abstract topics in text documents) aim to provide a probabilistic model of the data so as to maximize the model's likelihood ( ,  ). However, most of these methods assume that mutations are independent of one another and cannot capture processes that create dependencies among them.   \nDefinitions and Conventions \n\nThe figure shows normal DNA, mutated DNA, representation and characteristics of DNA mutations, and different types of stickiness used in StickySig model variants. \n\n(A) The genome consists of the reference strand (the strand whose 5\u2032-end is on the short arm of the chromosome), also known as the Watson strand or the plus strand, and the complementary strand, also known as the Crick strand or the minus strand. \n\n(B) In the mutated DNA, changes in DNA base pair sequence are shown in red. \n\n(C) Single base-pair substitution (SBS) can be represented as a transition in which one base pair in normal DNA is replaced by another in mutated DNA. The reference allele refers to the nucleotide that is found in the reference strand of normal genomic DNA. The pyrimidine strand is the strand (+or \u2013) containing the pyrimidine base (C or T) in normal DNA. It is usually not known which base in a pair was the source of a mutation; thus, the convention is to annotate mutations from the pyrimidine base of the mutated base pair, leading to 6 substitution types (when context is not considered) or to 96 possible combinations of substitution types and neighboring bases. \n\n(D) The StickySig model can use several types of stickiness opportunities:   all mutations   can be sticky,   same strand   stickiness, mutations having a pyrimidine base in the normal DNA on the same strand as the previous mutation;   same allele   stickiness, mutations having the same reference allele as the previous mutation;   same substitution   stickiness, mutations having exactly the same base-pair substitution as the previous mutation;   same mutation   stickiness, mutations having the same mutation features (96 mutation category and pyrimidine strand) as the previous mutation; and   none,   no stickiness allowed that leads to MMM model. Other types of stickiness can be also considered. \n  \n\nRecently, it was observed that some signatures operate in a strand-coordinated manner where consecutive mutations tend to mutate from the same reference allele and occur on the same strand ( ). Morganella et\u00a0al. generalized these observations and found segments of such mutations (i.e., same reference allele and same strand) that they termed processive groups ( ). The length of a processive group, that is, the number of such consecutive mutations attributed to the same signature, is signature dependent. The significance and abundance of these processive groups suggested that certain mutational processes display stickiness and strand-coordination properties. In a previous work we have suggested a hidden Markov-based model for capturing sequential dependencies between close-by mutations ( ). Here we follow a similar path and suggest novel probabilistic models for consecutive, albeit not necessarily close-by, mutations that occur on the same strand. \n\nThe biological reasons for this strand coordination are related, at least in part, to the asymmetric role that the two strands play in many cellular processes that operate on DNA. For example, the APOBEC C-to-U editing enzymes are a major source of mutations in many cancer types and are known to act on single-stranded DNA ( ). Many cellular processes, including replication and transcription, require strand separation leaving one or both strands exposed. Importantly, if the strands are separated, one of the strands is often more exposed than the other, leading to asymmetric strand coordination of APOBEC mutations. In particular, during DNA replication, the two DNA strands are processed differently. In this process, one of the strands (the lagging strand) is more exposed than the other strand (the leading strand). Owing to these differences, APOBEC asymmetry between these two strands is particularly strong ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, leading and lagging strands are, among other differences, also processed by different polymerases, which might introduce different types of error in each strand leading to replication-related strand coordination. Transcription-coupled repair is another source of strand-specific mutagenesis. Another process leading to coordinated mutations and strand asymmetry is the formation DNA/RNA duplexes\u2014the so-called R-loops. R-loops are thought to form co-transcriptionally when nascent messenger RNA hybridizes with the DNA template and thus can protect this strand from APOBEC activity and other types of mutations that act on single-stranded DNA. Indeed, multiple signatures have been found to have mutation strand bias in template versus non-template strands ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOur suggested probabilistic model, StickySig, accounts for the stickiness and strand coordination of mutational signatures. The model captures independent mutations as well as processive groups in one probabilistic framework. In cross-validation tests on multiple datasets, StickySig outperforms independent-mutation models or sticky models that do not account for the strand information. We apply our model to gain new insights about the stickiness and exposures of known signatures, as well as in a   de novo   setting to learn new signatures. \n\n\n## Results and Discussion \n  \n### Mutation Data \n  \nFor each dataset, we followed the standard approach introduced by  ,   and classified mutations into   M  \u00a0= 96 categories based on the 5\u2032 flanking base, substitution type, and 3\u2032 flanking base, following the convention that simple base-pair substitutions can be classified into six subtypes ( A\u20131C). (It is usually not known which base in a pair was the source of a mutation, thus the convention is to annotate substitutions from the pyrimidine base, i.e., G:C > A:T is written as C > T rather than G > A.) These mutations are assumed to be the result of the activity of   K   mutational processes, each of which is associated with a signature   S  =(  e  (1), \u2026,  e  (  M  )) of probabilities to emit each of the mutation categories. Henceforth, we denote the mutation categories observed in a given tumor by   o  , \u2026,  o  . We assume that   o   was emitted by signature   s   (whose identity is hidden from us). \n\nIn addition to mutation categories, the mutation data include information on the reference allele (the nucleotide that is on the Watson strand) and the pyrimidine strand (the Watson or Crick strand containing the pyrimidine base in normal DNA). By convention, the Watson strand is the reference genome strand (the strand whose 5\u2032-end is on the short arm of the chromosome) and the Crick strand is the complementary strand. See  A\u20131C. \n\n\n### Data Description \n  \nWe analyzed breast cancer (BRCA), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLLE), and malignant lymphoma (MALY) mutation datasets from whole-genome sequences from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) (more information is available in the   supplement section). We chose to study BRCA, CLLE, and MALY because they are known to have active signatures (Signatures 2 and 13) that were previously shown to display strand coordination ( ). In addition, each of the corresponding datasets contained at least 100 samples. \n\n\n### A Comparative Evaluation \n  \nWe evaluated our suggested models and compared them with previous approaches using the datasets outlined above ( ). Here MMM serves as a stand-in for state-of-the-art non-probabilistic mutation signature methods such as non-negative matrix factorization, as MMM is a probabilistic method that encodes the standard assumption that each mutation in a tumor is independent of all others. In the  we show that MMM is in fact equivalent to a statistical variant of NMF, which is widely used for mutational signature analysis ( ,  ).   \nDatasets Analyzed in This Study: Breast Cancer (BRCA), Malignant Lymphoma (MALY), and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLLE) \n  \n\nWe performed this comparison in two modes; the first was testing the models in a   refitting   mode when the signatures are known, and the second was testing the models in a   de novo   mode when the signatures are unknown. In the following comparisons, owing to running time considerations, we used a maximum of 100 iterations. \n\nFirst, we focused on the refitting scenario, using the known COSMIC signatures. To this end, we use the leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) method. Specifically, we split samples by chromosomes and learned for each sample   i   the exposure vector   \u03c0   and the stickiness for the cosmic signatures \u03b1 using all the chromosomes but one. We then report the log likelihood of the model on the left-out chromosome (summed across all samples and chromosomes). The results are summarized in   and clearly show the superiority of StickySig across the three cancer types analyzed. In each cancer type, StickySig has higher held-out likelihood than the independent mutation MMM, demonstrating that mutation signatures have stickiness that is shared across samples and that modeling this stickiness provides greater predictive power for held-out data. Furthermore, the difference between the variants of StickySig and MMM becomes much larger when StickySig is restricted to allow stickiness only between mutations with the same reference allele or the same base-pair substitution.   \nPerformance Evaluation of MMM and StickySig Variants in a Refitting Setting Using the Leave-One-Chromosome-Out (LOCO) Method \n    \n\nNext, we study the de novo scenario, where signatures are learned as part of the model training. For comparison purpose, we set the number of signatures to be the same as the number of active COSMIC signatures used above. To evaluate the models with respect to signature learning we used 10-fold sample cross-validation, where we learned   e   and \u03b1 across all samples of the train data; then, for each sample   X   in the test set we fitted \u03c0 and computed Pr[  X  |  \u03c0  ,  e  ,  \u03b1  ] and summed across all samples. This tests the model's capability to produce meaningful signatures that can explain well a new given sample. The results are summarized in   and show again that stickiness adds power to the model. Here again the leading models are StickySig-same-allele and StickySig-same-substitution.   \nPerformance Evaluation of MMM and StickySig Variants in a   De Novo   Setting Using 10-Fold Sample Cross-Validation (CV) \n    \n\nFinally, we wished to assess the signatures learned by the algorithm. We trained the two best performing variants of StickySig (StickySig-same-allele and StickySig-same-substitution) on each of the three datasets. For evaluation purpose, we matched each signature learned by each model to its most similar COSMIC signature known to be active in the corresponding cancer type (measured via cosine similarity). The results are summarized in  . Evidently, StickySig-same-allele yields signatures that are more similar to the COSMIC ones. Note that the definition of signatures in our model is different from the standard one since they are coupled with a stickiness value, which in this application was always one. This may partially explain the deviation (particularly in the same-substitution case) from the COSMIC signatures.   \nSignatures Learning \n\nPerformance of signature learning by StickySig-same-allele (A) and StickySig-same-substitution (B) on the three cancer datasets. For each case, depicted are the cosine similarities of the learned signatures to known COSMIC signatures, sorted from highest to lowest and computed by a maximum matching algorithm to prevent repetitions. \n  \n\n\n### Strand-Coordinated StickySig Defines Processive Groups in Breast Cancers \n  \nMorganella et\u00a0al. defined processive groups as sets of adjacent substitutions of the same mutational signature sharing the same reference allele ( ). Our model, StickySig-same-allele, allows us to compute maximum likelihood estimates that sequences of mutations are generated in processive groups; hence, we could apply it to characterize the processivity of the different signatures in breast cancer. In order to compare and contrast our findings with those of  , we used the same statistical test for the significance of a processive group of a given length. We confirmed the association of processive groups with Signatures 2, 6, 13, 17, and 26 when using the same length threshold of more than 10 ( ). In addition, our strand-coordinated model revealed that processivity is also a feature of Signature 18 ( A). The number of processive groups of length more than 10 was particularly high for Signatures 2 and 13 ( B), which is consistent with previous studies showing that APOBEC-related signatures demonstrated strand-coordinated mutagenesis ( ,  ).   \nStickiness in BRCA \n\n(A) Relationship between processive group lengths (columns) and mutational signatures (rows) modeled by StickySig-same-allele. The size of each circle represents the number of groups (log10) observed for the specified group length and for each signature. The color of each circle corresponds to the p value of detecting a processive group of a given length in randomized data (-log10). \n\n(B) The number of processive groups of length more than 10 for all signatures modeled by MMM (gray), StickySig (blue), and StickySig-same-allele (red). \n\n(C) The total number of mutations can be sticky in StickySig (blue) and StickySig-same-allele (red). \n\n(D) The total number of sticky mutations as modeled by StickySig (blue) and StickySig-same-allele (red). \n\n(E) The number of sticky mutations for each signature as modeled by StickySig (blue) and StickySig-same-allele (red). \n\n(F) Signature stickiness \u03b1 as learned by StickySig (blue) and StickySig-same-allele (red). All bar plots show mean values with standard error of the mean (small black bars) from 10 random initializations of StickySig models. \n  \n\nNext, we tested whether using the strand-coordinated StickySig rather than the mutation-independent MMM or the regular StickySig was important for the accurate discovery of processive groups. On average, the StickySig-same-allele model uncovered 133.9 groups of length greater than 10 in 41.9 patients, whereas MMM and StickySig models captured only 38.5 in 11 patients and 38.3 in 11.9 patients, respectively ( B). This is consistent with the large number of sticky mutations found by StickySig-same-allele model, even though StickySig has more sticky opportunities ( C and 3D). All these differences underscore the higher sensitivity of the strand-coordinated model for detecting processive groups, which may in part explain the observed differences in likelihood between MMM and StickySig models on held-out data ( ). \n\nProcessive groups, as summarized in  A and 3B, capture statistically significant patterns in cancer genomes and are considered features of specific signatures. An alternative characterization signature could be provided by the model parameter \u03b1\u2014the \u201cstickiness\u201d of a signature\u2014which is learned by the strand-coordinated model. Thus, we analyzed how these two views of strand-coordinated mutagenesis relate to each other. We considered only signatures for which there is a sufficient number of sticky mutations to properly learn this parameter ( E). For comparison purposes, we also included stickiness values computed with the strand-oblivious StickySig. We found that, in the strand-coordinated variant, the most sticky signatures were 1, 2, 6, 13, 17, 18, 26, and 30 ( F). Signatures 2, 6, 13, 17, 18, and 26 are exactly the same signatures that were found to be associated with processive groups. Although Signature 30 did not make the length 10 cutoff for processive groups, its processive segments are also relatively long. Interestingly Signatures 3 and 5 were not found to be sticky despite the fact that their processive groups were also quite long. In contrast, there is some stickiness to Signature 1 while its processive groups are shorter than for 3, 5, and 30. The signature stickiness in the strand-oblivious StickySig model is minimal. The meaning of these intriguing findings is a subject for further investigation. \n\n\n### Limitations of the Study \n  \nAlthough in this work we focused on Watson/Crick strands, there is compelling evidence that other strand definitions may affect signatures and their activities. As we reviewed above, such categorization may be based on replication-based characteristics such as leading and lagging or transcription-based characteristics such as template and non-template. In that vein, a promising next step may be modeling multiple strand characteristics simultaneously, rather than considering them individually. For example, there is evidence in humans and other species that transcription and replication are co-oriented ( ,  ). Testing these different variants may reveal the role of strand characteristics in mutagenesis. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \nAll methods can be found in the accompanying  . \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7038582, "text_md5": "e29b4db30aa56a7089f2ad1d5b393aeb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 122], "journal": [123, 131], "publication_year": [133, 137], "title": [148, 235], "keywords": [249, 293], "abstract": [306, 1694], "body": [1703, 19790]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32088392, "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2020.100900", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7038582", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7038582"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7038582\">7038582</a>", "list_title": "PMC7038582  A Sticky Multinomial Mixture Model of Strand-Coordinated Mutational Processes in Cancer"}

PC is caused by mutations in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B  ,   KRT6C  ,   KRT16  , and   KRT17  , a set of keratin genes expressed in the nail bed, palmoplantar epidermis, oral mucosal epithelium, hair follicle and sweat gland. RNA-seq analysis revealed that all PC-associated keratins (except for   Krt6c   that does exist in the mouse genome) are expressed in the mouse enamel organ. We further demonstrated that these keratins are produced by ameloblasts and are incorporated into mature human enamel. Using genetic and intraoral examination data from 573 adults and 449 children, we identified several missense polymorphisms in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   that lead to a higher risk for dental caries. Structural analysis of teeth from a PC patient carrying a p.Asn171Lys substitution in keratin-6a (K6a) revealed disruption of enamel rod sheaths resulting in altered rod shape and distribution. Finally, this PC-associated substitution as well as more frequent caries-associated SNPs, found in two of the   KRT6   genes, that result in p.Ser143Asn substitution (rs28538343 in   KRT6B   and rs151117600 in   KRT6C  ), alter the assembly of K6 filaments in ameloblast-like cells. These results identify a new set of keratins involved in tooth enamel formation, distinguish novel susceptibility loci for tooth decay and reveal additional clinical features of pachyonychia congenita. \n   Author summary  \nTooth decay, more commonly known as dental cavities, is the most common chronic disease worldwide, both in children and in adults. It consists in the destruction of tooth enamel, the outer layer of the teeth, by acid-producing bacteria. Enamel is the hardest tissue in the body, comprised of 96% minerals. However, it contains a small fraction of proteins that is important for its resistance to mechanical stress and decay. Here we show that this protein fraction contains a set of structural proteins (K6a, K6b, K6c, K16 and K17) that belong to the keratin family and are present specifically in the skin of the palms and soles, as well as in nails. We further show that common genetic mutations that affect the composition of these proteins lead to an increased number of cavities. Rare mutations in these keratins lead to a human disease called pachyonychia congenita (PC) and characterized by severe nail malformations and lesions in the skin of the palms and soles. Analysis of wisdom teeth from one of these patients showed that their enamel exhibited structural defects. These results demonstrate that these keratins are important components of tooth enamel and that common genetic variants in the genes that encode them influence tooth decay risk in the general population. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTooth enamel is made of 96% hydroxyapatite minerals, which makes it the hardest tissue in the human body. Enamel is also the first compartment of the tooth to be attacked by dental caries, a chronic disease that affects 42% of children and 92% of adults, with various degrees of severity (number of teeth and tooth surfaces affected) in the general population. Dental caries is initiated at the surface of the tooth by bacteria metabolizing food residues and releasing acids that dissolve enamel minerals [ ]. Even though dental caries is influenced by environmental and behavioral factors, there is clear evidence that susceptibility to caries is also driven by host genetic factors [ \u2013 ], and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to tooth decay [ \u2013 ]. These genetic factors may influence the quality of dental tissues and ability to resist carious attacks, may impact other aspects of the oral environment such as the quality of the saliva, enamel pellicle and oral microbiome, and may differ between the primary and permanent dentitions [ ]. \n\nTooth enamel is produced in two phases [ ]: first, a secretion phase during which enamel matrix proteins are secreted and deposited in a highly structured manner to form enamel rods; and second, a maturation phase during which most enamel matrix proteins are degraded to make space for the full expansion of hydroxyapatite minerals. After maturation, the enamel is left with only 1% of proteins that are abundant near the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) and expand throughout the enamel as thin layers of enamel rod sheaths located at the interrod region [ ]. This organic material has been shown to play a crucial role in the biomechanical properties of enamel [ ,  ] and in the resistance to caries [ ,  ]. Until recently, the exact composition of the insoluble fraction in this organic material had been uncharacterized, even though there was strong evidence that the highly crosslinked proteins present in mature enamel had biochemical properties similar to those of keratins [ ,  \u2013 ]. We showed previously that the organic material in mature enamel is in part composed of epithelial hair keratins, and that missense mutations in   KRT75  , previously linked to common hair disorders, were associated with increased susceptibility to dental caries [ ]. \n\nIn the present study, we focus on the presence in enamel of another set of keratins encoded by genes mutated in pachyonychia congenita (PC), a cutaneous disorder characterized by nail dystrophy and painful palmoplantar keratoderma [ ,  ]. Additional features of this disease may include oral leukokeratosis, follicular keratosis, cysts, hyperhidrosis, and natal teeth. Some of these phenotypic traits are consistent with the expression pattern of the keratins involved. Herein we present novel findings that relate this set of keratins to the development of tooth enamel and to the susceptibility to tooth decay. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Pachyonychia congenita-associated keratins are produced by ameloblasts and incorporated into mature tooth enamel \n  \nIn a previous study, we determined through RNA-seq analysis that subsets of epithelial keratins were expressed in the enamel organ in mouse [ ]. Of particular interest was the expression of   Krt6a  ,   Krt6b  ,   Krt16   and   Krt17   (   ), a set of keratin genes encoding keratin-6a (K6a), keratin-6b (K6b), keratin-16 (K16) and keratin-17 (K17), respectively, and in which mutations in humans lead to pachyonychia congenita (PC-K6a, OMIM #615726; PC-K6b, OMIM #615728; PC-K16, OMIM #167200; PC-K17, OMIM #167210), characterized by nail dystrophy and painful palmoplantar keratoderma [ ,  ]. In humans, the   KRT6   family includes a third member (  KRT6C  , encoding K6c), mutations in which have been associated with a milder form of PC with no/minor nail defects (PC-K6c) that was initially reported as palmoplantar keratoderma, non-epidermolytic, focal or diffuse (PPKNEFD, OMIM #615735). \n   K6 proteins in enamel and genetic association between missense SNPs in   KRT6   genes and tooth decay experience.  \n(  A  ) RNA-seq data from mouse enamel organ showing expression of   Krt6a  ,   Krt6b  ,   Krt16   and   Krt17   in the tissue. The schematics at the top shows a mouse mandible at postnatal day 10 from which the enamel organ (red) was micro-dissected for RNA extraction. Tracks represent the alignment of the RNA-seq reads to the mouse genome for the   Krt6a  ,   Krt6b  ,   Krt16   and   Krt17   loci. (  B  ) Immunohistochemical analysis of K6 distribution in rat enamel organ at postnatal day 10. Anti-K6 antibody recognizes all members of the K6 family (K6a and K6b in rodents). Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Inset at the top shows enlarged view of Tomes\u2019 processes.

(  C  ) Immunohistochemical detection of K6 on polished sections of human third molars. Antibody raised in guinea pig against the N-terminal of K6 (recognizes K6a, K6b and K6c in humans) was used (green). As indicated by the schematics on the bottom right corner, the image in the left panel was acquired from mesial-distal sections of human third molars and shows the area of enamel adjacent to dentin, whereas the image in the right panel was acquired from transverse section of the crown near the cusps. DEJ, dentin-enamel junction. Scale bars: 100 \u03bcm for left panel, 20 \u03bcm for right panel. (  D  ) Schematics showing the structure of keratin proteins with a central rod domain flanked by a head domain and a tail domain. Shown in red are the position of the five missense SNPs in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   that were found to have significant genetic association with tooth decay risk as measured by three indices of dental caries experience. All SNPs associated with high caries experience in adults resulted in substitutions in the head domain of K6 proteins, while the unique SNP that showed association with tooth decay risk in children only results in a substitution in the tail domain of K6b (Y497C). Areas where mutations leading to PC have so far been identified are highlighted by black arrowheads and are exclusively at the beginning and at the end of the rod domain. (  E  ) Linkage disequilibrium data measured by R  between the five missense polymorphisms highlighted in D. \n  \nImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that K6 (using an antibody recognizing all K6 proteins) and K17 are produced by rodent ameloblasts but exhibit very distinct distributions (   and   ). K6 distribution is relatively diffuse in secretory ameloblasts (   ) while K17 forms characteristic keratin filaments that run throughout the ameloblasts and underlying tissues (stratum intermedium and papillary layer) (   ). At the apex of the ameloblasts and outside the Tomes\u2019 processes, highly specialized structures where the deposition of enamel is coordinated, K6 was detected primarily at the interrod region (  , magnification top panel  ). In the same area, K17 staining resulted in parallel transverse bands within the rods in addition to a longitudinal interrod distribution similar to that obtained with K6 staining (  , magnification top panel  ). These distributions indicate that K6 and K17 are both incorporated into the enamel matrix but with distinct patterns. To determine whether these keratins were part of the organic material present in mature human enamel, we performed immunohistochemical staining on polished sections of human third molars (   and   ). Consistent with its distribution near the apex of rodent ameloblasts, K6 was detected primarily where the enamel rod sheaths are located, at the periphery of the enamel rods (   ). More intense staining was detected at regular intervals near the DEJ, along structures that are likely to correspond to enamel tufts, areas of higher accumulation of organic material (  , left panel  ). In addition to intense staining near the DEJ, K6 was detected throughout the thickness of enamel and restricted to the periphery of the rods (  , right panel  ). K16 and K17 were detected near the DEJ where they were not restricted to the interrod regions but also present in the core of the rods (   ), a pattern consistent with the distribution of K17 near the apex of rodent ameloblasts. The restricted pattern of K6 distribution at the enamel rod sheaths was confirmed with two different antibodies, a polyclonal antibody raised in guinea-pig against the C-terminus of the protein and a monoclonal antibody raised in mouse against the N-terminus (   ). These results indicate that PC-associated keratins are part of the organic material present in mature enamel but exhibit distinct distributions. \n\n\n### Several missense SNPs in   KRT6   genes are associated with susceptibility to dental caries in a dentition-dependent manner (primary vs. permanent) \n  \nIn order to determine if the presence of K6a, K6b, K6c, K16 and K17 in mature human enamel had an impact on the susceptibility to tooth decay, we tested the association between SNPs in the genes encoding these keratins and three measures of dental caries experience assessed in the primary dentition of 449 children (mixed European descent, 6\u201312 years) and permanent dentition of 573 adults (mixed European descent, 25\u201350 years). We focused our attention to common missense SNPs that occur at a sufficient frequency (minor allele frequency > 1%) allowing for statistical testing in our unselected population-based cohort. Three missense SNPs in   KRT6A  , eight in   KRT6C  , and seven in   KRT6B   responded to these criteria (   ). Across all 18 missense SNPs, seven SNPs showed nominal evidence of association (p < 0.05) with at least one measure of dental caries experience in either adults or children, and the following five SNPs exhibited associations with all three measures of dental caries experience (   ): \n  \n KRT6A  :  c  .  61A>G   (rs17845411) leading to p.Asn21Ser (K6a ). \n  \n KRT6C  :  c  .  428G>A   (rs151117600) leading to p.Ser143Asn (K6c ). \n  \n KRT6B  :  c  .  289G>A   (rs144860693) leading to p.Gly97Arg (K6b ). \n  \n KRT6B  :  c  .  428G>A   (rs28538343) leading to p.Ser143Asn (K6b ). \n  \n KRT6B  :  c  .  1490A>G   (rs61746354) leading to p.Tyr497Cys (K6b ). \n     Genetic association of missense SNPs in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   with dental caries in permanent dentition of adults (N = 573, 25\u201350 years) and primary dentition of children (N = 449, 6\u201312 years).        \nThe SNPs identified in   KRT6A   and   KRT6C   were associated with increased caries experience in adults only. Among the missense polymorphisms identified in   KRT6B  , rs61746354 (K6b ) was associated with higher caries experience in children, while rs144860693 (K6b ) and rs28538343 (K6b ) were associated with higher caries experience in adults (   ). These results indicate that the effect of specific polymorphisms in keratin genes may differ across dentition (primary vs. permanent). \n\nOnly one common missense SNP in   KRT16  , rs111383277 (  KRT16  :  c  .  121C>T;   K16p.Arg41Cys), was at a frequency higher than 1%, while none were found in   KRT17  . rs111383277 did not show significant association with dental caries experience in the cohorts tested. Due to this limited number of common SNPs in   KRT16   and   KRT17  , we were not able to conclude on the potential implication of these two keratins in caries risk. \n\n\n### Caries-associated missense SNPs in   KRT6   genes result in substitutions in the head and tail domains of the proteins \n  \nKeratins are structured into three major domains with a central \u201crod\u201d domain, directly involved in the dimerization and further assembly of keratin filaments, flanked by a \u201chead\u201d domain and a \u201ctail\u201d domain on the N-terminal side and C-terminal side, respectively (   ). Interestingly, all the missense polymorphisms that showed significant association with higher caries experience in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   result in amino acid substitutions in the head or tail domains, while all the mutations that have been associated so far with PC are located at the beginning or at the end of the rod domain (   ). The   KRT6B   polymorphism associated with higher caries experience in children (rs61746354, K6b ) is the only SNP that results in an amino acid substitution in the tail domain (   ). The missense SNPs in   KRT6   genes were present at various frequencies in the cohorts studied (   ). Moderate to high linkage disequilibrium (R  between 0.69 and 0.89) was observed between rs17845411 (K6a ), rs151117600 (K6c ), rs144860693 (K6b ), and rs28538343 (K6b ) (   ). \n\nGenotype frequencies and quantifications of caries experience per genotype group for the three missense SNPs identified in   KRT6B   are shown in    . The frequencies of rs144860693 (K6b ) and rs28538343 (K6b ), the two variants that exhibited the most significant association with dental caries risk in adults, are high in the cohorts studied (  ;   ). These two SNPs have a major impact on caries experience, with an estimated increase in the average number of carious tooth surfaces of 1.6 and 2.4 surfaces per copy of the risk allele, respectively (   ). These variants did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect on average caries experience in children (   ). rs61746354 (K6b ), the missense SNP in   KRT6B   that was associated with higher caries risk in children and occurs at a frequency higher that 4% in our cohorts (   ), was associated with an estimated 1-surface increase in the average number of carious tooth surfaces (   and   ). Genotype frequencies and quantifications of caries experience per genotype for the other missense SNPs identified in   KRT6A   and KRT6  C   are shown in    . \n   Genetic association between missense SNPs in   KRT6B   and tooth decay experience.  \nGenotype frequencies and quantification of caries experience per genotype for missense SNPs rs144860693 (  A  ), rs28538343 (  B  ) and rs61746354 (  C  ). Pie charts on the left show the frequencies of all three genotypes for each SNP in the cohorts of 573 adults and 449 children that were evaluated for their caries experience. Bar graphs on the right represent the average and SEM (error bar) measures of three indices standardly used to assess caries experience: left, the number of tooth surfaces with untreated decay (DS and ds); center, the number of decayed, missing due to decay, and filled surfaces (DMFS and dfs); right, partial DMFS and dfs indices limited to molars and premolars pit and fissure surfaces (PF_DMFS and pf_dfs). \n  \n\n### Statistically significant interaction effects are observed between caries-associated missense SNPs in   KRT6   genes \n  \nGiven that   KRT6B   harbors three missense SNPs showing significant association with caries experience, we wanted to further quantify the genetic relationship of missense variants in this gene on dental caries. To do so, we examined pairwise interactions between rs144860693 (K6b ), rs28538343 (K6b ) and rs61746354 (K6b ). Statistically significant interaction effects were observed between rs144860693 (K6b ) and rs28538343 (K6b ) on the number of surfaces with untreated decay (DS) model, between rs144860693 (K6b ) and rs61746354 (K6b ), and rs28538343 (K6b ) and rs61746354 (K6b ) on the number of decayed, missing due to decay, and filled surfaces (DMFS), adjusting for age, sex, and all the other SNPs in   KRT6B   (   ). Even though rs61746354 (K6b ) was associated with higher caries risk in children only, this SNP exhibited a significant statistical interaction effect with rs144860693 (K6b ) and rs28538343 (K6b ) in adults (   ). Therefore, the effect of the two SNPs that result in amino acid substitutions in the head domain of K6b on caries risk in adults may be influenced by the presence or absence of the p.Tyr497Cys substitution in the tail domain of the same keratin, a SNP that by itself is associated to higher caries risk only in children. The two SNPs resulting in p.Ser143Asn substitution in   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   (rs28538343 and rs151117600, respectively) also exhibited statistically significant interaction effect on the number of surfaces with untreated decay (DS) in adults (p-value = 0.044). When focusing on the 4 SNPs that lead to higher caries risk in adults, we found a significant cumulative effect of the number of risk alleles on caries experience (   ). \n\nGiven that   KRT75   is adjacent and phylogenetically related to the   KRT6   genes in the human genome, we explored potential linkage disequilibrium and interaction effects between the   KRT75   SNP previously shown to increase caries experience in adults [ ] and the newly identified SNPs in   KRT6   genes. The previously reported SNP rs2232387 (K75 ) was not in linkage disequilibrium with any of the   KRT6   SNPs (   ) and there was no statistical interaction (all p-values >0.05) between the same SNPs. \n\nAltogether, our data support genetic association between SNPs in   KRT6A  ,   KRT6B   and   KRT6C   and tooth decay risk, in a way that is dentition-specific, and with statistical interaction between various loci in these three genes. \n\n\n### PC patient with mutation in   KRT6A   exhibits structural enamel defects \n  \nIn order to assess how mutations in   KRT6   genes may affect enamel structure, we analyzed third molars that were extracted from a PC patient who is heterozygous for the   KRT6A  :  c  .  513C>A   transversion that results in p.Asn171Lys amino acid substitution (K6a ) (   ). This patient is a white male who was 18 years old at the time his third molars were extracted, and is the member of a family in which the mutation in   KRT6A   was previously reported [ ]. The patient experienced 20/20 nail dystrophy, very painful palmoplantar keratoderma, oral leukokeratosis, follicular keratosis, but did not have natal teeth. The overall shape and structure of the third molar enamel did not appear defective based on micro-computed tomography analysis (   ). However, scanning electron microscopy analysis of polished sections of the teeth (section plane transverse to the enamel rods) revealed alteration of the distribution and shape of enamel rods when compared to third molars extracted from healthy patients (   ). \n   Structural enamel defects in third molars from a patient with PC-causing mutation in   KRT6A  .  \n(  A  ) Chromatograph on the left shows wild type sequence of   KRT6A   exon 1 at position c.505\u2013519. Chromatograph on the right shows equivalent region for a PC patient with heterozygous mutation c.513C>A leading to missense mutation p.Asn171Lys (K6a ). Schematics in lower panel shows the position of the N171K amino acid substitution at the beginning of the rod domain in K6a. (  B  ) Micro-computed tomography analysis of a wisdom tooth extracted from a PC patient who is heterozygous for the mutation described in A.

(  D  ) Differential interference contrast imaging of insoluble organic material isolated from a third molar from PC and control patients. White arrowheads indicate curls formed by the rod sheaths. Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm. (  E  ) Immunohistochemical detection of K6 (red) on polished section of human third molar extracted from PC and control patients. White arrowheads indicate aggregates. Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm. DEJ, dentin-enamel junction. \n  \nThe insoluble organic material present in mature enamel can be isolated after full demineralization of a tooth in EDTA. When isolated from molars extracted from this PC patient, the insoluble material exhibited uneven alignment of the enamel rod sheaths that tended to form curls (   ). To assess the effects of the K6a  mutant protein on K6 distribution in enamel, we performed immunohistochemical staining using anti-K6 antibody on polished sections of the patient\u2019s tooth. K6 staining was still found to be stronger in the tuft areas near the DEJ (   ). However, K6 distribution was no longer restricted to the interrod but could also be found as smaller rings or clumps within rods (   ). These results indicate that this PC-causing mutation in   KRT6A   leads to improper incorporation of the K6a protein into enamel rod sheaths, which results in altered shape and arrangement of enamel rods. \n\n\n### Caries-associated p.Ser143Asn and p.Tyr497Cys substitutions alter K6 protein behavior in ameloblast-like cells \n  \nMissense mutations in keratins may affect their assembly, modify their subcellular localization and/or affect their interaction with keratin-associated proteins. Phosphorylation and glycosylation of the head and tail domain of intermediate filaments proteins have been shown to influence their interaction with other proteins and their subcellular localization [ ,  ]. When comparing the position of the SNPs we determined to be associated with increased caries experience and potential sites for post-translational modifications in K6 proteins, we observed that the p.Ser143Asn substitution (rs28538343 in   KRT6B   and rs151117600 in   KRT6C  ) is immediately adjacent to an LL / PL consensus phosphorylation site that is highly conserved in type II keratins [ ,  ], and within a potential N-linked glycosylation site (   and   ). Although it remains to be determined how K6 proteins interact with and are deposited into the enamel matrix in the context of a secretory stage ameloblast   in vivo  , we assessed the effect of the p.Ser143Asn substitution in K6 in a context in which the mutant protein is overexpressed in ameloblast-like cells (ALC) [ ]. In this assay, we also analyzed the behavior of K6  mutant protein carried by the PC patient included in this study (   ), a mutation located in the rod domain and known to have a severe effect on keratin filament assembly [ ,  ]. Given the high degree of sequence identity between K6 proteins (   ) and the fact that the mutations of interest are located in highly conserved regions (   ), we used K6a as a model protein for this assay. We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the   c  .  428G>A   transition (results in p.Ser143Asn substitution) and the   c  .  513C>A   transversion (results in p.Asn171Lys substitution) into the   KRT6A   cDNA, and cloned the different isoforms (  KRT6A  ,   KRT6A   and   KRT6A  ) into a vector that allows for tetracycline inducible co-expression of   KRT6A   isoforms and   GFP   (   ). \n   Effects of S143N and N171K mutations on the assembly of K6a in ameloblast-like cells.  \n(  A  ) Alignment of K6a, K6b and K6c protein sequences between amino acids 138 and 175 showing the position of serine 143 and asparagine 171 on both sides of the transition between the head and the rod domain (black box labeled HR). Serine 143 is right upstream of an LL  /  PL consensus phosphorylation site (blue circle labeled   P  ) that is highly conserved in type II keratins. Serine 143 is also part of an   N  QSL potential N-glycosylation site (green circle labeled   G  ). (  B  ) Schematic representation of pBi4-GFP/K6a bidirectional constructs used for tetracycline inducible expression of GFP with   KRT6A  ,   KRT6A   (produces K6a ) or   KRT6A   (produces K6a  mutant). When transfected into cells expressing the transactivator rTA, transgene expression through binding of rTA to the tetracycline responsive element (TRE) can be induced by addition of doxycycline (Dox) to the culture medium. (  C  ) Detection of GFP induction in ameloblasts-like cells stably expressing rTA (ALC-TetON) transfected with pBi4-GFP/K6a constructs and grown with or without Dox. (  D  ) Immunohistochemical analysis of K6a subcellular distribution (red) in ALC-TetON cells producing K6a , K6a  or K6a . Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue) and actin filaments are stained with phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (white). \n  \nThese constructs were used to transfect ALC-TetON cells in which expression of   KRT6A   isoforms and   GFP   can be induced by addition of doxycycline to the culture medium (   ). Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-K6 antibody was used to determine the distribution of K6a isoforms in ALC-TetON cells (   ). While K6a  formed thick and relatively short bundles of keratin filaments in ALC-TetON cells, K6a  tended to form a web of thinner filaments together with large aggregates (   ). These large aggregates were not seen with K6a proteins harboring the p.Asn21Ser and p.Gly97Arg substitutions ( ) caused by the other SNPs that are associated with higher caries in adults (rs17845411 and rs144860693, respectively) and are in partial linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs leading to p.Ser143Asn substitution (rs28538343 in   KRT6B   and rs151117600 in   KRT6C  ). These results suggest that the p.Ser143Asn substitution may contribute most significantly to the caries-prone phenotype in adults. The behavior of the K6a  mutant protein fused to a YFP tag has been previously studied in the context of human hepatoma PLC cells in which the mutant protein was shown to form aggregates primarily located in the cytoplasm [ ,  ]. In the context of ALC-TetON cells, K6a  formed aggregates that showed heightened accumulation in the nucleus (   ). These results confirm a severe impairment of K6a assembly in PC patients with p.Asn171Lys substitution. The fact that the aggregates in PLC cells were mostly in the cytoplasm may reflect a cell-specific behavior of the mutant protein or may be due to the YFP tag that was fused to K6a in these experiments [ ,  ]. \n\nGiven that the SNP leading to p.Tyr497Cys substitution in the tail domain of K6b (rs61746354) is the only one we found associated with higher caries risk in children, we tested its effect on K6a assembly. Similarly to K6a , the K6a  isoform tended to form large aggregates in ALC-TetON cells ( ), which suggests that this SNP may be the cause of the caries-prone phenotype in children. Even though this substitution is not found near a potential posttranslational modification site, the presence of a new cysteine in the tail domain may result in the formation of disruptive disulfide bonds. Given the interaction effects measured between the SNPs that lead to the p.Ser143Asn and p.Tyr497Cys substitutions, we generated a DNA construct for the expression of a K6a protein that harbors both substitutions (K6a ). This double mutant tends to form aggregates to the same extent as the single mutant proteins ( ). \n\nTaken together, these results confirm that the PC-associated p.Asn171Lys substitution results in profound impairment of K6a protein assembly, and reveal that the caries-associated p.Ser143Asn and p.Tyr497Cys substitutions in K6 proteins also affect the behavior of the proteins, when overexpressed in an ameloblast cell line. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present report highlights the contribution of specific sets of keratins to the organic fraction of mature tooth enamel and demonstrates through genetic and analytical studies their crucial function in the formation of enamel and its resistance to decay. K75, an epithelial hair keratin in which mutations have been associated with hair disorders, was the first keratin we investigated in this context [ ]. K6 proteins, that are the focus of the present study, are expressed in epithelia that withstand particularly high levels of mechanical strain (palmoplantar skin, oral epithelium) as well as in the supporting layers of the hair follicle where their function is similar to that of K75 which is not expressed in palmoplantar epidermis and oral epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that, as K75, K6 proteins play a crucial role in the enamel rod sheath and that mutations in the genes encoding these keratins may impair the stability of the organic structural component of mature enamel. We propose that, with their unique biochemical properties, K75 and K6 contribute to the toughness, elasticity and resistance to degradation of the enamel rod sheaths, which contributes to establishing proper shape and arrangement of enamel rods and enhances the biomechanical properties of tooth enamel [ ,  ]. Moreover, since it has long been suggested that the stability of the proteins in mature enamel influences the resistance of enamel to carious attack [ ,  ], we propose that keratins contribute to the stability of enamel rod sheaths and therefore to the resistance of enamel to decay. \n\nSince K6 proteins are also expressed in the oral epithelium, and patients with PC may exhibit oral leukokeratosis, there could be a partial involvement of the oral cavity in the increased susceptibility to caries measured in this study. However, the fact that we found SNPs that lead to a higher number of caries in children and not in adults (same oral cavity but different set of teeth) strongly suggests that defects in the dental tissue itself are the major factor leading to this effect. The structure and chemical composition of tooth enamel is known to be different between primary and permanent teeth. Primary teeth exhibit thinner and whiter enamel with a smoother surface and higher content in calcium and phosphate when compared to permanent teeth [ ,  ]. Enamel from primary teeth also has a greater susceptibility to demineralization [ ]. Moreover, it has been proposed that the genetic factors influencing dental caries differ between primary and permanent dentition [ ]. However, there has been no study comparing the composition of the organic material present in the enamel from primary and permanent teeth. The dentition-specific effect we report here for SNPs in KRT6 genes, which we previously observed for two SNPs in   KRT75  , with one affecting adults and the other one affecting children [ ], suggests that the combination and/or the mode of incorporation of these keratins in the enamel rod sheaths is different in primary and permanent teeth. \n\nEven though this is the first evidence of K6 proteins being incorporated into the enamel matrix, a previous yeast-two-hybrid study determined that K6 could interact with enamel matrix proteins such as amelogenin and tuftelin [ ]. It is therefore likely that K6 proteins interact with enamel matrix proteins during the process of enamel secretion. However, the mode of incorporation of keratins into the enamel matrix remains to be elucidated. The interaction of keratins with other proteins is known to involve their head and tail domains rather than the rod domain through which heterodimerization of acidic and basic keratins is established. These interactions are regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation [ ,  ], and mutations impairing such modifications have been linked to skin diseases [ ], as well as diseases related to liver and pancreatic injury [ ]. Interestingly, all the caries-associated missense SNPs we identified in   KRT6   genes result in substitutions in the head and tail domains of the proteins, which suggests that they may affect their interaction with other proteins rather than their heterodimerization. We further demonstrate that the p.Ser143Asn substitution that may affect phosphorylation and/or glycosylation of the head domain of K6 proteins affects the behavior of K6A in the context of an ameloblast cell line, which suggests that this substitution found in both K6b and K6c may contribute most significantly to the caries-prone phenotype in adults. Functional studies will be required to elucidate the effects of the p.Ser143Asn substitution on the biochemical properties of K6 proteins, in particular on its ability to undergo posttranslational modifications that may affect interaction with enamel matrix proteins and incorporation into the enamel   in vivo  . Interestingly, in a recent clinical report, an isolated case of PC was proposed to be caused by de novo c.428G>A mutation in   KRT6A   that leads to the p.Ser143Asn substitution [ ]. This is so far the only report of PC-causing mutation outside of the rod domain. Based on its location in the head domain and on the high frequency of the same substitution in K6b and K6c, the p.Ser143Asn substitution in K6a is unlikely to be the sole cause for the PC phenotype in this patient. \n\nIn epidermal tissues, K6 proteins (Type II, basic or neutral) form heterodimers with K16 or K17 (Type I, acidic) to assemble in larger polymeric structures. Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of K16 and K17 proteins is distinct from the distribution of K6 in the enamel organ, which suggests that they do not follow their canonical mode of assembly in this tissue. Due to the low number of frequent missense SNPs in   KRT16   and   KRT17   in our cohorts, the present study did not allow us to make any conclusion on the potential genetic association between variants in these two genes and dental caries experience. However, the striking difference in the way K16 and K17 proteins are incorporated into enamel suggests that their function in this tissue is distinct from that of K6 proteins. Based on the restricted localization of K16 and K17 near the DEJ and in the core of the enamel rods, these keratins may be involved in shock absorption and protection against fracture [ ] rather than in the resistance to caries. Structural analysis of enamel from PC patients with mutations in   KRT16   and   KRT17   will help address this question. \n\nIn conclusion, we show for the first time that (i) K6 proteins are incorporated into mature tooth enamel at the rod sheaths, (ii) SNPs in   KRT6   genes are associated with increased susceptibility to dental caries, (iii) a PC patient with a mutation in   KRT6A   exhibits defects in enamel structure, and (iv) caries-associated p.Ser143Asn substitution in K6 proteins impairs proper protein interactions. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nWe thank the Pachyonychia Congenita Project and Ms. Holly Evans for providing us with clinical information and extracted third molars from a PC patient (20040468\u20131057496), and the NIDCR dental clinic for providing extracted third molars from healthy patients (NCT01805869). \n\nFor the COHRA study, written informed consent was provided by all adult participants, and verbal assent with parental written consent was provided by all child participants. All procedures, forms and protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University. \n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the pachyonychia congenita patient, as part of a research registry approved by an institutional review board that complies with all principles of the Helsinki Accord (Western IRB study no. 20040468). \n\nAll animal work was approved by the NIAMS Animal Care and Use Committee. \n\n\n### Human subject recruitment for the COHRA study \n  \nThe Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA) study was initiated to investigate the community-, family-, and individual-level contributors to oral health [ ]. Participants from rural counties of Pennsylvania and West Virginia were enrolled via a household-based recruitment strategy, with eligible households required to include at least one biological parent-child pair. All other members of eligible households were invited to participate without regard to biological or legal relationships, or oral health status. Written informed consent was provided by all adult participants, and verbal assent with parental written consent was provided by all child participants. All procedures, forms and protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University. \n\n\n### Data collection for the COHRA study \n  \nIntra-oral examinations of all participants were performed by licensed dentists and/or research dental hygienists. Each surface of each tooth (excluding third molars) was examined for evidence of decay, from which dental caries indices were generated. Three measurements of caries experience were considered: (1) the number of surfaces with untreated decay (DS/ds); (2) the traditional DMFS/dfs indices which represent the number of decayed (D/d), missing due to decay (M), and filled (F/f) tooth surfaces (S/s) in the permanent (DMFS) and primary (dfs) dentitions; and (3) the partial DMFS and dfs indices limited to the molars and premolar pit and fissure surfaces which are at high risk of decay. DNA samples were collected via blood, saliva or buccal swab. Genotyping for approximately 600,000 polymorphisms was performed by the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University using the Illumina Human610-Quadv1_B BeadChip (Illumina). Extensive data cleaning and quality assurance analyses were performed as previously reported [ ]. Imputation of approximately 16 million unobserved genetic variants was performed using the 1000 Genome Project (phase 1 June 2011 release) as reference. In brief, pre-phasing of haplotypes was performed via SHAPEIT2 [ ] and imputation was performed via IMPUTE2 [ ]. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis for the COHRA study \n  \nLinear regression was used to test the association of dental caries experience with genetic polymorphisms under the additive genetic model while adjusting for age and sex. Pairwise SNP-by-SNP interaction effects were tested in the same modeling framework by including main effects of each SNP and their product term for selected variants within the same gene region, along with age and sex. Analyses were performed separately for dental caries in the permanent dentition of adults (ages 25\u201350 years) and the primary dentition of children (ages 6\u201312 years). All analyses were limited to self-reported non-Hispanic whites (mixed European descent); self-reported race was consistent with genetically-determined ancestry. Analyses were performed using PLINK (v1.9) ( )[ ] and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). \n\n\n### Collection of third molars from patient with pachyonychia congenita \n  \nThird molars were obtained from a patient involved in the International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry (IPCRR), under the IRB Protocol number 20040468 and IRB Study number 1057496. Third molars from healthy patients were obtained from the NIDCR OP-1 Dental Clinic that were collected under the IRB Protocol number NCT01805869. \n\n\n### RNA-seq analysis \n  \nRNA-seq analysis was performed as described previously [ ]. Briefly, mandibles were dissected from P10 mice, transferred to RNAlater solution (Life Technologies) and stored at 4\u00b0C. Enamel organs were dissected from mandibles and homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) using the Precellys 24 (Bertin Technologies). Total RNA was extracted and further purified using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq analysis was performed using the Mondrian SP kit (Illumina) and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system. \n\n\n### Immunohistochemical analysis on rat mandible section \n  \nRat mandibles at postnatal day 10 were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and 10 \u03bcm-thick sections were prepared. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using a blocking solution containing 5% goat serum and 7.5% BlockHen II (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR) in 1X PBS. Enzymatic antigen retrieval was performed using Ultravision Trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA). Primary antibodies used: Guinea-pig anti-K6 (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Germany), guinea-pig anti-K17 (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Germany). Alexa-488 anti-guinea-pig (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) was used as secondary antibody. Images were acquired on a Leica LS5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). \n\n\n### Immunohistochemical analysis on polished human tooth sections \n  \nGround, polished and etched human teeth were stained with guinea-pig anti-K6 (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Germany), mouse anti-K6 (Abcam, Cambridge MA), guinea-pig anti-K16 (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Germany) or guinea-pig anti-K17 (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Germany) antibody. Alexa-488 anti-guinea-pig and Alexa-555 anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) were used as secondary antibodies. \n\n\n### Scanning electron microscopy \n  \nGround, polished and etched human teeth were prepared for SEM as described previously [ ]. Samples were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% PFA in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and dehydrated through a series of 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions. They were incubated for 10 min in hexamethyldisilazane, air-dried for 30 min, mounted on aluminum specimen mount stubs covered with conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), sputter-coated with gold and analyzed under a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope S4800 (Hitashi, Toronto, Canada) at 10 kV. \n\n\n### Micro-CT analysis and 3-D reconstructions \n  \nMicro-CT analysis of fixed molars was performed as described previously [ ] using the Skyscan 1172 desktop X-ray microfocus CT scanner and the following parameters: 0.5mm AI + 0.1mm Cu filters, 100 kV, 100 uA, 8.00 micron resolution, 0.4 degrees rotation step over 180 degrees). CTvox software (Bruker microCT) was used for 3D reconstruction. \n\n\n### Plasmids \n  \nThe cDNAs encoding the, K6a , K6a , K6a , K6a  and K6a  mutant proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: N21S-forward: GGGGTTTCAGTGCCAgCTCAGCCAGGC, N21S-reverse: GCCTGGCTGAGcTGGCACTGAAACCCC, G97R-forward: GGCTTTGGTGGCGCCaGGAGTGGATTGG, G97R-reverse: CCAATCCACTCCtGGCGCCACCAAAGCC, S143N-forward: GTCAACCAGAaTCTCCTGACTCCCCTC, S143N-reverse: GAGGGGAGTCAGGAGAtTCTGGTTGAC, Y497C-forward: CCGTCTCCAGTGGCTgTGGCGGTGCCAG, Y497C-reverse: CTGGCACCGCCAcAGCCACTGGAGACGG, N171K-forward: GATCAAGACCCTCAAaAACAAGTTTGCC, N171K-reverse: GGCAAACTTGTTtTTGAGGGTCTTGATC (lower cases indicate the position of the mutations). The pBi4-GFP vector was used to simultaneously express the reporter protein EGFP with K6a , K6a , K6a , K6a , K6a , K6a , or K6a  under control of a unique tetracycline responsive element. \n\n\n### Cell culture and transfections \n  \nMurine Ameloblast-like cells (ALC) were kindly provided by Dr. Sugiyama [ ] and used to produce a tetracycline inducible ameloblast cell line. These cells were stably transfected with a prtTA2-M2/IRES-Neo plamid obtained after subcloning of the rtTA2-M2 cassette [ ] into the pCMV-IRES-Neo (Clontech). rtTA-M2 is a mutagenized form of rtTA that shows a lower basal activity and a higher sensitivity to doxycycline (Dox) than the original rtTA [ ]. The presence of the IRES cassette before the neomycin (Neo) resistance gene allowed coexpression of the rtTA-M2 transactivator and the Neo resistance gene, increasing the chance to select clones that express sufficient amounts of the transactivator in Neo-resistant cells. Clones were isolated and functionality of the tet system was screened by transient transfection with pTRE2-luc (expression of luciferase under the control of tetracycline responsive element). Cells were grown in the presence or absence of 2 ug/ml Dox and luciferase activity was estimated. One clone exhibiting a low basal activity of the transactivator in the absence of Dox and a strong induction in the presence of Dox (+Dox/-Dox ratio) was selected for subsequent experiments and named ALC-TetON. ALC-TetON cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1 ug/ml G418). For transfections, the cells were grown to at least 70% confluence. 2 million cells were used per transfection with either the pBi4-GFP/K6a , pBi4-GFP/K6a , pBi4-GFP/K6a , pBi4-GFP/K6a , pBi4-GFP/K6a , pBi4-GFP/K6a , or pBi4-GFP/K6a  plasmid and the pCMV-K16  plasmid (Amaxa Nucleofactor). \n\n\n### Immunocytochemistry \n  \nTransfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin and immediately induced with 2ug/ml doxycycline. Twenty-four hours after induction, cells were washed three times in 1X PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. A 5 min incubation in 0.2% Triton in 1X PBS was used to permeabilize the cells before blocking unspecific sites using 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were applied for 1 h. Primary antibody used: guinea-pig anti-K6 (Progen). Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were applied for 30 min. Secondary antibodies used: Alexa Fluor 555 anti-guinea pig IgG (Life Technologies). Nuclei were stained using DAPI and coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol (Calbiochem). Images were acquired using a LEICA Sp5 confocal microscope. \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5794186, "text_md5": "44459d5faa7080522d7b530ec2efa389", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 171], "journal": [172, 182], "publication_year": [184, 188], "title": [199, 300], "keywords": [314, 314], "abstract": [327, 3149], "body": [3158, 48244]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 29357356, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1007168", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794186", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5794186"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794186\">5794186</a>", "list_title": "PMC5794186  Genetic variants in pachyonychia congenita-associated keratins increase susceptibility to tooth decay"}

Elevated levels of circulating CRP are associated with response to infection, risk for a number of complex common diseases, and psychosocial stress. The objective of this study was to compare the contributions of genetic ancestry, socioenvironmental factors, and inflammation-related health conditions to ethnic differences in C-reactive protein levels. We used multivariable regression to compare CRP blood serum levels between Black and White ethnic groups from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) prospective cohort study. CRP serum levels are significantly associated with ethnicity in an age and sex adjusted model. Study participants who identify as Black have higher average CRP than those who identify as White, CRP increases with age, and females have higher average CRP than males. Ethnicity and sex show a significant interaction effect on CRP. Black females have higher average CRP levels than White females, whereas White males have higher average CRP than Black males. Significant associations between CRP, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry are almost completely attenuated in a fully adjusted model that includes socioenvironmental factors and inflammation-related health conditions. BMI, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation all have high relative effects on CRP. These results indicate that socioenvironmental factors contribute more to CRP ethnic differences than genetics. Differences in CRP are associated with ethnic disparities for a number of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, sarcoidosis, and lupus erythematosus. Our results indicate that ethnic differences in CRP are linked to both socioenvironmental factors and numerous ethnic health disparities. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nC-reactive protein (CRP) is synthesized by hepatocytes and secreted to the bloodstream in response to inflammation. CRP is employed as a serum biomarker for both acute and chronic inflammation, with important implications for immune response and overall health ( ;  ). Elevated levels of CRP have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of diabetes ( ), cardiovascular disease ( ), psychological stress ( ), and all-cause mortality ( ). \n\nCRP blood serum levels vary across ethnic groups ( ), with a number of studies showing that Black patients have higher average levels of circulating CRP than White patients ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Ethnic differences of this kind are likely to have multifactorial causes, including contributions from genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. Given the fact that ethnicity co-varies with all of these classes of risk factors, it is difficult to tease apart the genetic and socioenvironmental contributions to ethnic health disparities. This is further complicated by the fact that socially defined ethnicity is an imprecise proxy for genetic diversity. \n\nWe use genetic ancestry inference as a means to disambiguate genetic and socioenvironmental effects on ethnic health disparities. Genetic ancestry refers to patterns of genetic diversity that are linked to the geographical origins of human populations ( ). Individuals who share common ancestors have genetic similarities, and distinct ancestry groups show correlated allele frequency differences ( ;  ). Genetic ancestry can be defined objectively, using comparative genomic analysis, without relying on socially defined ethnic groups ( ). Patterns of genetic ancestry can be compared to self-identified ethnicity to understand the extent to which they overlap and how they may differ ( ;  ;  ). Modelling of health outcomes with genetic ancestry and socioenvironmental factors as independent (predictor) variables can be used to assess how each contribute to health disparities and how they may interact ( ;  ). \n\nThe objective of this study was to characterize the effects of genetic ancestry, socioenvironmental factors, and health conditions on ethnic disparities in CRP serum levels. Participants from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) prospective cohort study who self-identified as belonging to Black or White ethnic groups were characterized with respect to CRP levels, genome-wide genotypes, and a variety of socioenvironmental factors and health conditions that show prevalence disparities across groups. Multivariable regression and relative importance analysis were used in an effort to decompose genetic and socioenvironmental contributions to CRP ethnic disparities. Age and sex were considered as covariates in all models given their known associations with CRP serum levels. Given that genetic and socioenvironmental contributions to health outcomes can co-vary across ethnic groups, we hypothesized that the inclusion of socioenvironmental covariates could attenuate the association between ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and CRP levels. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study Cohort \n  \nStudy participants and data were taken from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB), a prospective cohort study on the effects of demography, environment, and genetics on health and disease ( ). The UKBB database contains phenotypic, clinical, and genetic information on more than 500,000 participants between the ages of 40 and 70, enrolled from 2006 to 2010. Ethics approval for the UKBB was obtained from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) for the United Kingdom, the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG) for England and Wales, and the Community Health Index Advisory Group (CHIAG) for Scotland . UKBB participants self-identified as belonging to a single ethnic group upon enrollment , and we included participants who identified as Black or White for this study. It should be noted that the UKBB ethnic group labels used here correspond directly to racial group labels from the United States. This study was conducted under the United Kingdom Biobank project #65206 to LMR and IKJ. \n\n\n### Participant Data \n  \nUKBB participants completed questionnaires, nurse-led interviews, and medical assessments upon enrollment and provided access to their electronic health records. We accessed participant information on age (Field 21003: Age when attended assessment center), BMI (Field 21001: Body mass index (BMI), ethnicity (Field 21000: Ethnic background), ICD-10 disease diagnosis codes (Fields 41270: Diagnoses\u2013ICD10), insomnia (Field 1200: Sleeplessness/insomnia), recruitment year (Field 53: Date of attending assessment centre), sex (Field 31: Sex), smoking status (Field 20116: Smoking status), and Townsend deprivation index (Field 189: Townsend deprivation index at recruitment) from the UKBB data portal. If multiple instances of participant data were available from a follow-up visit, only data collected during the initial assessment visit (2006\u20132010) were used for analysis. \n\nThe Townsend deprivation index is a widely used measure of socioeconomic deprivation known to be associated with poor health outcomes ( ). It combines four variables\u2013unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership, and household overcrowding\u2013to generate a numerical score ( ), which ranges from \u22126.26 to 11.0 in the UKBB study cohort. Negative values indicate less socioeconomic deprivation, and relative affluence, whereas higher scores indicate greater socioeconomic deprivation. \n\nUKBB participants provided whole blood samples for characterization of protein biomarkers and DNA as previously described ( ). C-reactive protein (CRP) blood serum levels were measured as mg/L units using the immuno-turbidimetric method with the Beckman Coulter AU5800 clinical chemistry analyzer . This procedure corresponds to the high-sensitivity (hs) CRP test. DNA was extracted from 850\u00a0\u03bcl buffy coat blood aliquots , and participant genome-wide genotypes were characterized using the UKBB Axiom Array or United Kingdom BiLEVE Array ( ). \n\n\n### Disease Case/Control Cohorts \n  \nDisease (or health condition) diagnoses for study participants were taken from UKBB ICD-10 diagnosis codes, which were then converted into disease-specific phenotype codes (phecodes) using the scheme developed by the PheWAS consortium ( ). Phecodes have been manually curated and validated by disease experts, and they are widely used for the analysis of electronic health record data ( ). The phecode scheme provides ICD-10 code inclusion and exclusion criteria for each individual disease in order to define disease-specific case/control cohorts that can be confidently compared. For example, when studying participants with type 2 diabetes, participants with type 1 diabetes are removed from the control cohort to avoid any overlapping genetic or environmental signals that might be common to both. This approach improves power for the detection of disease-specific association signals when modelling case/control status. Phecode case/control cohorts were curated for a total of 1,537 diseases or health-related conditions. \n\n\n### Genetic Ancestry Inference \n  \nUKBB participant genome-wide genotypes were merged and harmonized with whole genome sequence data from global reference populations characterized as part of the 1,000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) ( ;  ). Global reference populations were grouped into six regional ancestry groups based on their genetic and geographic affinity, including African (sub-Saharan) and European reference population groups ( ). \n\nUKBB, 1KGP, and HGDP genomic variant data were merged to include variants present in all three data sets. Minor allele frequency >1% and variant sample missingness <5% filters were used for merging, with variant strand flips and identifier inconsistencies corrected as needed. The merged genome variant data set was pruned for linkage disequilibrium using the program PLINK v2 ( ). \n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) of the harmonized UKBB, 1KGP, and HGDP genome variant dataset was performed using the FastPCA program implemented in PLINK v2 ( ). Data for the first ten PCs were used to infer UKBB participant genetic ancestry fractions for African, European, and other regional ancestry groups. Our PCA-based genetic ancestry inference approach compares PCA data from UKBB participants to PCA data from reference population individuals using non-negative least squares to assign genetic ancestry fractions for regional ancestry groups as previously described ( ;  ). Participants showing >5% non-African or non-European ancestry fractions were excluded from the study cohort. \n\n\n### Statistical Modeling \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical language v3.6.1 ( ). Forest plots were generated using the forestmodel R package ( ). Other plots were generated using the ggplot R package ( ). \n\nCRP blood serum levels are measured in mg/L units by the UKBB. Log transformed CRP blood serum levels were modeled as a continuous outcome using linear regression, and clinically elevated CRP (>3\u00a0mg/L) was modeled as a binary outcome using logistic regression using the \u201cglm\u201d function in R. Independent (predictor) variables for the base models included ethnicity, age, and sex. Ethnicity was modeled as a binary variable (Black or White), age was mean centered and modeled as a continuous variable, and sex was modeled as a binary variable (female or male). Independent (predictor) variables for the fully adjusted models included BMI, insomnia, major depressive disorder, PC1, and PC2, recruitment year, smoking status, and the Townsend deprivation index. BMI, PC1, and PC2, and the Townsend index were modeled as continuous variables, and insomnia and smoking status were modeled as categorical variables, and major depressive disorder was modeled as a binary variable. Relative importance analysis was used to assess the relative contributions of the different covariates in the fully adjusted model, while accounting for multicollinearity. The R package \u201crelaimpo\u201d was used for analysis. \n\nThe odds of prevalence of specific diseases or health conditions were modeled as the dependent (outcome) variable with multivariable logistic regression computed using the \u201cglm\u201d function in R. Independent (predictor) variables for disease models included ethnicity, mean centered age, sex, and log transformed CRP levels. \n\nModel specifications and detailed results for all statistical models are provided in the Supplementary Material. For each model, we provide the regression equation and model coefficients, along with effect size estimates, standard errors, z-values, and   p  -values for each model coefficient. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### C-Reactive Protein, Ethnicity, Age, and Sex \n  \nThe study cohort is made up of 433,298 United Kingdom Biobank participants who self-identify as Black (  n   = 6,456) or White (  n   = 426,842) ( ). Males make up 45.7% of the cohort compared to 54.3% females, and the mean age of cohort participants is 57. C-reactive protein (CRP) blood serum levels vary by ethnicity, age, and sex. Black participants show a mean CRP level of 2.75\u00a0mg/L, and White participants show mean CRP level of 2.59\u00a0mg/L (t = 2.72,   p   = 0.01;   and  ). 25% of Black participants have clinically elevated CRP compared to 22.6% of White participants ( ). Participant CRP levels increase with increasing age ( ), and females show higher mean CRP levels than males (t = 17.22,   p   < 2.2 \u00d7 10 ;  ). When CRP levels are modeled by ethnicity, age, and sex, Black ethnicity and age show significant positive associations with CRP, whereas male sex shows a significant negative association with CRP (ethnicity:   \u03b2   = 0.08,   p   = \u223c0, age:   \u03b2   = 0.02,   p   = \u223c0, sex:   \u03b2   = \u22120.06,   p   = \u223c0;   and  ). These results are robust to a sensitivity analysis conducted by removing individuals with high levels of CRP (\u226510\u00a0mg/L), indicative of acute infections ( ). Similarly, when clinically elevated CRP (>3\u00a0mg/L) is modeled as a binary outcome, Black ethnicity and age show significant positive associations, and male sex shows a significant negative association (ethnicity:   \u03b2   = 0.04,   p   = \u223c0, age:   \u03b2   = 0.003,   p   = \u223c0, sex:   \u03b2   = \u22120.04,   p   = \u223c0;  ). \n  \nCharacteristics of the United Kingdom Biobank participant cohort. \n    \nC-reactive protein (CRP), ethnicity, age, and sex.

Average CRP serum levels (\u00b195% CI) are shown for Black and White, female, and male participants. \n  \n\n### Ethnicity and Genetic Ancestry \n  \nBlack and White participants differ with respect to mean levels of African and European genetic ancestry ( ). Black participants show averages of 87.8% African ancestry and 11.7% European ancestry compared to averages of 99.8% European and 0.03% African ancestry for White participants (African ancestry: t = 671.91,   p   < 2.2 \u00d7 10 ; European ancestry: t = 672.38,   p   < 2.2 \u00d7 10 ). \n\nThe relationship between ethnicity and genetic diversity for Black and White participants can be visualized via principal components analysis of genome-wide genotype data ( ). Principal components one and two separate participants by ethnicity along a continuum of genetic diversity, whereas principal component two alone shows more within ethnic group differences among participants. Black participants show a range of admixture between African and European genetic ancestry fractions, whereas White participants show almost entirely European ancestry ( ). The probability of participant self-identification as Black or White shifts in the range of 23\u201344% African ancestry ( ). Participants are more likely to identify as Black, and less likely to identify as White, if they have \u226529% African ancestry. \n  \nEthnicity and genetic ancestry.

(B)   Participant ethnicity (left) compared to participant genetic ancestry fractions (right).   (C)   Probability of participant ethnic self-identity (  y  -axis) compared to African genetic ancestry (  x  -axis). Dots are color-coded by participant ethnicity and each dot shows the probability of self-identification as Black or White across one hundred bins of African ancestry. Black and White self-identification probability trend lines were fit using loess regression. \n  \n\n### Genetic and Socioenvironmental Effects on C-Reactive Protein Ethnic Disparities \n  \nMultivariable regression and relative importance analysis were used to model the effects of ethnicity, genetic ancestry, socioenvironmental factors, and health conditions that disproportionately affect different ethnic groups on CRP serum levels. Genetic ancestry was modeled using the first two principal components, which show the greatest separation between African and European ancestry components. Socioeconomic deprivation was modeled using the Townsend index, BMI, insomnia, and major depressive disorder (MDD) were included as disparate health conditions, and recruitment year and smoking were included as environmental exposures. The effect of recruitment year was considered to account for possible psychosocial stress associated with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. The effects of all covariates on CRP were considered separately using age and sex adjusted models and together with a fully adjusted model (  and  ). \n  \nC-reactive protein multivariable linear regression models. Covariates are shown along with the category labels for categorical variables. The effect of each covariate on CRP serum levels was considered separately with age and sex adjusted models and together in the fully adjusted model. Effect point estimates are shown for each covariate along with standard errors and   p  -values in parentheses. The relative importance rank of each covariate in the fully adjusted model is shown. \n  \nThe significant positive association between Black ethnicity and CRP levels is attenuated in the fully adjusted model, and ethnicity shows the lowest relative importance among the 11 covariates included in the model. The effects of genetic ancestry are similarly attenuated in the fully adjusted model and have the next lowest relative importance values (PC1 = 9, PC2 = 10). BMI has the highest relative effect on CRP in the fully adjusted model followed by age, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation measured by the Townsend index, and sex. Insomnia, recruitment year, and MDD all show significant but marginally important effects on CRP. Considered together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that ethnic differences in socioenvironmental exposures and health outcomes explain the association between ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and CRP levels. \n\n\n### C-Reactive Protein and Ethnic Health Disparities \n  \nThe relationship between CRP serum levels and ethnic health disparities was evaluated by independently modeling the effect of CRP and the effect of ethnicity on disease outcomes and comparing the results. There are 116 out of 1,537 diseases analyzed where both CRP and ethnicity showed significant associations with disease status, after correcting for multiple tests using the Bonferroni correction (  and  ). The effect size estimates for all diseases with significant CRP and ethnicity associations were evaluated to identify diseases where differences in CRP serum levels are implicated in ethnic health disparities ( ). The combined effects of CRP and ethnicity on disease outcomes were quantified by summing the ranks of the individual effect sizes. The top 20 diseases ordered via descending effect size rank sums are shown in  , and data for all diseases are shown in  . The top ranked diseases include examples of infectious disease (tuberculosis and HIV), metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia), circulatory system diseases (hypertensive chronic kidney disease, hypertensive heart disease, and essential hypertension), schizophrenia, genitourinary diseases (nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease), and dermatologic diseases (lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis). \n  \nC-reactive protein (CRP) and ethnic health disparities.

Our study of the UKBB found that CRP blood serum levels differ according to participant\u2019s self-identification as belonging to Black or White ethnic groups, and ethnicity in our cohort is highly correlated with genetic ancestry. Given these results, it could be naively expected that differences in genetic ancestry between the Black and White ethnic groups explain differences in CRP levels. However, comparisons between ethnic groups with distinct genetic ancestry profiles can be confounded by gene-environment correlations. Indeed, genetic ancestry, socioenvironmental factors, and health conditions can all co-vary among ethnic groups. We used multivariable regression and relative importance analysis in an effort to decompose the contributions of genetic ancestry, socioenvironmental factors, and health conditions to CRP ethnic disparities. \n\nWhen differences in socioenvironmental exposures and health outcomes are accounted for, the associations between ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and CRP levels are almost completely attenuated. These results indicate that the environment plays a more important role than genetics in shaping ethnic disparities in inflammation for this cohort. Possible socioenvironmental factors leading to higher levels of CRP observed for Black participants could include psychosocial stress linked to racial discrimination and poverty ( ;  ;  ;  ). The high relative effects of BMI and smoking on CRP suggests that aspects of diet and lifestyle associated with socioeconomic deprivation could also be linked to ethnic differences in inflammation ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAlthough we are making a semantic distinction between genetic effects, as measured by genetic ancestry, and the effects of socioenvironmental factors and health conditions, it should be noted that the socioenvironmental and health covariates modeled here are also likely be influenced by genetics. For example, BMI and smoking are both highly heritable traits. The effect of sex also likely includes a genetic component based on chromosomal differences between males and females. In other words, our approach to decomposing genetic and environmental contributions to health disparities is limited by the pervasive contributions of both genetics and the environment to human traits. \n\n\n### Interaction Between Ethnicity and Sex \n  \nUKBB participant CRP blood serum levels vary by ethnicity, age, and sex. Modeling CRP levels with all of these factors reveled a highly significant interaction effect between ethnicity and sex. Black females show higher CRP levels than White females, whereas Black males have lower CRP than White males. Thus, Black females are at the highest risk of chronic inflammation, suggesting the possibility of exposure to particularly high levels of stress for this group. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that Black women can experience worse health outcomes than Black men, White women, or White men owing to their relatively subordinate position in both ethnic and gender hierarchies ( ;  ). This perspective underscores the importance of an ethnic health disparities analysis framework that includes multiple, interacting demographic, genetic, and socioenvironmental factors ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Inflammation and Ethnic Health Disparities \n  \nWe related inflammation and ethnic health disparities by independently modeling the effect of CRP and ethnicity on disease status and then looking for diseases that showed significant associations with both factors. There were 109 out of 1,537 diseases that showed significant associations with both CRP and ethnicity, and we explored the diseases that showed the strongest effects for both. This approach uncovered a number of diseases linked to immune response and inflammation, including infectious diseases and complex, common diseases. This suggests the possibility that ethnic differences in inflammation, related to environmental exposures and psychosocial stress, could be broadly related to ethnic health disparities. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that our observational study design and statistical modelling do not allow for unambiguous causal inference regarding the relationship between CRP and disease ( ;  ). For infectious diseases, CRP levels are expected to be elevated after infection, which would entail a kind of reverse causality with respect to how our regression models are specified. For chronic diseases, systemic inflammation could precede disease or contribute to disease progression, but it could also reflect the presence of disease. Our models cannot distinguish between these possibilities, and it is not known whether participant CRP levels measured at recruitment precede or follow the diagnosis and course of disease. Thus, it is possible that the observed ethnic differences in CRP reflect a higher overall burden of disease for ethnic minorities in the UKBB, linked to higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation, rather than a causal risk factor for ethnic health disparities. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8558394, "text_md5": "c6be3cf79b0207d9f7acea0063f54c0a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 137], "journal": [138, 149], "publication_year": [151, 155], "title": [166, 264], "keywords": [278, 404], "abstract": [417, 2213], "body": [2222, 27603]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34733313, "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2021.738485", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8558394", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8558394"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8558394\">8558394</a>", "list_title": "PMC8558394  Comparing Genetic and Socioenvironmental Contributions to Ethnic Differences in C-Reactive Protein"}

Exposures consisted of publicly available genome\u2010wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from   MR Base   and   LD\u2010hub  . The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nHere, we have developed a public resource ( ) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low\u2010desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality. Ann Neurol 2019;85:470\u2013481 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; OMIM #105400) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease. Symptom onset of ALS peaks in the mid\u2010sixties, and most patients succumb to the disease within 2 to 5\u2009years of becoming symptomatic.  Prevalence of ALS is projected to nearly double by 2040, primarily attributed to aging of the global population. \n\nDespite considerable advances made in understanding the genetic architecture underlying ALS, ,   the contribution of lifestyle factors and of disease\u2010related conditions predisposing individuals to the disorder have been more difficult to elucidate. Epidemiological studies have attempted to identify risk factors and comorbidities associated with ALS, although the inability of such observational research to fully mitigate confounding effects or exclude reverse causality has made it challenging to find replicable causes of the disease. \n\nGenome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized human genetics and have led to the discovery of thousands of risk variants involved in disease etiology.  From the perspective of ALS research, summary statistics from hundreds of these studies have been published online in an effort to facilitate the application of current generation genomic techniques, such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression testing and Mendelian randomization. Both methodologies are powerful tools to assess causality and investigate the extent to which genetic etiologies are shared across different diseases. \n\nLD score regression and Mendelian randomization test distinct aspects of the genetic architecture underlying a disease. More specifically, LD score regression investigates whether polygenic risk contributing to a phenotype of interest might also contribute to the risk of ALS. This approach relies on the identification of shared genome\u2010wide heritability to pinpoint overlapping polygenic genetic variation between traits (pleiotropic relationship).  On the other hand, Mendelian randomization uses genetic data to assess whether an exposure exerts a causal effect on a particular outcome.  In contrast to LD score regression, Mendelian randomization usually focuses on genome\u2010wide significant single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the exposure of interest (causal relationship).  Because this analytical technique relies solely on genetic elements that remain constant over the life span of an individual, and that are randomized during gametogenesis, it effectively excludes reverse causality and reduces confounding to allow more reliable identification of a causal association between exposure and outcome. \n\nRecent ALS\u2010related Mendelian randomization studies have focused on a hypothesis driven by only a single trait. ,  ,   Here, we implemented LD score regression and Mendelian randomization in a large\u2010scale audit relevant to ALS. In brief, our goal was to survey curated libraries of GWAS results using LD score regression and Mendelian randomization. The former is more liberal in identifying shared variation that suggests a significant degree of shared genetic risk, whereas the latter is more conservative and attempts to pinpoint causal associations by established loci. We also created an online resource ( ) that can be used by the ALS community to inform pleiotropy or causality when undertaking observational studies or pursuing disease\u2010modifying interventions. \n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n###  Outcome Data  \n  \nSummary statistics from our recently published GWAS of ALS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls of European ancestry were used as the outcome for both LD score regression and Mendelian randomization analyses. This study included 10,031,630 genotyped and imputed variants. Sample recruitment and genotyping quality\u2010control procedures are described elsewhere. \n\n\n###  LD Score Regression  \n  \nLD patterns across the genome enable the calculation of genetic correlations between traits. This is because the observed association for an SNP is a product of both its own contribution toward a phenotype and the association of the SNPs that are in LD with it. SNPs in regions of high LD tag a greater proportion of the genome and will show stronger associations than SNPs in regions of low LD. Using the known LD structure of a reference SNP panel, the heritability of a single phenotype or the genetic correlation of two phenotypes can be computed using LD score regression. ,  \n\nTo study shared genetic risk by LD score regression, we used   LD Hub  , a centralized database of summary\u2010level GWAS results across multiple diseases/traits gathered from publicly available resources.  LD score regression was implemented by regression of the chi\u2010squared statistics for the genetic associations with the trait against the LD scores for genetic variants across the whole genome. Unlike Mendelian randomization, LD score regression does not assess casualty, but rather only assesses multidirectional correlations, and can distinguish between population stratification and polygenicity in GWAS studies. Default settings were used in our analyses. \n\n\n###  Mendelian Randomization  \n  \nMendelian randomization is a proxy\u2010based approach for exploring whether an exposure is causally associated with an outcome. This is done by: identifying the SNPs associated with a particular exposure (eg, SNPs identified in a GWAS as being associated with colon cancer); extracting data for those SNPs from the outcome (in this case, a large\u2010scale GWAS of ALS ); harmonizing the exposure and outcome summary data; and applying Mendelian randomization methods to test for a causal relationship between the exposure and the outcome rooted in genetic associations. \n\nSimilar to   LD\u2010Hub  , the   MR Base   database is a curated database containing summary results from 1,094 GWASes involving 889 traits.  These traits encompass a wide range of physiological characteristics and disease phenotypes. Each trait was tested separately as an exposure to determine if it alters risk of developing ALS. The analyses were performed using the R package   TwoSampleMR   (version 3.2.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The instrumental variables used for each exposure/phenotype consisted of the per\u2010allele log\u2010odds ratio (ie, beta estimate) and standard errors for all independent loci (ie, SNPs) reaching genome\u2010wide significance in the tested GWAS. Of the 1,094 GWASes with data available in   MR Base   (accessed August 15, 2018), 635 GWASes (consisting of 345 published GWASes and 290 unpublished GWASes performed on the UK Biobank;  ) were included in our analysis based on the following criteria: (1) GWAS with at least two associated SNPs with   p   values <5.0 \u00d7 10 , considering this   p   value to be the generally accepted genome\u2010wide significant threshold; (2) SNPs present in both the exposure and outcome (ALS) data sets or when not present their LD proxies (R  value >\u2009=\u20090.8); and (3) independent SNPs (R \u2009<0.001 with any other associated SNP within 10\u2009Mb), considered as the most stringent clumping threshold used when performing Mendelian randomization analyses. \n\nHarmonization was undertaken to rule out strand mismatches and ensure alignment of SNP effect sizes. Within each exposure GWAS, Wald ratios were calculated for each extracted SNP by dividing the per\u2010allele log\u2010odds ratio of that variant in the ALS data by the log\u2010odds ratio of the same variant in the exposure data. We then applied a two\u2010step approach designed to decrease the risk of false\u2010positive associations (see Fig   for the workflow). \n  \n Flow chart of analysis.   The ALS Research Resource is an interactive tool where the user can explore genetic correlations and causal associations across more than 700 traits. GWAS exposures used for LD score regressions are available in LD hub at  . GWAS exposures used for the Mendelian randomization analyses are available in MR Base at  . (A) The inclusion criteria used for LD score regression analyses comprise traits with heritability estimates within normal boundaries. (B) The inclusion criteria used for Mendelian randomization includes (1) GWAS with at least two associated SNPs with   p   values <5.0 \u00d7 10 ; (2) SNPs present in both the exposure and outcome (ALS) data sets or when not present their linkage\u2010disequilibrium (LD) proxies (R  value >\u2009=\u20090.8); and (3) independent SNPs (R \u2009<\u20090.001 with any other associated SNP within 10\u2009Mb), considered as the most stringent clumping threshold used when performing MR analyses. (C) LD score regression analyses included 751 publicly available GWASes considered as exposures of interest versus the most recent ALS GWAS as an outcome, and (D) MR analyses were performed considering two phases. Phase I includes 345 available GWASes in the public domain as exposures of interest while phase II includes unpublished UK Biobank GWAS data. (E) Significantly associated GWASes with ALS at inverse variance weighted (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). (F) Significantly associated GWASes with ALS at weighted median and MR Egger (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). (G) Causally linked GWASes with ALS after performing reverse causality, sensitivity, and directionality analyses. (H) Multivariate analyses used to explore how each related exposure of interest independently contributes to ALS. ALS\u2009=\u2009amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; GWAS\u2009=\u2009genome\u2010wide association study; kb\u2009=\u2009kilobases; R \u2009=\u2009clumping threshold; LDL\u2009=\u2009low\u2010density lipoprotein. \n  \nFirst, the inverse\u2010variance weighted method was implemented to examine the relationship between the exposure and ALS. In this method, the Wald ratio for each SNP is weighted according to the inverse variance, and a line, constrained to pass through the origin, is fitted to the data. The slope of the line represents the pooled\u2010effect estimate of the Wald ratios.  Traits were brought forward to the next stage of analysis only if the   p   value of the pooled\u2010effect estimate was \u22640.05. Next, two Mendelian randomization sensitivity tests (ie, MR Egger and weighted median) were applied to those traits/GWASes passing the first phase of analysis. These sensitivity analyses evaluated core assumptions of Mendelian randomization, and traits were considered to be consistent with a causal effect when   p   values were \u22640.05. Heterogeneity of effects were tested using the Cochran's Q test, quantified using the I  statistic, and displayed in forest plots. Steiger analyses were performed to verify that the proposed instruments were directly associated with the outcome  or effect estimate directionality. \n\nWe evaluated the possibility that the overall estimate was driven by a single SNP using leave\u2010one\u2010out analyses for each of the GWASes associated with ALS. We further explored the possibility of reverse causality by using SNPs tagging the five independent loci described in the ALS GWAS as exposure instrument variables and the identified GWASes as the outcome. Lasso\u2010based multivariate analysis was used to explore how each related exposure of interest (ie, low\u2010density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, self\u2010reported cholesterol, and coronary heart disease) independently contribute to ALS. \n\n\n###  Genetic Risk Score  \n  \nTo further test the relationship between LDL cholesterol and ALS, a cumulative genetic risk score for LDL cholesterol was calculated in a smaller subset of the samples for which individual genotype data were available, including 8,229 ALS cases and 36,329 controls.  Instrumental variables of interest were incorporated and weighted by beta values in the ALS GWAS. Next, a logistic regression was performed on this subset of cases and controls, regressing disease against quintile membership based on genetic risk score.  Odds ratios were reported comparing the lowest risk quintile (reference group) to the remaining quintiles. Genetic risk scores were also calculated for different subtypes of ALS patients (carriers of the pathogenic   C9orf72   repeat expansion, familial cases, sporadic cases, male cases, and female cases). Risk profiling was adjusted for sex, age, and 20 principal components to account for population stratification. \n\n\n###  Colocalization Analysis  \n  \nBayesian colocalization analysis was used as a statistical method to identify putative candidate genetic variants involved in LDL cholesterol blood levels that contribute most to the risk of developing ALS.  For these analyses, we considered the 78 SNPs that were significantly associated with increased LDL cholesterol and were used as relevant instrumental variables for Mendelian randomization analyses. We extracted summary statistics for those variants (as well as variants 1 megabase [Mb] upstream and downstream) from the LDL cholesterol GWAS and from the ALS GWAS. Bayesian colocalization was then run for each independent region as implemented in the R package coloc ( ). This analysis assessed the probability of each SNP being responsible for the change in ALS risk through variation in LDL cholesterol. We derived posterior probabilities (PPH ) for each region and considered PPH \u2009> 0.95 as strong evidence for colocalization under the assumption of a single causative variant per locus. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Large\u2010Scale LD Score Regression Analysis in ALS  \n  \nLD score regression was applied to examine the genetic correlation between our recently published GWAS meta\u2010analysis of ALS  and 736 phenotypes available in   LD\u2010hub  , a centralized database of GWAS results across multiple diseases and traits ( ; Fig  ). \n\n\n###  Traits Genetically Correlated to ALS by LD Score Regression  \n  \nOur analyses identified 18 traits that were genetically correlated to ALS after adjusting for multiple testing by false discovery rate (Table  ). Among these, nine traits were related to educational attainment and intelligence, indicating that higher levels of education were associated with a decreased risk of ALS (smallest adjusted   p   value\u2009=\u20091.78 \u00d7 10 ; regression coefficient\u2009=\u2009\u20130.338; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u2009\u20130.46, \u20130.20). \n  \nLinkage Disequilibrium Score Regression Results for Traits Genetically Correlated With ALS \n    \nTraits related to light physical activity, including walking for pleasure, walking as a mean of transport, and light DIY physical activities, were associated with decreased risk of developing ALS (smallest adjusted   p   value\u2009= 5.19 \u00d7 10 ; regression coefficient\u2009=\u2009\u20130.403; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u20130.35, \u20130.14), whereas heavier activity levels such as duration of moderate activity and performing a job that involves mainly walking or standing were positively associated to ALS (smallest adjusted   p   value\u2009= 3.09 \u00d7 10 ; regression coefficient = 0.28; 95% CI\u2009= \u20130.36, \u20130.09). \n\nSmoking behavior, including exposure to tobacco and being a light smoker, showed genetic correlation with ALS (smallest adjusted   p   value\u2009=\u20091.66 \u00d7 10 ; regression coefficient\u2009=\u20090.42; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.23, 0.62). Detailed results for the remaining 718 nonsignificant traits are shown in Table S1 and can be interactively searched at  . \n\n\n###  Large\u2010Scale Mendelian Randomization in ALS  \n  \nNext, we performed Mendelian randomization to further investigate causal links between multiple phenotypic traits (exposures) and ALS (outcome, Fig  ). The exposures of interest consisted of 345 GWASes involving a wide range of physiological characteristics and disease phenotypes for which data were available in   MR Base   ( ). The recently published GWAS of ALS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls was used as the outcome. \n\nThere are no previous reports in the literature where multiple phenotypes were tested using Mendelian randomization in an unbiased, hypothesis\u2010free manner. This raised concerns about false\u2010positive associations and multiple\u2010testing correction. To control for this and confirm the validity of our findings, we replicated in an independent collection of phenotypes (290 unpublished GWASes performed on the UK Biobank,  ). Here, we only report associations that were significant across both the published and unpublished sets of GWASes. Detailed results for the 635 GWAS under study are shown in Tables S2 to S4 and can be visually explored at  . \n\n\n###  Traits Causally Linked to ALS by Mendelian Randomization  \n  \nWe identified the phenotypic traits LDL cholesterol and coronary heart disease in the published GWASes, and self\u2010reported high cholesterol in the UK Biobank, as being causally linked to ALS risk (see Table   and Table S5 for SNPs used to construct the instruments of interest. Multivariate analysis showed that the signals arising from the coronary heart disease and self\u2010reported high cholesterol were driven by SNPs related to LDL cholesterol, revealing that both traits represent closely related phenotypes (Table  ). \n  \nMendelian Randomization Results for Exposures Causally Linked to ALS \n      \nMultivariable Analysis to Estimate the Simultaneous Effects of Two Exposures \n    \nLeave\u2010one\u2010out analysis indicated that no single SNP accounted for these associations in isolation (Table S6). Additional analyses examining directionality, pleiotropy, and reverse causality did not indicate any violation of core Mendelian randomization assumptions for these traits (Tables S7\u2013S8). We used genetic risk profiling to estimate the extent to which risk of developing ALS is attributable to LDL cholesterol. We found that individuals with the highest burden of genetic risk were 1.075 times more likely to develop ALS (95% CI, 1.001\u20131.150;   p   value\u2009= 0.003). The increase in ALS risk associated with LDL cholesterol levels was similar across different subtypes of ALS (  C9orf72   carriers, familial ALS, sporadic ALS, male, and female\u2010only cases; Table S9). \n\n\n###  Identification of Functional Causal Variants  \n  \nBayesian colocalization analysis was performed to putatively identify the functional candidate variants that may drive risk of developing ALS through shared pathway effects of LDL cholesterol levels. We focused our efforts on the 78 independent regions associated with LDL cholesterol in the exposure GWAS. This analysis identified two independent regions with >95% probability of containing a shared causal SNP (Table S10). Fine mapping of these regions identified two SNPs (rs182826525 within   COL4A3BP   and rs116226146 intergenic between   PPP1R2P3   and   TIMD4  ) as being causally linked to ALS through an increase of LDL cholesterol levels (Fig  ). \n  \n Bayesian colocalization plots.   A plot and B plot represent two independent LDL\u2010cholesterol\u2013associated regions with posterior probability greater than 95% of sharing a causal variant involved in ALS. Panels in column A show the region spanning chr5:73656720\u201075651786 where rs182826525 is likely the shared causal variant with a posterior probability of nearly 100%. Panels in column B show the region spanning chr5:155390511\u2010157388284 where rs116226146 is likely the shared causal variant with a posterior probability of 96%. The first row displays the   p   values from the LDL GWAS for each region. Color is coded by   p   values in the ALS GWAS. The second row displays the   p   values from the ALS GWAS for the same regions. Color is coded by   p   values in the LDL GWAS. The third row shows local gene positions (with strands denoted by \u00b1), as well as recombination rates measured in cM/Mb.  The bottom row shows the posterior probabilities of a shared causal variant between LDL cholesterol and ALS. ALS\u2009=\u2009amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; GWAS\u2009=\u2009genome\u2010wide association study; kb\u2009=\u2009kilobases; LDL\u2009=\u2009low\u2010density lipoprotein. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe applied cutting\u2010edge analytical techniques to genomic data across a wide range of phenotypic traits to identify factors associated with risk of developing ALS. This hypothesis\u2010free, data\u2010driven approach provided prima facie evidence supporting the existence of multiple such factors. Using genetic data to comprehensively map the risk factor landscape of ALS represents a novel approach in neurological disease. We used these results from nearly 25 million individuals (24,538,000 from published GWAS and \u223c337,159 from UKBB studies) to establish a public resource that can be accessed by other researchers to explore risk factors and shared disease mechanisms in ALS. \n\nLD score regression analyses found that common genetic variation associated with higher cognitive performance is negatively correlated to ALS. At a molecular level, these findings indicate that the genetic factors driving mental ability and ALS overlap to some extent. This may have been an expected outcome given the well\u2010known relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia, and our findings are consistent with previous epidemiological reports assessing the causal relationship between education and ALS.  Nevertheless, the large number of samples analyzed in our study and its grounding in genetics put this risk factor on a firmer footing within the ALS field. Similar education effects have been observed in Alzheimer's disease,  but understanding how education protects against neurodegeneration or which genetic variants are responsible for this shared risk will require additional study. One intriguing possibility is that the genetic variants responsible for ALS in middle age or in the elderly are also associated with decreased cognitive performance at a younger age. This is plausibly consistent with the observation that connectivity and gray matter volumes are altered in asymptomatic carriers of the   C9orf72   repeat expansion. ,  \n\nEpidemiological case\u2010control studies have extensively reported a relationship between exercise and risk of developing ALS, ,  ,   though there are conflicting results as to the level of physical activity required to increase risk.  Our genetic\u2010based data demonstrate that this neuromuscular interconnection may be more complex than previously appreciated: Light physical activity, including walking for pleasure or light DYI activities, was negatively associated with developing ALS, whereas more strenuous activity, such as duration of moderate activity, was paradoxically correlated with ALS. Extrapolating from these observations to neuromuscular physiology, relatively low levels of exercise may exert a neuroprotective effect by preventing muscle atrophy that, in turn, supports motor neuron integrity though the neuroadaptive generation of neurotrophic factors.  In contrast, excessive physical activity may be detrimental to motor neurons because of excessive free radical production and/or glutamate excitotoxicity that overwhelms neuroprotective mechanisms. ,   Regardless, our data do not provide any insight into the effect of exercise on survival once the patient has presented with symptoms. \n\nThere is compelling epidemiological evidence showing that cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for ALS.  Our LD data not only confirm that being a smoker is positively correlated to developing ALS, but also show that this effect is mediated, at least in part, through shared genetic mechanisms. This is an example of the ability of this type of genomic analysis to identify pleiotropic effects, which is where a defect in a single gene can give rise to multiple, apparently unrelated phenotypes. Here, we are extending the concept of pleiotropy beyond the single\u2010gene paradigm to encompass inherently complex traits driven by multiple genetic variants spread across the genome and that are typically outside of coding regions. LD score regression is not designed to identify the specific shared genetic variants responsible for both phenotypic traits, but instead focuses on establishing whether such pleiotropy exists between traits. \n\nUsing Mendelian randomization, we found strong evidence that an alteration of lipid metabolism is causally linked to ALS. We undertook sensitivity analyses to reduce the possibility of bias in our results and replicated our findings across three different exposure GWASes, including a large, independent cohort obtained from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increased risk of ALS attributed to coronary heart disease is driven by LDL cholesterol. Though hyperlipidemia only modestly increases the risk of ALS, this effect likely operates over the lifetime of the individual, and the cumulative effect on disease risk may be substantial. \n\nPrevious epidemiological studies have explored the role of blood lipids in the pathogenesis of ALS. These observational studies have yielded controversial results, with many reporting that hyperlipidemia increases disease risk and others suggesting the opposite. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   In addition to being underpowered, much of this previous research was based on blood\u2010lipid profiles obtained after diagnosis of ALS when ancillary factors may be influencing these levels. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \n\nThe singular advantage of Mendelian randomization is that it is agnostic to these confounders and can be considered nature's randomized controlled trial. Based on genetic data that remain constant between the presymptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease, it accurately pinpoints predisposing factors for the disease of interest. While the manuscript for this article was under review, a link between blood lipids and the risk of ALS has been recently reported in European and East Asian populations using polygenic risk scores and Mendelian randomization. ,   These studies were performed involving a smaller cohort of ALS cases and were based on the a priori hypothesis that blood lipids were involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. Our work extends these recent reports by definitely applying Mendelian randomization across a large number of phenotypic traits in an unbiased fashion, replicating our findings in an independent cohort (UK Biobank), and delineating the specific aspects of lipid metabolism relevant to the pathogenesis of ALS. \n\nCirculating blood cholesterol are multifunctional molecules, involved primarily in energy generation, as precursors or cofactors for signaling molecules, and in neuronal development and function.  Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain has been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Niemann\u2010Pick disease type C, and, most notably, Alzheimer's disease.  The generation and clearance of \u03b2\u2010amyloid protein is regulated by cholesterol, and drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis lower this protein within neurons,  as is the more recent finding that the two secretory forms (APP\u0251 and APP \u03b2) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) have opposing associations with \u03b2\u2010amyloid generation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and LDL receptor levels.  The identification of the cholesterol transport protein, apolipoprotein E, as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is also consistent with a role for cholesterol in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. ,   Despite this, the molecular mechanisms by which altered lipid metabolism leads to neuron degeneration are unclear. \n\nAn important question arising from our analysis centers on why LDL may causally affect ALS, while at the same time LDL levels are not genetically correlated with ALS under the LD Score regression model. This apparent divergence is because the variants linked to these two traits are not pleiotropic, and again highlights the fact that Mendelian randomization and LD regression analysis investigate different aspects of the genetic architecture underlying diseases. Mendelian randomization allows us to compare two groups of people that differ by the genetic variants of interest and therefore by any modifiable factor to which those genetic variants relate. In this case, genetic variants that are associated with LDL metabolism affect LDL levels, and a ratio measure is calculated to determine how much this estimated change in LDL level would predispose individuals to ALS. If substantial pleiotropy were present, we would find that the same genetic variants that affect LDL metabolism also increase the risk of ALS by themselves (ie, genetic correlation). Such pleiotropy was not observed in our data. Instead, we found that the only mechanism by which ALS risk could be increased is through an increase of LDL cholesterol levels (ie, linear association). \n\nOur data led us to propose that lowering blood\u2010cholesterol levels is a viable strategy for reducing risk associated with ALS. A similar approach may be effective in Alzheimer's disease where exposure to statins is associated with substantially reduced risk of dementia in observational studies. ,   Though the American Heart Association guidelines for treating blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk are widely implemented in the community, they primarily focus on patients aged >50\u2009years.  An alternative strategy may be to identify a younger subpopulation at increased risk of developing ALS and institute treatment with lipid\u2010lowering agents. This approach would initially focus on individuals with a family history of ALS or frontotemporal dementia, and on presymptomatic cases carrying the   C9orf72   repeat expansion; together, these subtypes account for nearly 1 in 5 cases of ALS.  Long\u2010term monitoring would be required to detect side effects from the medication and determine effect on age of disease onset. \n\nWe conclude by saying that the reported findings should be interpreted in the context of existing evidence from other research studies using different designs, and definite conclusions should not be elaborated uniquely based on Mendelian randomization results. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality. \n\n###  Limitations to This Study  \n  \nOur analyses were limited to only those GWAS studies present in two public databases, namely   LD\u2010hub   and   MR Base  . Furthermore, the available data are focused on European populations. We envisage that future studies may expand our findings by utilizing larger sample sizes, greater density across the genome, and importantly non\u2010European populations, highlighting the utility of an ALS resource that is constantly updated as new data become available. \n\nOne of the main caveats of working with summary level data (rather than individual\u2010level data) is that there is no possibility to filter and exclude sample overlap. For Mendelian randomization analyses, we cannot exclude the possibility that samples from the same individuals were used in both the GWASes that we identified as significant exposures and in the ALS GWAS that we used as the outcome measure. Such sample overlap may bias estimates in MR and increase type 1 error rates. We reviewed the origin of the European cohorts present in our ALS outcome and in the significantly associated exposures, and the results of this comparison are outlined in Table S11. Our data suggest that sample overlap had only a minimal effect on our results. We also performed sensitivity analyses by calculating the F\u2010statistic parameter as described elsewhere.  Our results showed that two of the three GWASes of interest for which the F\u2010statistic could be calculated were considered strong instruments and are unlikely to be susceptible to bias because of overlapping samples (F\u2010statistic for LDL cholesterol\u2009=\u200959.02; F\u2010statistic for coronary heart disease = 742.2). Furthermore, sample overlap alone cannot account for our findings, given that any sample overlap would be equally likely to occur across the diverse GWASes that we studied, and yet we consistently identified altered lipid metabolism as a risk factor for ALS across multiple GWAS studies and across multiple populations. There is no realistic scenario in which sample overlap could have been consistently confined to just GWASes involving lipid metabolism. However, given that Mendelian randomization effect estimates are often small, mandating additional follow\u2010up on connected pathways. \n\nA concern that might arise is to what extent hereditary cases of ALS carrying rare genetic variants might have influenced our analyses. One should expect that carrying large effect, rarer variants would not generally preclude the carrying of more common, small effect genetic risk factors which comprise the majority of GWAS results that were used for Mendelian randomization and LD Score regressions. \n\nFinally, we are aware that certain bias could exists because of undetectable issues in underlying GWAS results utilized in this survey, but the fact that we have replicated our results in independent GWASes alleviates this concern. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nS.B.C., A.J.N., M.A.N., and B.J.T. contributed to the conception and design of the study.

Whether this IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh population represents a unique Tfh subset with a distinct differentiation pathway is poorly understood. By using T-bet fate\u2013mapping mouse strains, we discovered that almost all the IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells have previously expressed T-bet and express high levels of NKG2D. DNase I hypersensitivity analysis indicated that the   Ifng   gene locus is partially accessible in this \u201cex\u2013T-bet\u201d population with a history of T-bet expression. Furthermore, multicolor tissue imaging revealed that the ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells found in germinal centers express IFN-\u03b3 in situ. Finally, we found that IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing Tfh cells are absent in T-bet\u2013deficient mice, but fully present in mice with T-bet deletion at late stages of T cell differentiation. Together, our findings demonstrate that transient expression of T-bet epigenetically imprints the   Ifng   locus for cytokine production in this Th1-like Tfh cell subset. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nT follicular helper (Tfh) cells are considered as a distinct subset of CD4 T helper (Th) cells, in parallel with classical type 1 Th (Th1), type 2 Th (Th2), and IL-17\u2013producing Th (Th17) cells ( ;  ;  ,  ). However, while Tfh cells mainly produce IL-21 as their signature cytokine, several studies have also shown that some Tfh cells are capable of expressing Th1- or Th2-signature cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4, both of which contribute to the regulation of different B cell Ig isotype switching ( ;  ;  ;  ). Overproduction of IFN-\u03b3 by Tfh cells also contributes to autoimmune disease lupus-associated pathology ( ). However, whether IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells represent a unique subset of Tfh cells or all the Tfh cells have the capacity to produce low amounts of IFN-\u03b3 is unknown. \n\nThe transcription factor BCL-6 is the master regulator for the differentiation and functions of Tfh cells ( ;  ;  ) and inhibits the expression of T-bet, a crucial transcription factor for differentiation of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Th1 cells ( ;  ;  ). Conversely, T-bet inhibits Tfh cell commitment by diverting BCL-6 from its target genes and/or by repressing BCL-6 expression ( ;  ,  ). Consistent with the idea of mutual repression between BCL-6 and T-bet, it has been shown that mature Tfh cells that express BCL-6 do not express T-bet ( ). However, a balance between BCL-6 and T-bet may also be achieved with their coexpression under certain circumstances, and thus, mature Tfh cells generated in vivo in response to bacterial or viral infections uniformly express low levels of T-bet ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, whether such low levels of T-bet expression are sufficient to induce IFN-\u03b3 production is not clear. It has been shown that although T-bet expression at low levels in a regulatory T (T reg) subset is sufficient to induce chemokine receptor CXCR3 expression, such low amounts of T-bet are not sufficient to induce IFN-\u03b3 production ( ). Therefore, how Tfh cells with low or no T-bet expression can produce IFN-\u03b3 is still not known. \n\nInterestingly, some studies have shown that BCL-6 and T-bet may be coexpressed at high levels by some CD4 T cells at early stage of infections ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It has been suggested that BCL-6/T-bet coexpressing early \u201cTh1\u201d cells may become mature Th1 cells by down-regulating BCL-6 during Th1 differentiation ( ). However, the relationship between these BCL-6/T-bet coexpressing cells and mature Tfh cells is not clear. It is possible that some CD4 T cells may initially express high levels of T-bet with or without BCL-6 expression and undergo chromatin remodeling at the   Ifng   locus, and during the process of these cells becoming BCL-6\u2013expressing Tfh cells and migrating to B cell follicle, T-bet expression would be extinguished by BCL-6. Nevertheless, in germinal centers (GCs), these mature Tfh cells that have previously expressed T-bet (referred to as ex\u2013T-bet cells hereafter) may epigenetically memorize their potential to produce IFN-\u03b3. \n\nHere we used a T-bet reporter and T-bet fate\u2013mapping mouse strain to test this intriguing hypothesis. We found that ex\u2013T-bet cells in the steady-state enriched for genes that are preferentially expressed by Tfh cells. Fully developed Tfh cells generated upon immunization in GC did not express T-bet; however, a substantial proportion of Tfh cells consisted of ex\u2013T-bet cells. Among the Tfh cells found in GC, the ex\u2013T-bet population represented the major IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing population in situ. Antigen-specific ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells had remodeled the   Ifng   locus and T-bet was essential for IFN-\u03b3 production by these Tfh cells. Finally, genome-wide analysis of Tfh cell subsets revealed that cell surface marker NKG2D was preferentially expressed by the ex\u2013T-bet Tfh subset. \n\n\n## Results and discussion \n  \n### Tfh signature genes are preferentially expressed by ex\u2013T-bet cells in steady-state \n  \nAlthough \u201cone transcription factor, one cell fate\u201d is a useful model to simply describe terminally differentiated CD4 T cells, accumulating evidence indicates that one \u201chomogenous\u201d cell type, particularly during their differentiation, may be quite heterogeneous based on dynamic coexpression of master transcription factors at the single-cell level ( ). We have previously reported that T-bet and GATA3 expression by T reg cells are dynamic, but transient expression of T-bet does not seem to be limited within the T reg population ( ). To track the fate of T-bet\u2013expressing effector CD4 T cells, we further studied the T-bet fate\u2013mapping mouse strain (Fig. S1 A), T-bet-ZsGreen-T2A-CreER -Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato (ZTCE-tdTomato), in which cells that have expressed T-bet during the period of tamoxifen (TMX) treatment are permanently marked by the expression of a fluorescent protein, tdTomato, even after they have turned off T-bet expression, which can be determined by the expression of another fluorescent protein, ZsGreen. \n\nNaive CD4 T cells from the ZTCE-tdTomato T-bet fate\u2013mapping mice were cultured under Th1 or Th17 conditions in vitro with or without 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment. Almost all the 4-OHT\u2013treated Th1 cells, but not Th17 cells, expressed both ZsGreen and tdTomato, indicating the faithfulness of this reporter system (Fig. S1 B). The effectiveness of T-bet fate\u2013mapping was also confirmed in vivo since most ZsGreen-expressing splenic CD4 T effector cells within the memory-like population (CD4 CD44 CD25 ) were also tdTomato-positive in the ZTCE-tdTomato mice injected with TMX, while the naive CD4 T cells (CD4 CD44 CD25 ) in the same animal did not express either ZsGreen or tdTomato ( ). We also observed that a substantial proportion of tdTomato-positive memory-like CD4 T cells did not express ZsGreen ( ); based on the properties of the reporter system, these are presumably cells that had transiently expressed T-bet during the period of exposure to TMX (ex\u2013T-bet cells). To verify the T-bet protein levels in T-bet\u2013expressing and ex\u2013T-bet cells, we sorted CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  and CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  cells as shown in   and then performed intracellular staining. Consistent with T-bet fate\u2013mapping system, T-bet protein was detected in all the purified CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  T-bet\u2013expressing cells; however, the vast majority of CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  cells did not express T-bet and thus were ex\u2013T-bet cells (  and Fig. S1 C). \n  \n Tfh cells in GCs do not express T-bet but some have a history of T-bet expression. (A)   ZTCE-tdTomato mice were treated (i.p.) with TMX on days 0, 2, and 5. After 10 d, the expression of ZsGreen and tdTomato by the splenic naive CD4 T cells (CD4 CD44 CD25 ) and memory-like CD4 T effector cells (CD4 CD44 CD25 ) cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The plot represents a typical profile from more than five experiments.   (B)   Splenic CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  (T G ) and CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  (T G ) cells sorted from TMX-treated naive ZTCE-tdTomato mice were used for RNA-Seq analysis. Samples are in biological duplicates.   (C)   Relative gene expression levels of Tfh-related genes in CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  (T G ) and CD4 CD44 CD25 tdTomato ZsGreen  (T G ) populations were measured by qRT-PCR (  n   = 4). Data are representative of three independent experiments.   (D)   Experimental procedure of immunizing ZTCE-tdTomato mice with AS15/CFA.   (E and F)   ZTCE-tdTomato mice were immunized with AS15/CFA for 16 d and treated with TMX as shown in D. dLN cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of ZsGreen  cells among the tdTomato  cells was calculated for the PD-1 CXCR5  non-Tfh and PD-1 CXCR5  Tfh populations (mean \u00b1 SD;   n   = 7; *, P < 0.0001). Data are representative of three independent experiments.   (G)   ZTCE-tdTomato mice were treated as in D. Different cell types in GC were analyzed by multicolor tissue imaging. GC (yellow, BCL-6); ex\u2013T-bet-Tfh cell (pink, CD4-blue and tdTomato-red); T-bet-ZsGreen-green. Arrows indicate ex\u2013T-bet-Tfh cells in GC. Data are representative of two independent experiments with two animals in each experiment. \n  \nWe then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to determine whether these ex\u2013T-bet cells have specific gene expression profiles. Comparing to the T-bet\u2013expressing (tdTomato ZsGreen , T G ) population, we identified 284 genes that were up-regulated and 319 genes that were down-regulated in the ex\u2013T-bet (tdTomato ZsGreen , T G ) population (  and Table S1). To determine what potential CD4 T subsets are within the ex\u2013T-bet population, we checked the 284 up-regulated genes for transcription factors and cytokines that are important for different CD4 T subsets and found that transcription factors   Bcl6  ,   Rorc  , and   Foxp3  , and cytokines   Il21   and   Tgfb3   were enriched in the ex\u2013T-bet population (Fig. S1, D and E). GO cellular component analysis showed that cell surface molecules   Cxcr5   and   Pdcd1   were highly expressed in the ex\u2013T-bet population (Fig. S1 F).   Cxcr5  ,   Pdcd1  ,   Bcl6  , and   Il21   mRNA levels were also confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR;  ). Collectively, these data indicate that T-bet may be dynamically expressed by several subsets of splenic CD4 T cells, including a T reg subset as we reported previously ( ), and that the ex\u2013T-bet cell population also contains Tfh-like cells since the expression of Tfh signature genes including   Cxcr5  ,   Pdcd1  ,   Bcl6  , and   Il21   was enriched in this population. \n\n\n### A subset of Tfh cells induced by immunization has a history of T-bet expression \n  \nSince an ex\u2013T-bet population within splenocytes from naive mice displays a Tfh-like phenotype, we wondered whether T-bet is transiently expressed during Tfh cell differentiation in vivo  .   Some reports using infection models have shown that T-bet is expressed by all the Tfh cells, but at low levels ( ;  ;  ); this is probably due to a strong Th1 response in these models. \n\nTo investigate the heterogeneity of Tfh cells in vivo, we adopted an immunization protocol known to generate a robust antigen-specific Tfh cell response without biasing toward a Th1 response ( ;  ). ZTCE-tdTomato mice were immunized with the 15-mer peptide, AS15, whose sequence is derived from a protein of   Toxoplasma gondii  , as an antigen emulsified in CFA. To make sure that TMX was delivered to cells when animals were immunized, we pretreated mice with TMX 1 d before immunization ( ). Since Tfh-like cells were found in naive mice, we used tetramer staining to track newly differentiated antigen-specific Tfh cells in our study (Fig. S2 A). After 16 d of immunization, the vast majority of the antigen-specific CXCR5 PD-1  Tfh cells in the draining lymph node (dLN) did not express the T-bet-ZsGreen reporter ( ), which is consistent with an antagonistic relationship between transcription factor T-bet and BCL-6. However, a substantial proportion of these Tfh cells (\u223c20%) displayed an ex\u2013T-bet cell phenotype (tdTomato ZsGreen ). In contrast, even though ex\u2013T-bet cells were also found in the CXCR5 PD-1  non-Tfh cell population, about half of these tdTomato  cells also expressed high levels of ZsGreen ( ). Interestingly, on day 6 after immunization, a substantial proportion (\u223c10\u201315%) of CXCR5 PD-1  cell population expressed T-bet-ZsGreen, but the frequency of T-bet-ZsGreen\u2013expressing cells, as well as mean fluorescence intensity of T-bet-ZsGreen within the CXCR5 PD-1  Tfh cell population, dramatically reduced on day 16 (Fig. S2 B). These results indicate that T-bet is transiently expressed during the differentiation of a Tfh subset. \n\nAlthough CXCR5 is wildly used to identify Tfh cells, the function of mature Tfh cells depends on their location ( ;  ), and they reside in B cell follicle with some within GC. BCL-6 is highly expressed by GC B cells and Tfh cells and widely used to identify GC. We used multiplex immunofluorescence confocal imaging of the dLN to localize the ex\u2013T-bet CD4 T cells. Consistent with the flow cytometry data, a substantial fraction of CD4 T cells found in GC were ex\u2013T-bet (CD4 tdTomato , shown as pink in the image), but not T-bet\u2013expressing (CD4 ZsGreen ), cells ( ). Thus, using T-bet fate\u2013mapping mice, we found T-bet is transiently expressed during differentiation of a Tfh cell subset, and ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells can be found within GC in vivo after immunization. \n\n\n### The ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells in GCs are potent IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells \n  \nTo test whether the AS15-specific Tfh cells can express IFN-\u03b3, and if so, to understand the relationship between IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells and ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells, we purified and studied the CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells from the AS15/CFA-immunized ZTCE-tdTomato mice. Strikingly, among the Tfh compartment, only the ex\u2013T-bet (tdTomato ) population represented potent IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells ( ). By using another T-bet fate\u2013mapping mouse strain, T-bet-Cre-tdTomato (Fig. S2, C and D), in which all cells that are currently expressing or have previously expressed T-bet are labeled by tdTomato expression in the absence of TMX, we confirmed that all the cells capable of IFN-\u03b3 production were within the population that had expressed T-bet (  and Fig. S2 E). To further confirm IFN-\u03b3 production without in vitro restimulation and to visualize IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells in situ, we made an IFN-\u03b3-eYFP-T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mouse strain. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all eYFP  IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells were within the tdTomato  population (  and Fig. S2 F). Imaging of the draining lymph node of the immunized mice also showed that almost all the IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells (eYFP CD4 ) in the GC were tdTomato  ( ). Collectively, our data indicate that, although Tfh cells do not express T-bet in GC, the IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing Tfh cells in GC represent a subset of Tfh cells that have a history of T-bet expression. \n  \n Ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells display a partial accessibility at the   Ifng   locus and have the capability to express IFN-\u03b3. (A\u2013C)   Sorted CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells from the immunized TMX-treated ZTCE-tdTomato mice (A and B) or TMX-untreated T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice (C) were cultured in IL-2\u2013supplemented media overnight. Cells were then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. Cytokine production was assessed by intracellular staining. Percentages of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells were calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; in B: **, P < 0.005,   n   = 6; in C: *, P < 0.05,   n   = 3). Data are representative of two independent experiments (A\u2013C).   (D)   Cells from dLN of immunized IFN-\u03b3-eYFP-T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice were stained with cell surface markers. Percentage of eYFP  cells among the CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  tdTomato  or tdTomato  Tfh (CXCR5 PD-1 ) population was calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; *, P < 0.05,   n   = 4). Data are representative of three independent experiments.   (E)   IFN-\u03b3-eYFP-T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice were immunized with AS15/CFA. dLN was harvest for imaging analysis. GC (yellow, BCL-6); IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing ex\u2013T-bet-Tfh cell (shown in white; CD4 shown in blue; tdTomato shown in red; and IFN-\u03b3-eYFP shown in green). Arrows indicate IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing ex\u2013T-bet-Tfh cells. Data are representative of two independent experiments with two animals in each experiment.   (F)   CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer -CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , and CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato  cells were sorted from AS15/CFA-immunized T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice. DHS analysis was performed through scDNase-Seq, and the   Ifng   gene locus was viewed by the Washington University genome browser. Peaks at the CNS-34, CNS-6 and CNS+29 sites that displayed differential accessibility among the samples are highlighted in red. Cell samples are in biological duplicates. \n  \n\n### The   Ifng   locus is accessible in ex\u2013T-bet Tfh but not in other Tfh cells \n  \nEpigenetic information often predicts a development fate and \u201cmemorializes\u201d the prior effect of a transcription factor during cell differentiation ( ), which can be reflected by \u201copen chromatin regions\u201d identified through detection of DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs;  ;  ). It has been reported that T-bet is involved in chromatin remodeling at the   Ifng   locus during Th1 cell differentiation ( ;  ). However, it is not known whether transient expression of T-bet is sufficient to remodel the   Ifng   locus. To evaluate the accessibility of   Ifng   locus in the antigen-specific ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells, we applied a sensitive DHS assay (scDNase-Seq;  ) with tdTomato  and tdTomato  Tfh (CXCR5 PD-1 ) as well as tdTomato  and tdTomato  non-Tfh (CXCR5 PD-1 ) populations within the CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells from the AS15/CFA-immunized T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice. Interestingly, the   Ifng   locus was accessible at the CNS-6 and CNS+29 regions in both ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells (CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato ) and CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato  population that presumably contains conventional Th1 cells, whereas these regions were inaccessible or much less accessible in the tdTomato  Tfh and non-Tfh cells ( ). In contrast, the CNS-34 site was primarily accessible in CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato  population. Thus, the   Ifng   locus is partially accessible in ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells compared with the conventional Th1 cells and these results suggest that at early stage of Tfh cell differentiation, transient expression of T-bet may epigenetically imprint the   Ifng   locus for its later expression in a subset of Tfh cells. \n\n\n### Transient T-bet expression is required for IFN-\u03b3 production by Tfh cells \n  \nThe above results showed that ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells had the capability to express IFN-\u03b3. However, whether transient T-bet expression during development is necessary for Tfh cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 is unknown. We first immunized   Tbx21  -CD4-Cre and wild-type control mice. The percentage, as well as the total cell numbers, of antigen-specific CXCR5 PD-1  Tfh cells were higher in T-bet\u2013deficient mice than in wild-type control mice ( ). This is consistent with the function of T-bet in inhibiting BCL-6 activity as previously reported ( ). Nevertheless, IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tfh cells was abolished in the absence of T-bet ( ). To test whether T-bet is required at late stages of T cell differentiation, we treated ZTCE-tdTomato and ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21   mice with TMX after 7 d of immunization (  and Fig. S1 A). Interestingly, the Tfh cells from the ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21   mice (T-bet late\u2013knock-out mice) could still express normal levels of IFN-\u03b3 ( ). However, the percentage of antigen-specific CXCR5 PD-1  Tfh cells were higher in ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21   mice treated with TMX ( ). Thus, transient but not continuous T-bet expression is essential for Tfh cells to acquire and maintain their ability to produce IFN-\u03b3. \n  \n Early but not late expression of T-bet is necessary for IFN-\u03b3 production in Tfh cells. (A and B)   CD4-Cre-  Tbx21   and wild-type (WT) control mice were immunized with AS15/CFA for 16 d. The total cell number (A) and percentage (B) of CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer CXCR5 PD-1  population was calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; *, P < 0.05,   n   = 5). Data are representative of three independent experiments.   (C)   CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells from immunized CD4-Cre-  Tbx21   and wild-type control mice were sorted and cultured in IL-2 supplemented media overnight. Cytokine production was assessed by intracellular staining 4 h after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Percentages of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells were calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; **, P < 0.0005;   n   \u2265 5). Data are representative of two independent experiments.   (D)   Experimental procedure of immunizing the ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21   mice with AS15/CFA while inducing late T-bet deletion.   (E)   ZTCE-tdTomato and ZTCE-tdTomato  -Tbx21   mice were immunized with AS15/CFA for 16 d and treated with TMX on days 7, 9, and 12 as shown in D. CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells were sorted and cultured in IL-2\u2013supplemented media overnight. Cells were then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. Cytokine production was assessed by intracellular staining. Percentages of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells were calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; n.s.; not statistically significant,   n   = 6). Data are representative of two independent experiments.   (F)   Mice were treated as in D. The percentage of CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer CXCR5 PD-1  population was calculated (mean \u00b1 SD; *, P < 0.05;   n   \u2265 4). Data are representative of two independent experiments. \n  \n\n### NKG2D is preferentially expressed by ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells \n  \nGiven that transient T-bet expression is essential for Tfh cells to acquire their ability to produce IFN-\u03b3, finding specific surface protein(s) to distinguish ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells from other Tfh cells will be helpful to track IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells without using the T-bet fate\u2013mapping tools. We thus performed RNA-Seq analysis on the same cell subsets that were used for scDNaseI-Seq analysis. Clustering of all differentially expressed genes among these four groups (  and Table S2) revealed T-bet fate\u2013mapping\u2013associated gene clusters (Clusters 1, 2, and 3) and Tfh cell-specific gene clusters (Clusters 4 and 5). Within the Cluster 2, a subset of genes, including   Ifng  , was expressed at higher levels in tdTomato  Tfh cells than in tdTomato  Tfh cells as expected. Interestingly, genes in Cluster 3, such as   Klrk1  , were highly expressed in both Tfh and non-Tfh cells that were tdTomato . There was a substantial overlap between the 67 genes that were higher in tdTomato  Tfh cells than in their tdTomato  counterparts, and the 113 genes that were higher in tdTomato  non-Tfh cells than in their tdTomato  counterparts ( ). Although   Ifng   expression was increased in both tdTomato  Tfh and non-Tfh population, higher levels of   Ifng   transcripts were detected in tdTomato  non-Tfh cells compared with tdTomato  Tfh cells (Table S2), which is consistent with the DHS results shown in  . Within the 67 genes, there were 9 differentially expressed genes that encode proteins located at plasma membrane ( ). Indeed, high protein expression levels of NKG2D (encoded by   Klrk1  ) and NKG2A/B (encoded by   Klrc1  ) were found in tdTomato , but not tdTomato  antigen-specific Tfh cells ( ). On the other hand, a well-known Th1-specific protein CXCR3, which is also a T-bet target gene, was expressed only by a fraction of tdTomato  Tfh cells ( ). Furthermore, by using eYFP-IFN-\u03b3 reporter mice, we found that all the antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells were NKG2D positive ( ). Thus, NKG2D serves as a useful cell surface marker to identify the IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh subset. \n  \n Unique gene expression profile of the ex\u2013T-bet Tfh cells reveals cell surface markers for identifying this population. (A)   RNA-Seq analysis was performed using CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer -CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , and CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato  antigen-specific cell populations from dLN of AS15/CFA-immunized T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice. Differentially expressed genes were clustered. Cell samples are in biological duplicates.   (B)   Overlapping of the 67 and 113 genes that were expressed at higher levels in tdTomato  cells compared with tdTomato  counterparts in Tfh and non-Tfh compartment, respectively.   (C)   tdTomato  Tfh cell\u2013specific genes (compared with the tdTomato  Tfh cells) that encode cell surface molecules.   (D)   Antigen-specific Tfh cells from the AS15/CFA-immunized T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice were stained with anti-NKG2D, anti-NKG2A/B, or anti-CXCR3. Data are representative of three independent experiments.   (E)   NKG2D and IFN-\u03b3-eYFP expression in antigen-specific Tfh cells from immunized IFN-\u03b3-eYFP mice were measured. Data are representative of two independent experiments with five animals in each experiment. \n  \nIn conclusion, we have identified a subset of Tfh cells with a history of T-bet expression and epigenetic imprints on the   Ifng   locus; these cells express NKG2D and have the capability to express IFN-\u03b3 in GC. Early but not late T-bet expression is required for the development of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells. In fact, T-bet expression at late stages of T cell differentiation is inhibitory for the generation of this subset. Thus, manipulating the duration of T-bet expression in vivo may regulate the balance between IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Th1 cells and IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing Tfh cells. \n\nTfh cells and T reg cells have been regarded as parallel CD4 T cell subsets to conventional Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells ( ). However, it has been recently shown that the master regulators for conventional effector T helper cells, T-bet (for Th1), GATA3 (for Th2), and ROR\u03b3t (for Th17) can be expressed by different subsets of T reg cells ( ;  ;  ). For Tfh cells, our finding that a subset of Tfh cells have a history of T-bet expression may have a broader implication since some Tfh cells are capable of expressing the Th2 signature cytokine IL-4, and some Tfh cells that induce antigen-specific IgA responses in the gut are derived from IL-17\u2013producing, presumably ROR\u03b3t-expressing, cells ( ;  ;  ;  ). It has been reported that while GATA3 is critical for the acquisition of IL-4\u2013producing capacity, it is no longer essential for IL-4 production after cell fate commitment ( ). It has also been previously shown that during an in vivo response to LCMV infection, BCL-6\u2013expressing Tfh cells 5 d after infection express high levels of T-bet; however, the mature Tfh cells 15 d after infection express very low levels of T-bet ( ). It is likely that high levels of T-bet expression during early Tfh cell differentiation determine the capacity of these pre-Tfh cells to produce IFN-\u03b3, whereas low levels of T-bet expression in mature Tfh cells may not be functionally relevant. \n\nBased on our current study and these previous reports discussed above, we propose that transient induction of a particular effector master regulator, including T-bet, GATA3 and ROR\u03b3t may be a common feature for the development of distinct IFN-\u03b3\u2013, IL-4\u2013, or IL-17\u2013producing Tfh subsets in GCs. Thus, dynamic coexpression of multiple antagonizing transcription factors could be a plausible mechanism that results in heterogeneity and plasticity of CD4 T helper cells. In a striking parallel with T reg cells, Tfh cells should also be considered to exist in distinct differentiated states similar to conventional effector T helper cells. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Mice \n  \nT-bet-  Z  sGreen-  T  2A-  C  re  E  R  (ZTCE)-Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-  tdTomato   (ZTCE-tdTomato) mice on C57BL/6 background was previously described ( ), and ZTCE-tdTomato mice were bred to   Tbx21   mice to generate ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21  . T-bet-Cre mice ( ) (JAX 024507) were bred onto Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato ( ) (JAX 7914) for six generations to generate T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mouse strain. T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice were further crossed with IFN-\u03b3-eYFP ( ; JAX 017580) mice to generate IFN-\u03b3-eYFP-T-bet-Cre-tdTomato. T-bet-ZsGreen mice were previously generated ( ) and maintained at the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\u2013Taconic repository (Line 8419).   Tbx21   ( ) were bred to CD4-Cre mice ( ) to generate CD4-Cre-  Tbx21   mice. All mice were 8\u201312 wk of age when they were used under a protocol approved by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were bred and/or maintained in the NIAID specific pathogen-free animal facilities. \n\n\n### Mouse manipulation \n  \nNaive ZTCE-tdTomato mice were administrated with 3 mg TMX (T5648; Sigma) in corn oil (C8267; Sigma) through i.p. injection on days 0, 2, and 5. 10 d after TMX injection, splenic cells were harvested for sorting and followed by RNA-Seq analysis. In all immunization assays, mice were immunized with 20-\u00b5g peptide AS15 (AVEIHRPVPGTAPPS; synthesized by Peptide Synthesis and Analysis Unit, Research Technologies Branch, NIAID) emulsified in the oil and CFA (F5506, Sigma) by subcutaneous s.c. injection at two sites along the back (50 \u00b5l/site). After 16 d, inguinal draining lymph nodes (dLN) were harvested to make single-cell suspension for staining or fixed for imaging. ZTCE-tdTomato mice were treated with TMX on days \u22121, 2, 7, and 12 and immunized with AS15/CFA on day 0. Cells were stained at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with Tetramer I-A -AVEIHRPVPGTAPPS-APC or -BV421 provided by the National Institutes of Health Tetramer Core Facility. To delete T-bet at a late stage, ZTCE-tdTomato-  Tbx21   mice were injected with TMX on days 7, 9, and 12 after they were immunized with AS15/CFA. \n\n\n### Cell culture and purification \n  \nNaive CD4 T cells (CD4 CD44 CD62L CD25 ) were sorted from peripheral lymph nodes by using FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were mixed with T cell\u2013depleted splenocytes (used as antigen-presenting cells) and cultured under Th1 conditions (anti-CD3, 1 \u00b5g/ml; anti-CD28, 3 \u00b5g/ml; anti\u2013IL-4, 10 \u00b5g/ml; IL-12, 10 ng/ml; and IL-2, 100 U/ml) or Th17 conditions (anti-CD3, 1 \u00b5g/ml; anti-CD28, 3 \u00b5g/ml; anti\u2013IL-4, 10 \u00b5g/ml; anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3, 10 \u00b5g/ml; anti\u2013IL-12, 10 \u00b5g/ml; TGF\u03b21, 1 ng/ml; IL-6, 10 ng/ml; and IL-1\u03b2, 10 ng/ml) for 4 d. 4-OHT was added at the beginning of the culture. FACS-sorted CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer  cells from dLN were cultured in resting condition (IL-2, 50 U/ml) overnight before restimulation. The basic culturing media is the RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 200 mM glutamine, 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 50 \u00b5M \u200b\u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. \n\n\n### Immunofluorescent staining \n  \nMice were immunized with AS15/CFA, and dLNs were harvested after 16 d. Samples were treated with the fixation and permeabilization solution (554722; BD Bioscience) for 12 h. Samples were then dehydrated in 30% sucrose and embedded in optimal cutting temperature freezing media (Sakura Finetek). CM3050S cryostat (Leica) and Superfrost Plus slides (VWR) were used to make sections, which were further permeabilized and blocked in PBS (0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal mouse serum) and then stained with antibodies in PBS (0.01% Triton X-100 and 5% normal mouse serum). Fluormount G (Southern Biotech) and Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope were used to collect signaling from slides. Data were analyzed by Imaris software (Bitplane). Antibodies against CD4 (RM4-5), BCL-6 (K112-91), and B220 (RA3-6B2) were purchased from BD Bioscience; antibody against GFP/YFP (A-21311) was purchased from Thermo Fisher. \n\n\n### Flow cytometry analysis and reagents \n  \nUnless otherwise stated, cell staining was performed at 4\u00b0C. Single-cell suspensions were first incubated with anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2) for 15 min to block antibody Fc receptors. To detect intracellular cytokine production in vitro, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 500 nM ionomycin for 4 h in the presence of monensin (00-4505-41; eBioscience). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. For transcription factors staining, the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (00-5523-00; eBioscience) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Flow cytometry data were collected from the LSR II or FORTESSA (BD Biosciences), and the results were analyzed with the FlowJo 10 software (Tree Star). Antibodies were purchased from several commercial sources indicated below. Antibodies against CD4 (RM4-5), CD25 (PC61.5), CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14), and PD-1 (J43) were from eBioscience; anti-CXCR5 (2G8), IFN-\u03b3 (XMG1.2), T-bet (O4-46), CD138 (281\u20132), CD19 (1D3), B220 (RA3-6B2), NKG2D (9C11G4), and NKG2A/C/E (20d5) from BD Bioscience; anti-IL-4 (11B11) was from BioLegend; 2.4G2 (PUR001) was from Harlan; and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 was from eBioscience. \n\n\n### qRT\u2013PCR \n  \nRNeasy Mini kit (74104; Qiagen) was used to harvest total RNAs from sorted cell samples. The diluted RNAs were reverse transcribed with PrimeScript RT Master Mix (RR036A; TaKaRa) and analyzed with 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox; 04913850001; Roche). Expression of specific gene transcripts was measured by using the following primer pairs:   Il21  , 5\u2032-GGACCCTTGTCTGTCTGGTAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGTGGAGCTGATAGAAGTTCAGG-3\u2032;   Cxcr5  , 5\u2032-ATGAACTACCCACTAACCCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TGTAGGGGAATCTCCGTGCT-3\u2032;   Bcl6  , 5\u2032- CCGGCACGCTAGTGATGTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGTCTTATGGGCTCTAAACTGCT-3\u2032;   Pdcd1  , 5\u2032-ACCCTGGTCATTCACTTGGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CATTTGCTCCCTCTGACACTG-3\u2032;   Tbx21  , 5\u2032-AGCAAGGACGGCGAATGTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGTGGACATATAAGCGGTTC-3\u2032.   Hprt   was used for normalization purposes. \n\n\n### RNA-Seq and scDNase-Seq analysis \n  \nCD4 CD44 CD25  tdTomato ZsGreen  and CD4 CD44 CD25  tdTomato ZsGreen  cells from naive mice after TMX treatment were used for RNA-Seq experiment. CD4 CD44 CD25 Tetramer -CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato , and CXCR5 PD-1 tdTomato  cells from AS15/CFA-immunized T-bet-Cre-tdTomato mice were used for RNA-Seq and scDNase-Seq analysis. The total RNAs were harvested and purified by using Qiagen\u2019s miRNeasy micro kit (217084; Qiagen). Qiagen\u2019s DNase set (79254; Qiagen) was used for on-column DNase digestion. PolyA-tailed RNAs were purified from total RNA by using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (61012; Ambion Life Technologies). scDNase-Seq was performed according to a protocol described previously ( ). The RNA-Seq and scDNase-Seq libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq system, and 50 bp reads were generated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute DNA Sequencing and Computational Biology Core. Sequence reads were mapped to mouse genome (mm9) by using bowtie 2 with default settings ( ), and reads mapped to multiple positions (MAPQ < 10) were discarded. In the DHS analysis, only one read for genomic site with multiple alignment hits were retained. Gene expression levels were measured by RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million reads;  ). Differentially expressed genes were identified by edgeR 3 ( ) with the following criteria: FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.01, FC (fold change) log  \u2265 1, and RPKM \u2265 3. Differently expressed genes were clustered by using software MeV. SICER ( ) was used to call peaks (window size is 200 bp, gap size is 400 bp, and others by defaults). The location of protein is analyzed by PANTHER Overrepresentation Test\u2013GO cellular component complete. \n\n\n### Statistics \n  \nDifferences between groups were determined by two-tailed unpaired or paired Student\u2019s   t   test with Prism 7 software (GraphPad).

Existing techniques for profiling epigenetic marks in single cells often require the use and optimization of time-intensive procedures such as drop fluidics, chromatin fragmentation, and end repair. Here we describe ACT-seq, a streamlined method for mapping genome-wide distributions of histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins in a small number of or single cells. ACT-seq utilizes a fusion of Tn5 transposase to Protein A that is targeted to chromatin by a specific antibody, allowing chromatin fragmentation and sequence tag insertion specifically at genomic sites presenting the relevant antigen. The Tn5 transposase enables the use of an index multiplexing strategy (iACT-seq), which enables construction of thousands of single-cell libraries in one day by a single researcher without the need for drop-based fluidics or visual sorting. We conclude that ACT-seq present an attractive alternative to existing techniques for mapping epigenetic marks in single cells. \n  \nThe authors introduce ACT-seq: a Tn5-based method for rapidly profiling epigenetic marks in bulk-cell and single-cell samples. ACT-seq avoids many laborious or time-consuming steps required for similar techniques including chromatin fragmentation and end repair. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTechniques for mapping epigenetic states in individual cells have enhanced our understanding of differentiation and cell-to-cell variation. Multiple single-cell approaches have been developed to map transcriptomes and chromatin organization, and these methods are proving invaluable in fields such as cancer research . Comparatively few methods exist for single-cell profiling of histone tail modifications , which play important roles in epigenetic control of gene expression and development . Here we describe antibody-guided chromatin tagmentation sequencing (ACT-seq), a technique to assay distributions of epigenetic marks in a small number of cells or thousands of single cells simultaneously. \n\nACT-seq utilizes Tn5 transposase, which is commonly used to map chromatin accessibility and structure . We fused the N terminus of Tn5 transposase to Protein A (PA) to form a fusion protein hereafter referred to as PA-Tnp (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The PA domain of the fusion protein is first bound to an antibody that is selected to target an epigenetic mark or chromatin-bound protein of interest. The complex is then incubated with permeabilized cells and is guided to chromatin by the associated antibody. After washing away unbound complex, the transposition reaction is initiated by addition of an MgCl -containing buffer, which results in insertion of sequence tags at sites of bound PA-Tnp. The reaction is terminated by incubation with EDTA and proteinase. The labeled fragments are directly amplified using PCR and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ACT-seq robustly maps epigenetic marks in bulk-cell samples \n  \nTo evaluate the efficiency of ACT-seq, we mapped the distributions of a variety of epigenetic features in HEK293T cells: the histone tail modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H2K27ac; the histone variant H2A.Z; and the chromatin-binding protein Brd4. Visual inspection using a genome browser revealed highly similar distributions of enrichment in the bulk-cell ACT-seq data relative to published ChIP-seq data sets (Fig.\u00a0 ) . By comparison, little to no specific enrichment was apparent in the ACT-seq mock IgG sample, indicating that the observed signals were antibody-specific. Analysis of statistically significant peaks of enrichment also revealed strong correlations between the data sets obtained using ACT-seq and ChIP-seq (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Further, we detected strong average enrichment of H3K27ac, H2A.Z, and Brd4 at transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancer regions in our ACT-seq data (Fig.\u00a0 ) in agreement with published studies on these factors . To determine whether the ACT-seq signal was distinguishable from nonspecific Tn5 activity at regions of open chromatin, we statistically compared the H3K4me3 ACT-seq peaks with a published ATAC-seq data set that was generated using the same cell type . We found that over 11,000 ACT-seq peaks remained after filtering using a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05, indicating that ACT-seq peaks predominantly arise from antibody binding as opposed to nonspecific Tn5 activity (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Taken together, these analyses confirm that ACT-seq and ChIP-seq provide comparable information on enrichment of epigenetic marks in bulk-cell samples.   \nACT-seq robustly maps epigenetic marks in bulk-cell samples.   a   Genome browser image depicting enrichment of the indicated epigenetic factors in HEK293T cells at a representative genomic region. Data were obtained using ACT-seq (blue, green) or ChIP-seq (red). The ChIP-seq samples were obtained from published ENCODE data sets. A mock IgG sample (aggregated from all ACT-seq IgG replicates) is included as a comparative control for enrichment.   b   Metagene profile of average H3K27ac, H2A.Z, and Brd4 enrichment at the transcription start site (TSS) region of annotated genes from the hg19 genome.   c   Metagene profile of average H3K27ac, H2A.Z, and Brd4 enrichment at enhancer (Enh) regions. Enhancers were identified as regions enriched for H3K27ac that did not overlap with an annotated TSS.   d   Genome browser image depicting enrichment of H3K4me3 in HEK293T samples of the indicated cell number at a representative genomic region. A published ChIP-seq sample from ENCODE is provided for comparison.   e   Metagene profile of average H3K4me3 enrichment at the TSS region of annotated genes from the hg19 genome. Samples were obtained using the indicated number of cells. A published ChIP-seq sample from ENCODE is provided for comparison \n  \n\nTo evaluate the sensitivity of ACT-seq, we replicated the H3K4me3 data set using samples comprising varying cell numbers. Visual inspection of these data sets revealed that peaks were reliably detected using as few as 1000 cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). This also held true for the pattern of average H3K4me3 enrichment at the TSS of genes (Fig.\u00a0 ). Consistent with these results, we observed strong correlation between statistically significant regions of enrichment in the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data set and in each of the ACT-seq data sets obtained using different numbers of cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These results support the reproducibility of ACT-seq data obtained from bulk samples of as few as 1000 cells. \n\n\n### iACT-seq robustly maps epigenetic marks in single cells \n  \nTo map epigenetic marks in single cells, we adapted the ACT-seq method described in the section above using a barcode multiplexing strategy similar to previously published approaches . Permeabilized cells were divided volumetrically into 96 wells at a density of 5000 cells per well. Each well was treated with a separate PA-Tnp complex carrying a unique combination of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequence barcodes. After washing away any unbound complex, the cells were pooled and distributed into a second 96-well plate at a density of 18 cells per well using FACS sorting. The transposition reaction was initiated by addition of MgCl  and terminated by addition of EDTA and proteinase. Library construction and amplification were performed separately in each well using a second set of distinct index barcodes that were unique to each well. The samples were then pooled, purified, and sequenced. \n\nUsing this indexing ACT-seq (iACT-seq) strategy, we mapped H3K4me3 enrichment in 1246 individual cells (Fig.\u00a0 ) and obtained about 2500 unique reads per cell. Visual inspection of the mapped single-cell reads revealed that the read density predominantly clustered in the peaks of enrichment present in the bulk-cell ACT-seq and ChIP-seq data sets (Fig.\u00a0 ). Further, the pattern of average enrichment at the TSS regions of annotated genes was highly reproducible among the individual cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). Calculations of the precision and sensitivity metrics (Fig.\u00a0 ) for iACT-seq compare favorably to existing techniques. For example, our analysis found that iACT-seq yielded an average sensitivity of 0.05 and a precision of 0.6, whereas Drop-ChIP  yielded values of 0.07 and 0.53, respectively. Visual inspection revealed that the precision of iACT-seq also compared favorably to ChIL-seq  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We next examined whether the distribution of H3K4me3 enrichment was similar between iACT-seq and ChIP-seq. We found that peaks of statistically significant H3K4me3 enrichment were highly correlated between the iACT-seq data and the ENCODE ChIP-seq data set (Fig.\u00a0 ), in a similar manner to our analysis of the bulk-cell ACT-seq results (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Based on our analyses, we conclude that iACT-seq is capable of efficiently mapping epigenetic marks in thousands of individual cells simultaneously, which takes 1 day of bench work.   \nACT-seq reproducibly maps epigenetic marks in single cells.   a   Genome browser image of H3K4me3 peaks from bulk-cell ChIP-seq (blue) and pooled iACT-seq (red).

First, it eliminates procedures that often require laborious optimization or time-consuming incubations such as chromatin fragmentation using sonication or enzymatic digestion, immunoprecipitation, end repair, and adapter ligation. Further, split-pool barcoding can be used in parallel with this method to efficiently profile epigenetic marks in thousands of single cells simultaneously. \n\nBased on our analyses, we found that ACT-seq was capable of robustly mapping epigenomic features in bulk-cell samples including histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins. The iACT-seq method for profiling single cells efficiently reproduced the patterns of enrichment observed in the bulk-cell samples. A simulation was used to calculate the theoretical number of cell doublets (two cells mistakenly identified as a single cell) remaining in the iACT-seq data after filtering ( ). Based on this simulation, we estimated that 54 cell doublets remained out of 1246 cells (4.3%). This small number of potential doublets is unlikely to perturb biological interpretation of the data. However, the possibility of a small number of residual cell doublets should be considered by investigators if their samples are extremely heterogenous or if the expected number of cells to be sequenced is very small. The total time required for an ACT-seq experiment is 5\u20136\u2009h, which is sufficient to generate libraries for a dozen epigenetic features. This duration is much shorter compared to other commonly used methods for mapping histone modifications. Similarly, an iACT-seq experiment requires only one day of bench work to construct libraries for thousands of single cells. Based on these attributes and its ease of use, we conclude that ACT-seq presents an attractive alternative to existing techniques for profiling epigenetic marks in bulk and single-cell samples. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Detailed protocols \n  \nThe ACT-seq and iACT-seq methods, including variants using formaldehyde crosslinking, are available in bullet-point format at The Protocol Exchange website [ ]. \n\n\n### Preparation of the PA-Tnp transposon complex for bulk cells \n  \nThe expression vector containing the PA-Tnp fusion construct is available from Addgene under accession number 121137 [ ]. Recombinant PA-Tnp protein was expressed in BL21-Gold(DE3) competent cells (Agilent cat # 230132) and purified using nickel beads. Quality and purity of the isolated protein was assayed using SDS-PAGE. In all, 10\u2009\u03bcM of recombinant PA-Tnp protein was incubated for 10\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C in complex formation buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 12.5% glycerol) containing 50\u2009\u03bcM of 5\u2032 complex barcode and 50\u2009\u03bcM of 3\u2032 complex barcode. 1\u2009\u03bcL of the appropriate antibody (at the stock concentration provided by the manufacturers) was added to 12\u2009\u03bcL of prepared complex and incubated at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. The antibodies used in this study, listed with the manufacturer\u2019s provided concentration information, were: anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore cat # 17-614, indicated 3\u2009\u03bcL for one ChIP sample), anti-H3K4me2 (Abcam cat # ab32356, 0.1\u20130.5\u2009mg/mL), anti-H3K4me1 (Abcam ab8895, <1\u2009mg/mL), anti-H3K27ac (Abcam ab4729, <1\u2009mg/mL), anti-H2A.Z (Abcam ab4174, 0.8 to 1\u2009mg/mL), anti-BRD4 (Bethyl cat # A301-985A100, 1\u2009mg/mL), and normal IgGs (Millipore cat # cs200581, 1\u2009mg/mL). \n\n\n### Bulk-cell chromatin binding and tagmentation \n  \nHEK293T cells were permeabilized using a 10-min incubation on ice in 500\u2009\u03bcL of complex formation buffer per ~1 million cells. After permeabilization, all subsequent centrifugations of cells were performed using the following procedure: 1\u2009min spin at 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009  g  , rotate tubes 180\u00b0, repeat spin, leave ~10\u2009\u03bcL of solution in the tube when removing buffer. Pelleted cells were washed once with 500\u2009\u03bcL of complex buffer and suspended in another 500\u2009\u03bcL of buffer. Aliquots of 1000 cell equivalents were transferred volumetrically to clean microcentrifuge tubes and adjusted to 50\u2009\u03bcL total volume using complex buffer. In total, 5\u2009\u03bcL of antibody-bound PA-Tnp complex was added to each 50\u2009\u03bcL cell aliquot and incubated at room temperature for 60\u2009min to allow chromatin binding. Unbound complex was removed using three washes performed as follows: pellet and suspend cells in 500\u2009\u03bcL of wash buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), rotate tube for 5\u2009min at room temperature, repeat. Pelleted cells were rinsed with 500\u2009\u03bcL of rinse buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The rinse buffer was removed and 90\u2009\u03bcL of reaction buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10\u2009mM MgCl , 0.1% Triton X-100) was added to the pelleted cells for a total volume of ~100\u2009\u03bcL. The tubes were incubated for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C to allow transposition to occur. The reaction was terminated by addition of 4\u2009\u03bcL of 0.5\u2009M EDTA, 2\u2009\u03bcL of 10% SDS, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of 20\u2009mg/mL Proteinase K followed by a 60\u2009min incubation at 55\u2009\u00b0C. \n\nDNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was suspended in 10\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0. PCR reactions for library preparation were performed by adding the following to the 10\u2009\u03bcL DNA sample: 25\u2009\u03bcL of Phusion High-fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB catalog # M0531S), 1\u2009\u03bcL of 5\u2032 library index barcode, 1\u2009\u03bcL of 3\u2032 library index barcode, and 13\u2009\u03bcL of nuclease-free water. Amplification was performed using an initial step of 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min followed by 15 cycles of: 98\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 65\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, and a final extension step of 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments of the desired size were excised and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen cat # 28506). \n\n\n### Preparation of PA-Tnp for single cells \n  \nPreparation of the PA-Tnp complex was performed in PCR tube strips totaling 96 wells, with each well receiving a unique combination of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 complex barcodes. The following were mixed in each well: 1\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL recombinant PA-Tnp protein, 0.75\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM 5\u2032 complex barcode, 0.75\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM 3\u2032 complex barcode, and 2.5\u2009\u03bcL of 2X complex buffer. Tube strips were incubated at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to allow complex formation. In all, 1\u2009\u03bcL of each of the 96 prepared PA-Tnp complexes were transferred to 96 fresh PCR tubes, carefully mixed with 0.8\u2009\u03bcL of the desired antibody, and incubated at room temperature for 60\u2009min. \n\n\n### Single-cell chromatin binding and tagmentation \n  \nOne million HEK293T cells (ATCC accession number CRL-3216) were washed and permeabilized as described above. Aliquots of 10,000 permeabilized cells were volumetrically dispensed into the wells. The samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 60\u2009min to allow chromatin binding. Unbound complex was removed by centrifuging the PCR tube strips for 3\u2009min at 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009  g   and carefully discarding all but ~10\u2009\u03bcL of the solutions. In total, 50\u2009\u03bcL of complex buffer was added to each well, and the centrifugation and volume removal steps were repeated. The cell solutions were suspended and pooled together in a single microcentrifuge tube for a total of ~1\u2009mL of combined volume. The tube containing the pooled cells was centrifuged for 1\u2009min at 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009  g  , rotated 180\u00b0, centrifuged again, and all but ~20\u2009\u03bcL of solution was carefully removed. The cells were suspended in 200\u2009\u03bcL of complex buffer and filtered using a cell strainer test tube (Corning cat # 352235). A FACS instrument was used to distribute the (un-stained) cells into 96 clean wells containing 18 cells each. The transposition reaction was initiated by adding 10\u2009mM MgCl  to each well in 10\u2009\u03bcL final volume followed by a 37-\u00b0C incubation for 60\u2009min. The reactions were terminated by addition of 12\u2009mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009AU/mL protease (Qiagen cat # 19157) to each well followed by a 60-min incubation at 55\u2009\u00b0C. Each sample was transferred to a separate microcentrifuge tube and subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation to purify the DNA. The samples were suspended in 10\u2009\u03bcL each of 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0 and transferred back to PCR tube strips. \n\nFor library preparation, 0.5\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM 3\u2032 library index barcode was added to each of the 96 wells, with each well receiving a 3\u2032 barcode with a unique sequence. Each well then received 10\u2009\u03bcL of Phusion High-fidelity PCR Master Mix and 0.5\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM universal 5\u2032 library index barcode. Eighteen cycles of PCR amplification were performed using the program described above. In total, 10\u2009\u03bcL of each PCR product were pooled and purified using three columns of a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen cat # 28004) for a total elution volume of 30\u2009\u03bcL. Fragments of the desired size were gel-purified as described above. \n\n\n### Sequencing and data analysis \n  \nPaired-end sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The resulting reads were mapped to the hg18 reference genome using Bowtie2 . Data analysis and visualization was performed using custom R and Matlab scripts. \n\nThe TSS density profiles were computed using HOMER . H3K4me3 peaks were identified using SICER  with following parameters: gap size\u2009=\u2009200\u2009bp and window size\u2009=\u2009200\u2009bp. The function \u201cfindOverlaps\u201d from the R package GenomicRanges  was used to compute the overlap between two sets of peaks. Spearman correlation was used to compare the read density between libraries. The ENCODE ChIP-seq data sets used for comparison were downloaded from GEO under accession numbers GSM2711409 (H3K27ac), GSM2711410 (H3K4me1), GSM2711411 (H3K4me2), and GSM945288 (H3K4me3)). \n\nTo filter out potential doublets from our iACT-seq sample population, we first calculated the collision rate (the predicted percentage of cell barcodes that corresponded to doublets) as described previously . Chen et al.  determined that doublets contain a higher read density than single cells. Using their approach, we filtered out the top ~8% of cells from each well based on our calculated collision rate. We also removed low-quality libraries with fewer than 500 reads. After trimming, 1246 single-cell libraries remained. To estimate the number of doublets remaining after filtering, we performed a simulation as described in Supplementary File\u00a0 . Based on this simulation, we estimated that 54 doublets remained in the cell population. Mapping statistics are included in Supplementary Data\u00a0  and summarized in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Oligonucleotide sequences \n  \nThe names and sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are available in Excel format in Supplementary Data\u00a0 .

We demonstrate that the transgenes are expressed ubiquitously and are stable over two generations of breeding. We further demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing can be used to mark endogenous proteins with FLAG or StrepII-FLAG affinity tags to enable in vivo and ex vivo protein studies. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis is the first account of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockins in   Hydractinia   and the first example of the germline transmission of a CRISPR/Cas9 inserted transgene in a cnidarian  .\u00a0  The ability to precisely insert exogenous DNA into the   Hydractinia   genome will enable sophisticated genetic studies and further development of functional genomics tools in this understudied cnidarian model. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5032-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nCnidarians are a phylum of morphologically simple, primarily marine invertebrates. They have long served as experimental models in the fields of developmental biology, symbiosis, and self/non-self recognition (reviewed in [ \u2013 ]). More recently, cnidarians have generated interest as models for regenerative and stem cell biology [ \u2013 ], neurobiology [ ,  ], biophysics [ ,  ] and aging [ ,  ]. As the closest outgroup to bilaterians [ ,  ], cnidarians also provide context for our understanding of how fundamental biological processes have evolved in other animals, including humans. Indeed, cnidarian genomes are remarkably similar to the human genome in terms of gene content and structure [ ,  ]. Cnidarian genomes also possess many human disease genes not found in other animal models [ ]. For these reasons, there is an increasing demand for tools allowing direct tests of gene function in cnidarian species. \n\n Hydractinia   is a genus of colonial marine hydroids and a rapidly maturing model system for cnidarian genetics and functional genomics. Like the two most commonly used cnidarian models,   Hydra   and   Nematostella  ,   Hydractinia   has played a key role in our understanding of the molecular basis of development and tissue regeneration [ \u2013 ]. Because   Hydractinia   diverged from   Hydra   306\u2013428 million years ago and   Nematostella   570\u2013635 million years ago [ \u2013 ] (divergence times roughly equivalent to the human/frog and human/hagfish splits, respectively [ ]), genetic studies that include these three taxa increase the phylogenetic resolution with which we can understand the evolution of gene function. In addition,   Hydractinia   exhibits traits that are difficult or impossible to study at the molecular level in other cnidarians, including a pluripotent stem cell lineage called interstitial cells (i-cells) [ ], coloniality [ ], morphological polymorphism [ ,  ], and allorecognition [ ]. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint,   Hydractinia   offers several advantages. It is small in size and inexpensive to culture. Robust laboratory strains for one   Hydractinia   species (  H. symbiolongicarpus  ) are available (Nicotra ML, personal communication), and a project to sequence its genome is underway [ ]. It is transparent, facilitating in vivo microscopic observations throughout the animal at all developmental stages. It is also simple to breed because it spawns daily in response to a light cue, generates embryos that are easy to manipulate, grows into adults that are sessile and dioecious, and has a three-month generation time (comparable to mice and zebrafish). In addition, colonies can be clonally replicated and do not appear to age in the lab, allowing researchers to work with the same animal for years. These features are one reason that   H. symbiolongicarpus   is the only cnidarian in which a forward genetic approach has been used to identify the genetic basis of a phenotype [ ,  ]. Reverse genetic techniques are also possible in   Hydractinia  , including RNA interference (RNAi) [ ,  ,  ], morpholinos [ ], and the creation of transgenics via the random integration of exogenous DNA into the genome [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nOne bottleneck in performing functional genomics in   Hydractinia   and other cnidarians has been the inability to create heritable genetic modifications leading to true gene knockouts or knockins. With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, this goal is now within reach. To date, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to disrupt genes in several cnidarians, including   Nematostella   [ \u2013 ],   Clytia   [ ],   Acropora   [ ], and   Hydractinia   [ ]  .   These studies have each employed embryonic injection of one or more guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to disrupt a gene of interest and then evaluated phenotypes during the development of these injected embryos or the adult animals derived from injected embryos. In addition, there has been one study in which a fluorescent reporter was knocked into a gene in   Nematostella   [ ]. Germline transmission of a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome edit has yet to be achieved in any cnidarian. \n\nHere, we report the first use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate knockins in   H. symbiolongicarpus  . Specifically, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock fluorescent reporters and small affinity tags into the endogenous   Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha   (  Eef1a  ) locus. The transgenes were successfully transmitted through the germline to create fully transgenic animals and were stable over two generations of breeding. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of tagging the endogenous protein with two different affinity tags to perform in vivo and ex vivo protein studies. The ability to generate targeted gene knockins greatly increases the feasibility of studying the functions of cnidarian genes in their endogenous genomic environment, which can include complex   cis   and   trans   regulatory elements. It will also enable researchers to more efficiently create knockouts with fluorescent gene traps, to test hypotheses of protein function through targeted point mutations, and to engineer conditional transgenics that will allow gene expression to be controlled in site-, cell-, and/or time-specific ways. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identification of   Hydractinia Eef1a   and parental genotyping \n  \nPublished and unpublished work from our laboratories has shown it is possible to create point mutations, small indels, and large deletions in the   Hydractinia   genome by injecting Cas9:sgRNA protein:RNA complexes into zygotes [ ,  ]. In the present study, we sought to test whether we could use CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homologous recombination to introduce exogenous DNA encoding fluorescent proteins into the   Hydractinia   genome. To test this, we focused on editing the   Eef1a   locus because it is a highly expressed housekeeping gene and would enhance our chances of visualizing the insertions. \n\nTo identify the   Hydractinia Eef1a   locus, we used previously published   H. symbiolongicarpus   RNA-Seq data [ ] in conjunction with a draft genome assembly for a male colony, 291\u201310 [ ]. Because   Hydractinia   are diploid and 291\u201310 was bred from two animals from\u00a0an outcrossing population, we expected it to carry two distinct   Eef1a   alleles, which we searched for and found in the mRNA and genome sequences. Each allele encodes the same 465 amino acid peptide, spans ~\u20092.5\u00a0kb of genomic sequence, and is comprised of four exons (Fig.\u00a0 ) (GenBank accession numbers MH513671 and MH513672). The top hits resulting from BLASTP searches of these Eef1a peptides against the NCBI refseq_protein database were to Eef1a proteins from   Trichoplax adhaerens   (87% identity),   Branchiostoma floridae   (85% identity), and   Crassostrea virginica   (84% identity).   \n Hydractinia Eef1a   gene structure and strategy for mutagenesis by homology directed repair.   a   Genomic organization of   Hydractinia Eef1a  .

The single letter codes for the amino acid translation of the coding sequence are\u00a0shown above the double-stranded DNA sequence. Bracketed text indicates the FLAG-P2A-eGFP cassette. Base pairs shown in italics were inserted to maintain the full Eef1a peptide \n  \n\nOur microinjection experiments would ultimately require embryos, which we planned to generate by crossing 291\u201310 to a female colony, 295\u20138, which is a half-sibling of 291\u201310 (Additional file  : Figure S1). Because this female was likely to be heterozygous at   Eef1a  , we also genotyped it at the targeted region of   Eef1a  . We PCR-amplified the genomic region encoding exons 3\u20134 of   Eef1a  , which yielded a 2.0\u00a0kb and a 2.4\u00a0kb amplicon. Each amplicon was cloned and sequenced, revealing a ~\u2009400\u00a0bp indel downstream of the   Eef1a   3\u2019UTR (Additional file  ). We concluded these sequences represented the two maternal   Eef1a   alleles. Aligning the four   Eef1a   alleles (two alleles from each parent of the planned cross) revealed several sequence variants but, as expected for a highly conserved housekeeping gene, identical coding sequences (Additional file  ). \n\n\n### CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination at the   Eef1a   locus \n  \nOur first goal was to test whether we could insert a transgene encoding an affinity tag and fluorescent reporter into the 3\u2032 end of   Eef1a   via Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (Fig.  ). To do this, we identified a NGG PAM site 14\u00a0bp upstream of the stop codon and used it to design a 20\u00a0bp sgRNA (sgRNA_847, Fig.  ) that was conserved across the four   Eef1a   alleles (Additional file  ). Local BLASTs of this sgRNA_847 sequence against the draft genome revealed no obvious off-target matches outside of   Eef1a   in the genome. We then created a plasmid to act as the repair template for homology-directed repair. This plasmid, pUP613 (Additional file  ), consisted of two 1000\u00a0bp homology arms matching the sequences immediately before and after the predicted Cas9 cut site of one   Eef1a   allele from colony 291\u201310. Between these arms, we inserted 8\u00a0bp to complete the   Ef1a   coding sequence (italicized in Fig.  ). Silent mutations in these 8\u00a0bp ensured the plasmid would not be targeted by Cas9:sgRNA_847 complexes. This was followed by sequences encoding a FLAG peptide, a Gly-Ser-Gly linker peptide, a P2A self-cleaving peptide, eGFP, and a stop codon, all codon-optimized for   Hydractinia   (Fig.  ). When correctly inserted into the 3\u2032 end of   Eef1a,   we predicted this construct would create a mutant allele,   Eef1a  , resulting in the expression of a Eef1a-FLAG protein and a separate eGFP molecule that would act as a visual marker. Because the repair template did not include a promoter or splice acceptor site, untargeted integration of the plasmid into the genome would be unlikely to result in eGFP expression. \n\nTo test our construct, we injected zygotes with an injection cocktail containing 200\u00a0ng/\u03bcl repair template pUP613 and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl Cas9 complexed with 500\u00a0ng/\u03bcl sgRNA_847 (Fig.\u00a0 ). Pilot experiments comparing injected and non-injected embryos revealed an impact of injection on viability (Additional file  : Figure S2A). Despite this effect, we recovered 321 viable injected embryos (from three independent experiments), of which 14 (4.4%) were eGFP  (Additional file  : Figure S2B). The location of eGFP  expression ranged from several endodermal cells to long streaks of eGFP  cells and remained present up to 144\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf) (Fig.  ). In control experiments in which we injected the repair template alone, we did not observe any eGFP  cells (100 viable, injected embryos). A parallel set of experiments conducted with the same strains of   H. symbiolongicarpus   and the same injection cocktail in the Frank laboratory at the National University of Ireland, Galway also generated eGFP  colonies (unpublished observations).   \neGFP expression following Cas9 injection.   a   Breeding strategy and pedigree of eGFP  colonies described in this paper.

All scale bars\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm \n  \n\nWe subsequently injected embryos and settled only those larvae with many eGFP  cells (  n  \u2009=\u200936). In all cases, we found that eGFP  larvae metamorphosed into primary polyps with eGFP  cells. As they developed into juvenile colonies, several of these animals lost eGFP expression. These were typically primary polyps that possessed few eGFP  cells after metamorphosis. In 15 colonies, however, eGFP expression was stably maintained, albeit mosaic in most colonies. \n\nIn one eGFP  colony, 347\u201310, we observed nearly ubiquitous eGFP expression at sexual maturity. In particular, we noted high levels of eGFP fluorescence in all developing oocytes (Fig.  ), raising the possibility that the   Eef1a   allele might be present in the germline. To test this, we backcrossed colony 347\u201310 to its male parent (Fig.  ). At 24 hpf, 100% of larvae obtained from this cross were eGFP  (Fig.  ), although some appeared slightly dimmer than others (Additional file  : Figure S3A). By 72 hpf, we could clearly distinguish eGFP  from eGFP  larvae (Fig.  ; Additional file  : Figure S3B), suggesting that the eGFP  had received a germline transmitted   Eef1a   allele, while eGFP  fluoresced due to maternal loading of either eGFP mRNA or protein in the oocyte. This low level of eGFP signal remained in the larvae up to 7 days post-fertilization, while eGFP+ larvae accumulated bright eGFP signal, particularly in the endodermal cells (Fig.  ; Additional file  : Figure S3C).\u00a0The eGFP  larvae that we settled developed into eGFP  adults with high levels of eGFP expression, while eGFP  larvae developed into colonies without eGFP expression. \n\nTo further assess the stability of this transgene, we grew several of these eGFP  colonies to sexual maturity and never observed loss of eGFP expression. We then selected a male and a female (Fig.   and  , respectively), backcrossed them to their parents, and crossed them to each other (Fig.  ). At 24 hpf, larvae resulting from the backcross of the male eGFP  colony could readily be classified as eGFP  or eGFP  (not shown). In contrast, larvae resulting from both crosses involving the female eGFP  colony displayed either high or low eGFP signal similar to that observed coming from the founder colony, 347\u201310. This phenotype resolved into eGFP  and eGFP  classes by 72 hpf. At 96 hpf, we counted the number of eGFP  and eGFP  or eGFP  larvae in each cross and confirmed that the inheritance pattern of eGFP expression was consistent with mendelian inheritance of a single   Eef1a   allele from colonies 354\u20133 and 354\u20135 (Table\u00a0 ).   \nMendelian inheritance of eGFP expression in testcrosses \n  \nAs described in Fig.  ;  Expected ratio is indicated in parentheses.  larvae at 96 hpf;   eGFP  larvae were scored as eGFP  in crosses 358 and 359 \n  \n\nTo test for potentially deleterious fitness effects of the   Eef1a   allele, we settled 44 eGFP  and 50 eGFP  larvae from the 357 cross and followed them for 4 weeks. We observed no difference in survival or total area of the mat (a proxy for colony size) between the two groups (Fig.\u00a0 - ). To date, we have continued to culture five animals from the 357 population for 7 months and observed stable eGFP expression in each one. \n\nTo determine whether we had correctly inserted the FLAG-P2A-eGFP cassette into the   Eef1a   locus, we designed PCR primers to amplify the transgene from eGFP  animals. Repeated attempts to amplify the expected\u00a03232\u00a0bp cassette from eGFP  colonies with primers Pr845 and Pr846 were unsuccessful. We concluded this was likely due to preferential amplification of the shorter, unedited   Eef1a   allele. We therefore developed a strategy to amplify each side of the inserted transgene. To avoid amplifying repair template DNA that may have integrated elsewhere in the genome, we designed each primer pair such that one primer annealed to the endogenous   Eef1a   locus outside the region matching the homology arms in pUP613 and the other to the insert (Fig.   and Additional file  : Table S1). Using primers flanking the 5\u2032 homology arm, we were able to amplify a band of the expected size from the founder (347\u201310) and its eGFP  progeny, but not their eGFP  siblings (Fig.  ). We cloned and sequenced these amplicons and found that they matched the expected sequence of the   Eef1a   allele (Additional file  ). Using primers flanking the 3\u2032 homology arm, we were also able to amplify products from eGFP  colonies, but these were smaller than expected. Cloning and sequencing them revealed that they matched expected sequence of the   Eef1a   allele except for a 681\u00a0bp deletion downstream of the   Eef1a   3\u2019 UTR. These experiments confirmed that colonies 354\u20133 and 354\u20135 inherited the same   Eef1a   allele from the founder colony, 347\u201310, but do not entirely rule out the possibility that 347\u201310 was a mosaic possessing multiple edited   Eef1a   alleles. Taken together, these results show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination can be used to introduce exogenous DNA into target sites in the   Hydractinia   genome, and that these sequences can be stably inherited over multiple generations.   \nValidation of homologous recombination at the   Eef1a   locus.   a   Schematic of the expected sequence for the edited region of   Eef1a  .

This strategy could obviate the laborious task of creating and validating antibodies to target proteins for such studies. An additional advantage of using small epitope tags instead of fluorescent fusion proteins is that short tags are less likely to interfere with protein stability and function. To test whether we can specifically detect FLAG-tagged proteins in   Hydractinia   using commercially available reagents, we isolated total protein from transgenic and nontransgenic colonies and probed them with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) in western blots (Fig.\u00a0 ). We observed a strong, specific signal in colonies expressing the Eef1a-FLAG protein, with no detectable background in colonies expressing only untagged Eef1a. The absence of additional bands at the expected size of the intact Eef1a-FLAG-P2A-eGFP protein (80.8\u00a0kDa), even after 60\u00a0min of exposure to film, also demonstrated that the P2A self-cleaving peptide can efficiently separate two peptides in vivo in   Hydractinia.    \nSpecificity of the FLAG octopeptide in   Hydractinia.   Western blot of total protein lysates from   Eef1a   transgenic and nontransgenic colonies. Sizes in italics are the top and bottom bands of the molecular size marker \n  \n\nTo test whether the FLAG octopeptide would be suitable for immunolocalizations, we probed whole mounts of transgenic and non-transgenic gastrozooids with the same anti-FLAG antibodies. We observed strong but diffuse staining in the transgenic polyps (Fig.\u00a0  and Additional files   and  ), which was consistent with ubiquitous cytoplasmic expression of Eef1a-FLAG. In addition, we noted cells with large nuclei and a polygonal morphology sparsely distributed within the body column (Fig.  ). The morphology of these cells was similar to that reported for   Hydractinia   interstitial stem cells (i-cells) (e.g., [ ]). In contrast, we observed very little signal from the non-transgenic control (Fig.   and Additional files   and  ). This signal was dramatically reduced in secondary-only controls (Additional file  : Figure S4), indicating it was likely the result of minimal non-specific staining from the FLAG antibody. These results suggest that tagging endogenous proteins with FLAG epitope tags could be a viable strategy for immunolocalization, provided appropriate controls are performed.   \nImmunolocalization of Eef1a-FLAG.   a  -  d   Eef1a   transgenic gastrozooids fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG primary antibodies and Alexa 647 conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by DAPI, and imaged on a laser scanning confocal microscope.

However, previous work has shown that germline transmitted, randomly integrated transgenes driven by promoters of housekeeping genes can display an expression pattern in which cells appear to either stochastically express or not express the transgene [ ]. The mechanism responsible for this variegated expression pattern is unknown, but for transgenes driven by actin promoters, it can persist even after two generations of germline transmission (ML Nicotra, unpublished data). \n\nTo determine whether the germline transmitted   Eef1a   allele would exhibit similar variegated expression, we investigated its expression in detail. Multiphoton imaging of intact gastrozooids, gonozooids, stolons, and mat edges revealed no evidence of variegated expression in either the epidermal or gastrodermal cell layers (Fig.\u00a0  and Additional files  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  ). The intensity of eGFP signal did not allow us to determine whether expression was uniform across all cell types. We also investigated 120 hpf eGFP  larvae from the 357 cross and found robust eGFP expression in all ectodermal and endodermal cells (Fig.   and Additional files   and  ). We therefore concluded that, as expected, the   Eef1a   transgene is at least expressed in all epithelial cells, with no detectable evidence of variegated expression.   \nNo evidence of variegated expression of the   Eef1a   transgene in epithelial cell layers.   a   Schematic of colony showing orientation of multiphoton micrographs in   b  -  g  .   b  -  g   Multiphoton micrographs of   Eef1a   expressing colonies stained with DAPI.

Therefore, we decided to test the StrepII-FLAG tandem affinity purification (SF-TAP) tag (Fig.\u00a0 ) [ ]. The SF-TAP tag is composed of a doublet Strep II tag followed by a single FLAG peptide and was chosen because it would potentially enable efficient purification of tagged proteins and their interaction partners via tandem affinity purification [ ]. In addition, we replaced the eGFP with tdTomato because it is one of the brightest fluorescent proteins available [ ] and can be used in combination with eGFP during imaging. The resulting repair template (pUP660; Additional file  ) was expected to create an Eef1a-SF peptide and a separate tdTomato peptide.   \nCreation of the   Eef1a   allele.   a   Overview of Cas9-mediated insertional mutagenesis.

Region matching the repair template is shown in gray box.   f   PCR amplification of upstream region from parental and tdTomato  colonies.   g   Primer combinations tested in order to amplify the downstream region of   Eef1a   allele \n  \n\nWe co-injected pUP660 with Cas9:sgRNA_847 complexes into zygotes from parents 291\u201310 and 295\u20138 (Fig.  ). Similar to previous experiments, we observed tdTomato  cells in a portion of the injected embryos at 72 hpf and selected only those larvae with high levels of tdTomato expression for metamorphosis into colonies. Of 38 such colonies, one colony, 350\u201310, developed tdTomato  eggs. In contrast to colony 347\u201310, however, not all eggs were fluorescent, even within the same gonophore (Fig.\u00a0 ). We backcrossed this colony to 291\u201310 and obtained several tdTomato  colonies. \n\nTo validate correct insertion of the SF-P2A-tdTomato cassette, we attempted to amplify regions upstream and downstream of the cassette using a similar PCR-based strategy to that employed for   Eef1a   (Fig.  ). For the upstream region, we obtained bands of the expected size from tdTomato  colonies (Fig.  ), which we cloned and sequenced and found identical to the expected sequence of the edited   Eef1a   allele (Additional file  ). In contrast, we were unable to amplify the downstream region, despite testing 11 PCR primers in 14 pairwise combinations (Fig.  ). These results led us to conclude we had successfully created the   Eef1a   mutant allele and, since tdTomato was functional, that the sequence was intact at least through the stop codon. We could not, however, confirm the sequence of the downstream genomic region. \n\nIn culturing colonies from the 355 population, we also observed a marked fitness defect associated with the   Eef1a   allele. Whereas tdTomato  larvae metamorphosed and grew into robust colonies, their tdTomato  siblings required meticulous hand-feeding for several weeks, died at a high rate, and grew slowly. Despite this defect, we were able to obtain enough tissue to test the suitability of the SF-TAP tag for in vivo protein studies. \n\nWe first tested whether we could detect both tags via in western blots on total cell lysates of tdTomato  and tdTomato  colonies. Using anti-FLAG antibodies, we observed a band of the expected molecular weight for an Eef1a protein bearing a C-terminal SF-TAP tag in an animal bearing a germline transmitted allele, but no signal in the mosaic founder (Fig.\u00a0 ). Using an anti-StrepII monoclonal antibody, we similarly observed a strong signal from the fully transgenic colony and no signal from the mosaic founder. (Fig.  ). After over-exposure on film, however, a faint band appeared for the founder, likely reflecting the small number of properly edited cells in this colony (Fig.  ). In addition, we observed a 15\u00a0kDa band in all colonies, suggesting this antibody cross-reacts with some variants of an endogenous   Hydractinia   protein. These results further confirmed we had, indeed, created the   Eef1a   allele, despite our inability to amplify the downstream genomic region via PCR.   \nUse of the StrepII-FLAG tag in immunoblots and pull-downs.   a   Western blot for FLAG on total protein lysates from   Eef1a   transgenic and nontransgenic colonies.

The blot was treated to induce chemiluminescence and exposed to film for 5\u00a0min (left), followed by a second exposure for 60\u00a0min (right). The 15\u00a0kDa band suggests this antibody cross-reacts with some variants of an endogenous   Hydractinia   protein. Arrowhead indicates non-specific staining of protein ladder.   c   Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel of elutions from Strep-Tactin coated beads following incubation in total protein lysates from the indicated colonies.   d   Western blot against the FLAG peptide on the indicated amount of total protein lysate from colony 355\u20138, before and after incubation with the anti-streptavidin beads. The elution from the beads was run alongside for comparison \n  \n\nFinally, to test whether we could use the SF-TAP tag to purify proteins from the   Hydractinia   proteome, we harvested tissue from transgenic and non-transgenic colonies, prepared whole cell lysates, incubated them with Strep-Tactin conjugated agarose beads, and eluted the bound protein. SDS-PAGE of the elutions followed by coomassie staining revealed a\u00a0band of the expected size for Eef1a-SF from transgenic but not control colonies (Fig.  ). We also observed a faint band smaller than the expected band, which may be a protein that specifically or non-specifically binds to Eef1a (Fig.  ). To test the efficiency of the pull-down, we also probed whole cell lysates before and after the pull down with anti-FLAG antibodies and observed a complete loss of FLAG signal, indicating complete capture of the Eef1a-SF protein (Fig.  ). These results demonstrate the suitability of the StrepII tag to purify in vivo tagged proteins from   Hydractinia  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study demonstrates that it is possible target the insertion of exogenous DNA into the   Hydractinia   genome via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Specifically, we inserted either a FLAG-P2A-eGFP or a SF-P2A-tdTomato coding sequence into the   Eef1a   locus. With moderate effort, we were able to generate mosaic founders that transmitted each transgene through the germline, thus generating fully transgenic animals. We then used these animals to confirm the correct insertion of the reporter construct. Transgene expression in these offspring was stable throughout the duration of our experiments and across two generations of breeding. With this work,   Hydractinia   becomes the first cnidarian to display successful germline transmission of CRISPR/Cas9 generated transgenes and, along with   Nematostella   [ ], only the second cnidarian in which CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homologous recombination has been achieved. \n\nIn both cases of germline transmission in   Hydractinia  , we observed that the genomic regions upstream of the inserted transgene matched the expected sequence, but downstream regions did not. Specifically, we discovered a 681\u00a0bp deletion in the   Eef1a   allele and were unable to amplify the downstream region of the   Eef1a   allele. One interpretation of these results is that homology directed repair (HDR) in   Hydractinia   could be more error-prone than anticipated. Specifically, our results are consistent with a scenario in which the lesion created by Cas9 results in significant alterations to both up- and downstream regions, which are then repaired by HDR or another form of DNA repair. Since we used fluorescence to screen for founder colonies, we were only able to detect transgenic animals in which the upstream regions preserved the reading frame of the reporter. Although the presence of downstream mutations did not create a problem in this study, it could complicate future work that depends on the sequence on both sides of an inserted transgene. It will therefore be important to determine the conditions that promote and/or prevent these mutations. \n\nOne variable that could affect the prevalence of mutations in surrounding regions is the size of the homology arms in the repair template. In this study, we followed the example of Ikmi et al. [ ] and used 1\u00a0kb homology arms. However, homology arms of ~\u2009500\u00a0bp are routinely used to insert 1\u00a0kb transgenes in mammalian cells, while shorter transgenes can be inserted using homology arms as short as 40\u00a0bp and a single stranded oligoDNA template [ ]. Shortening the homology arms in   Hydractinia   might narrow the region available for homologous recombination and thus decrease the odds of recovering animals with large mutations. Further investigating the effect of homology arm length on the efficiency and fidelity of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated HDR in   Hydractinia   will be useful. \n\nOur results demonstrate the feasibility of using short affinity tags to track endogenous proteins in vivo. One immediate application is to tag proteins in order to study their expression via immunolocalization or western blot. We showed here that the FLAG octopeptide is suitable for both applications in   Hydractinia.   This approach could, in some instances, eliminate the need to generate and validate antibodies in order to study a protein of interest. Another potential application is the purification of in vivo expressed proteins to study biochemical features such as post-translational modifications or interaction partners. Using relatively small amounts of tissue (area ~\u20096\u00a0cm ) and a simple incubation procedure with Strep-Tactin beads, we were able to extract all detectable StrepII-tagged Eef1a protein from total cell lysates in sufficient amounts to visualize on a coomassie stained polyacrylamide gel. One caveat to this result is that Eef1a is typically one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells, making it an easy target. Nonetheless, we expect that purifying less abundant proteins will be as simple as increasing the amount of starting tissue, a straightforward task in a clonally reproducing animal like   Hydractinia  . In short, this approach should enable   Hydractinia   researchers to study previously intractable questions regarding protein biochemistry using commercially available reagents. \n\nTo the best of our ability, we have sought to determine whether every cell in a transgenic colony is marked with a fluorescent reporter. In no instance did we see evidence of cells lacking expression of either eGFP or tdTomato when it is placed under control of the endogenous   Eef1a   promoter. This suggests that   Eef1a   will be a useful landing site for the ubiquitous expression of transgenes in future experiments. In addition, animals we generated in this study will be useful in experiments in which it is desirable to track cells over long periods of time in live colonies. Specifically, we expect to be able to use them to track cell migrations following the fusion of colonies with different degrees of histocompatibility. Such experiments will enable us to test previous claims regarding the cell types that migrate within chimeras, the speed and mode by which they migrate, and their ultimate fate [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nWhile our study is a significant advancement for the cnidarian research community, there are several limitations that should be considered. First, we have only demonstrated successful editing at one gene,   Eef1a  . Complications may arise when targeting other loci. Second, we have made little attempt to optimize the microinjection cocktail. Our efficiency might be increased by altering the overall concentrations and/or ratios of donor template, Cas9 protein, and sgRNA. Third, we cannot rule out the possibility that the repair template has been incorporated in the   Hydractinia   genome outside   Eef1a  . In fact, given the demonstrated ease with which exogenous DNA incorporates at random into the   Hydractinia   genome, we suspect other integrations did occur but were not detectable because our transgene was designed to express a functional protein only when integrated into an existing gene in the proper reading frame. Random integrations, if they were to disrupt an endogenous gene, could alter the phenotype of a transgenic colony. Researchers using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to insert transgenes in the future should therefore confirm any link between an observed phenotype and the mutant genotype either by creating knockins in different genetic backgrounds, breeding to confirm that phenotypes co-segregate with the transgene, and/or probing the genomes of transgenic colonies via Southern blots or whole genome resequencing. A fourth limitation is that we observed an obvious deleterious effect in colonies expressing   Eef1a  , but we did not determine whether this was due to toxicity of the tdTomato protein, the fusion of the SF-TAP tag to Eef1a, the SF-TAP tag itself, the potential deletion of the region downstream of   Eef1a  , or some combination of these factors. Testing these possibilities in future work will be straightforward. Finally, we were unable to immunoprecipitate Eef1a-FLAG in these studies. It is likely that insertion of a 3X FLAG tag in the   Eef1a   locus (instead of the 1X tag used in this study) would have allowed for anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. \n\nBeyond this work, the ability to use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to create targeted knockins should enable the   Hydractinia   community to study other genes of interest. It also suggests a more efficient way to screen for gene knockouts because one could design a gene trap with a fluorescent reporter, thus enabling visual screening for mutants, and germline transmitted mutations, rather than laboriously genotyping by PCR. In addition, it should now be possible to begin developing more sophisticated functional genetic tools in   Hydractinia  , including the use of systems such as Cre/lox to create inducible or conditional expression or deletion systems. \n\nFor decades,   Hydractinia   has been studied by a small but dedicated community of scientists asking fundamental biological questions. Are   Hydractinia   stem cells truly pluripotent? Are there limits to the regenerative potential of this species? How does the division of labor and polyp polymorphism evolve in colonial species? What controls colony form during ontogeny? What allows a   Hydractinia   colony to distinguish itself from other colonies so accurately? Do colonies age? We expect that the availability of high throughput genomics and genome editing will speed us toward the answers. Along the way, we hope that established cnidarian researchers and newcomers alike will join the   Hydractinia   community to ask novel questions and enrich our understanding of animal biology. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis work is the first account of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockins in   Hydractinia   and the first example of the germline transmission of a CRISPR/Cas9 inserted transgene in a cnidarian  .   We expect this technology, when combined with high quality genomic resources and the logistical feasibility of genetic studies, will make   Hydractinia   a widely used model system for functional genomics. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Animal care and breeding \n  \n H. symbiolongicarpus   was maintained at the University of Pittsburgh. Colonies were grown on glass microscope slides and cultured in 38\u00a0liter aquaria filled with artificial seawater (Instant Ocean Reef Crystals) between 28 and 31\u00a0ppt and maintained at 22\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C. Adult colonies were fed 3-day-old   Artemia   nauplii (Brine Shrimp Direct) on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesday and Thursday, colonies were fed a suspension of pureed oysters (fresh caught, shucked, pureed, then stored frozen). Breeding colonies were kept on a day/night cycle of 8\u00a0h light, 16\u00a0h dark. Following their first exposure to light, male and female colonies were placed in separate 3\u00a0liter bins, where they released sperm or eggs 1\u20131.5\u00a0h later. Within 20\u00a0min of spawning, eggs were harvested by filtering water from the female bin through a 20\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer, and sperm was harvested by collecting 10\u201315\u00a0ml from the male container. Sperm and eggs were mixed together with an additional 15\u00a0ml artificial seawater in a 100\u00a0mm polystyrene petri dish, where fertilization occurred. For crosses not involving microinjection, embryos were allowed to develop into planula larvae and were settled 72\u201396\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf). Metamorphosis was induced by incubating the larvae in 56\u00a0mM CsCl in filtered seawater for 4\u20136\u00a0h, and then transferring them with glass pipettes onto 25\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u00a0mm glass microscope slides. Three days later, larvae that successfully metamorphosed primary polyps were hand-fed pieces of 3-day-old   Artemia   nauplii. Hand feeding continued daily until polyps were able to catch and eat whole   Artemia   nauplii on their own, whereupon they were fed identically to the adult colonies as detailed above. \n\n\n### Identification and cloning of   Eef1a  \n  \nPreviously published   H. symbiolongicarpus   RNA-Seq data [ ] were used to identify the   Eef1a   sequence. The   Eef1a   genomic sequence was identified by BLAST searches against a draft genome of 291\u201310 [ ]. BLAST databases were created and searched using using BLAST+\u20092.4 [ ]. The genomic region encoding exons 3\u20134 of the 295\u20138   Eef1a   alleles (Additional file  ) were PCR-amplified using primers P845 and Pr846 (Additional file  : Table S1) and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher F530). PCR products were gel purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen 28,706), cloned using the Blunt II TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen K2800), and then sequenced. \n\n\n### Genomic DNA extraction \n  \nColonies were starved for at least 2 days before to DNA extraction. Tissue was harvested by scraping it from slide with a razor blade and transferring it into a 1.5\u00a0ml microcentrifuge tube, briefly centrifuging at max speed (>\u200921,000\u00a0g), pipetting off the seawater, and storing at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C until extraction. To extract genomic DNA, UEB1 buffer (7\u00a0M urea, 0.3125\u00a0M NaCl, 0.05\u00a0M Tris-HCl, 0.02\u00a0M EDTA, and 1% w:v N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) was added to the tissue, which was then ground with a pestle and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. This was followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with 2.5 volumes 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume 5\u00a0M sodium acetate (pH\u00a05.2). The precipitate was pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended with TE. RNA was removed by adding 1/100th volume of Ambion RNAse cocktail (Ambion #AM2286) and incubating at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. This was followed by another ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was pelleted, washed with 70% EtOH, resuspended with TE, and diluted to a working stock concentration of 25\u00a0ng/\u03bcl. \n\n\n###  Eef1a   CRISPR target sequence selection \n  \nBefore designing the repair template plasmid, a CRISPR target sequence needed to be selected. The genomic sequence of all four   Eef1a   alleles spanning primers Pr845 and Pr846 were aligned using Clustal\u03a9 [ ]. From this alignment (Additional file  ), the 3\u2032-most PAM motif prior to the stop codon was identified and the preceding 20 nucleotides were selected as the CRISPR target sequence (sgRNA_847; Fig.   and Additional file  : Table S1). To check for any obvious off-target potential, sgRNA_847 was blasted against the previously described BLAST database of the 291\u201310 draft genome. BLAST alignments were manually inspected for significant matches (>\u200915 consecutive matching bases, starting at the first base prior the start of the PAM motif). Aside from the two 291\u201310   Eef1a   alleles, no significant matches were found elsewhere in the genome. \n\n\n### Construct design and synthesis \n  \nThe Eef1a-FLAG-P2A-eGFP donor plasmid was assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly kit (NEB E5520). The upstream and downstream homology arms were amplified by PCR from colony 291\u201310 using primers P845 and Pr846 (Additional file  : Table S1). The   Hydractinia   codon optimized eGFP sequence was PCR amplified from pAct-I:51Act-eGFP [ ]. Nucleotide sequences of the FLAG tag and P2A self cleaving peptide [ ] were first codon optimized using a codon usage table generate from a publicly available   H. symbiolongicarpus   transcriptome [ ] and synthesized as oligoDNA primers to be incorporated into the plasmid during Gibson assembly. The Eef1a-SF-P2A-tdTomato donor plasmid was assembled in a similar fashion. The SF-TAP sequence [ ] was codon optimized and synthesized as an oligoDNA primer for assembly while a   Hydractinia   codon-optimized tdTomato sequence was amplified from a plasmid obtained from the Frank lab. These sequences were assembled and cloned using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly kit and sequenced to validate the assembly (Additional file  ). Plasmid DNA for microinjection was prepared using the GeneJET Plasmid Midiprep kit (ThermoFisher K0481), followed by an additional phenol/chloroform purification, ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation, and resuspension in 1X TE at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl. The plasmid was then diluted with a working buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES; 150\u00a0mM KCl, pH\u00a07.5) to a final concentration of 600\u00a0ng/\u03bcl, and stored at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C. \n\n\n### Microinjection \n  \nTo prepare embryos for microinjection, a cross was performed as described above. After allowing fertilization to take place in the 100\u00a0mm dish for 15\u00a0min, the fertilized eggs were washed three times with filtered seawater in a 50\u00a0ml conical tube to remove excess sperm and remnants of the jelly coat. Washed embryos were then loaded onto a glass microscope slide and injected until the first cell cleavage began. \n\nThe microinjection cocktail was prepared prior to injection. Recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio) and a synthetic sgRNA (Synthego) were combined and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, after which the donor plasmid was added. The final injection cocktail consisted of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl Cas9, 500\u00a0ng/\u03bcl sgRNA, and 200\u00a0ng/\u03bcl donor plasmid. Immediately before injection, the cocktail was centrifuged at max speed (>\u200921,000\u00a0g) for approx. 5\u00a0min to pellet precipitates and particles that would clog the injection needle. The supernatant was then loaded into the microinjection needle and injected into single-cell   Hydractinia   embryos using a FemtoJet (Eppendorf) microinjection system. \n\n\n### Tissue fixation and Immunolocalization \n  \nTo prepare fixed tissue, animals were anaesthetized with menthol crystals (Sigma M2772) or 2% urethane in seawater, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in seawater for 1\u00a0h at room temperature (RT) or overnight (ON) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Tissue was permeabilized by washing three times with PBS\u2009+\u20090.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. For immunolocalizations, all steps were carried out at RT unless stated otherwise. Following fixation tissues were then blocked in 3% BSA/PBST (two incubations, 30\u00a0min each), incubated ON at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma F1804) in 3% BSA/PBST, washed with PBST (three washes, 10\u00a0min each), blocked in 3% BSA/5% goat serum/PBST for 30\u00a0min, incubated for 1\u00a0h with a 1:1000 dilution of an Alexa 647 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ThermoFisher A-21235) in 3% BSA/5% goat serum/PBST, and washed with PBST (three washes, 10\u00a0min each). Nuclei were then stained ON at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DAPI, washed with PBST (three washes at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min each), and mounted in Gelvatol mounting medium [ ] prior to imaging. \n\n\n### Microscopy \n  \nImages of live colonies were collected on an Olympus macroscope fitted with a 1X objective equipped with a Retiga camera and controlled by Nikon NIS Elements software. Three dimensional images of larvae collected using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope in galvanometer scanning mode with an ELWD 40\u00d7 water objective (NA 1.12) with Nyquist sampling in X,Y and Z. Images were rendered and stitched using NIS elements. Confocal images of other tissues were acquired on a Nikon A1 scanning confocal microscope with 20X air objectives (NA 0.75). For multiphoton microscopy, we used a Nikon A1R MP microscope configured with the Nikon Ni-E (Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) upright motorized system. The microscope was equipped with a Chameleon Laser Vision (Coherent, Inc., CA, USA) tuned to 850\u00a0nm for GFP excitation, an APO LWD 25\u00d7 water immersion objective with 1.1 NA, a high-speed (30 frames/s) resonant scanning mode and a galvano scanning mode suitable for linescanning acquisitions. The Nano-Drive system was used to acquire fine high speed control of z-plane selection. The fluorescence detection unit of the microscope consisted of four detectors (photo multiplying tubes). We used detector 2 for eGFP 525/50\u00a0nm (green channel). The microscope components including the laser, stage, resonant scanning head, detectors and acquisition were controlled using NIS Elements software (Nikon). Post-processing was carried out in NIS Elements software (v. 4.5) and exported as TIFF files. All adjustments were applied equally to the entire image. \n\n\n### Colony area estimation \n  \nColony area estimated by visualizing live colonies with a Leica M80 stereoscope at 10X magnification and acquiring color images in JPEG format with a Leica IC80HD camera. Images were imported into ImageJ as implemented in Fiji [ ]. This was converted into a binary black and white image by adjusting the threshold level until all pixels within the colony perimeter were black and the background remained white. The \u201cAnalyzed Particles\u201d command was then used to compute the area of the colony. The scale was determined by imaging a ruler at the same magnification. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism. \n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nGenomic inserts were amplified using the Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB catalog M0492). To amplify each junction, PCR primers were designed so that one of the primers is tethered to the endogenous gDNA sequence of the EF1-\u03b1 locus and the paired primer to the insert (Figs.   and  ). For a 50\u00a0\u03bcL PCR, 100\u00a0ng of gDNA was used. PCRs were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. PCR products were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (ThermoFisher K0701), cloned using the Blunt II TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen K2800), and then sequenced. \n\n\n### Protein extraction \n  \nTotal protein was extracted from whole colonies of   H. symbiolongicarpus  . Prior to tissue collection, a lysis buffer consisting of RIPA buffer (Sigma R0278), 1\u00a0mM AEBSF, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml pepstatin A, 5\u00a0mM EDTA pH\u00a08, 1\u00a0mM EGTA pH\u00a08, and 1X cOmplete\u2122 EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tabs (Roche #11836170001) was prepared. Colonies were excised from glass slides, collected in eppendorf tubes, and briefly centrifuged at max speed (>\u200921,000\u00a0g) to allow excess seawater to be removed. Then the lysis buffer was added and the tissue ground with a pestle and incubated on ice for 10\u201320\u00a0min. Lysates were then centrifuged at max speed (>\u200921,000\u00a0g) for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Lysate was decanted into a new tube and placed on ice. Protein was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher 23,225), diluted with 4\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer (with either 2-mercaptoethanol or DTT), boiled for 5\u00a0min at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, aliquoted, and stored at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C. \n\n\n### Immunoblotting \n  \nFor western blotting, a total of 10\u00a0\u03bcg of protein was run on Novex 10% Tris-Glycine mini gels (ThermoFisher XP00105BOX). Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad 1620177) using the Pierce G2 Fast Blotter. Blots were probed according to the supplier\u2019s recommended protocol for the following antibodies: anti-actin (Sigma A2066), anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804), and anti-StrepII (MBL International catalog #M211\u20133). Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase and anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase; Sigma A0168 and A0545, respectively) were used at 1:10,000 dilution. Signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (ThermoFisher 34,078), exposed to Carestream Biomax XAR Film (Sigma 1,651,454), and developed using a Konica SRX-101A tabletop processor. \n\n\n### Pull-down assays \n  \nImmunoprecipitations (IPs) on FLAG-P2A-eGFP expressing colonies were performed using Anti-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma M8823) following the supplier\u2019s recommended protocol. For lysates from SF-P2A-tdTomato expressing colonies, pull-downs were performed using MagStrep \u201ctype3\u201d XT magnetic beads (IBA 2\u20134090-002). Total protein was extracted as described above. Total volume of the lysate was approx. 1\u00a0ml, this was added to 1\u00a0\u03bcl of equilibrated beads and incubated ON at 4\u00a0\u00b0C turning end-over-end. Lysate was removed and beads were washed three times at RT using 1\u00a0ml of Strep-Tactin XT Wash Buffer (IBA 2\u20131003-100). After final wash, beads were moved into a clean eppendorf tube and eluted by incubating beads with 30\u00a0\u03bcl Strep-Tactin XT Elution Buffer (IBA 2\u20131042-025) for 10\u00a0min at RT with periodic vortexing. Eluted protein was diluted with 4\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer (with DTT), boiled for 5\u00a0min at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, and stored at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C. \n\nIPs and pull-downs were analyzed by both coomassie staining and immunoblotting (as described above). For coomassie staining, 35\u00a0\u03bcl of the eluate was run on a Novex 10% Tris-Glycine mini gel. The gel was then fixed for 10\u00a0min (10% acetic acid, 25% IPA) at RT, stained ON at RT in a 0.3% solution of G250 Brilliant Blue coomassie (BioRad 161\u20130406), destained with 10% acetic acid for approx. Two hours, and then imaged. \n\n\n\n## Additional files \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6122657, "text_md5": "fd54161377601cd8599aa37a1ecb7909", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 231], "journal": [232, 244], "publication_year": [246, 250], "title": [261, 339], "keywords": [353, 460], "abstract": [473, 2024], "body": [2033, 57627]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30176818, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-018-5032-z", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122657", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6122657"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122657\">6122657</a>", "list_title": "PMC6122657  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockin in the hydroid Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus"}

While theoretically appealing, there is little direct evidence for tool embodiment at the neural level. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in male and female human subjects, we investigated whether expert tool users (London litter pickers:   n   = 7) represent their expert tool more like a hand (neural embodiment) or less like a hand (neural differentiation), as compared with a group of tool novices (  n   = 12). During fMRI scans, participants viewed first-person videos depicting grasps performed by either a hand, litter picker, or a non-expert grasping tool. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), differences in the representational structure of hands and tools were measured within occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). Contrary to the neural embodiment theory, we find that the experts group represent their own tool less like a hand (not more) relative to novices. Using a case-study approach, we further replicated this effect, independently, in five of the seven individual expert litter pickers, as compared with the novices. An exploratory analysis in left parietal cortex, a region implicated in visuomotor representations of hands and tools, also indicated that experts do not visually represent their tool more similar to hands, compared with novices. Together, our findings suggest that extensive tool use leads to an increased neural differentiation between visual representations of hands and tools. This evidence provides an important alternative framework to the prominent tool embodiment theory. \n\n SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   It is commonly thought that tool use leads to the assimilation of the tool into the neural representation of the body, a process referred to as embodiment. Here, we demonstrate that expert tool users (London litter pickers) neurally represent their own tool less like a hand (not more), compared with novices. Our findings advance our current understanding for how experience shapes functional organization in high-order visual cortex. Further, this evidence provides an alternative framework to the prominent tool embodiment theory, suggesting instead that experience with tools leads to more distinct, separable hand and tool representations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExperience using tools is commonly thought to lead to an integration between the neural representations of the body and the tool, a process known as embodiment ( ). While theoretically appealing, there is little direct evidence for tool embodiment at the neural level. Previous research assessing tool embodiment, such as the influential work of Iriki and colleagues ( ), measured whether tool use affects the visual representation of hand-centered space (e.g., multisensory peripersonal space;  ). However, this is an indirect measure of hand representation and is therefore open to alternative interpretations ( ). Additionally, a more recent tool embodiment approach using electroencephalography (EEG) examined how tactile information carried by a hand-held tool is processed by the somatosensory system as compared with the hand itself ( ). But considering that the tool is held by the hand, it is not clear whether this low-level representation is actually attributable to the tool, or more likely, to the mechanoreceptors in the hand that mediate this information. As such, there is still not a strong proof of concept in the literature that tool use leads to sensory embodiment. \n\nHere, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain decoding to directly quantify similarities between visual representations of hands and tools in expert tool users and novices. We studied individuals with extensive experience using a litter picking tool (expert tool users) as well as a group of novice litter picker users. We specifically chose to study expert tool users, based on the assumption that the extensive tool use of the experts would make them most likely to embody their tools. During fMRI scans, participants viewed first-person videos depicting grasps performed by either a hand, litter picker, or a non-expert grasping tool (tongs). Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), differences in the representational structure across hands and tools were measured within occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). We specifically focused on OTC because it contains spatially overlapping, but distinct, representations for hands and tools ( ). OTC has also been closely linked in visuomotor ( ) and multisensory hand representations ( ) and has also been associated with hand embodiment under the rubber hand illusion ( ). As such, it provides a perfect test bed for investigating tool embodiment. Additionally, to test whether a different result would potentially be observed within neural structures directly implicated in motor planning and execution for hand use and tool use ( ), an exploratory analysis was performed in left parietal cortex. We focused on the left hemisphere because motor planning/tool use has been shown to be left-lateralized in parietal cortex ( ;  ). \n\nUnder the theoretical framework that defines neural embodiment as the successful integration of brain resources typically devoted to control the body to represent and operate external objects (e.g., tools, prosthetic limbs;  ;  ), we proposed three predictions for what we might observe: (1) experts could represent the expert tool more like a hand compared with novices, i.e., neural embodiment, (2) experts could represent the expert tool less like a hand compared with novices, i.e., neural differentiation or (3) experts could show no differences compared with novices (  A  ). Interestingly, we found that, contrary to the neural embodiment theory, expert tool users represent the expert tool less like a hand, i.e., greater neural dissimilarity between the visual representations of the expert tool and hands within OTC, compared with the novices. Using   method, a modified   t   test, we independently replicated this effect in five of seven individual expert litter pickers, as compared with the novices. Further, we found that this result could not be explained by the low-level representational structure captured in primary visual cortex (V1). An exploratory analysis in left parietal cortex revealed a similar pattern as OTC. These findings provide a novel framework for how tool use shapes the representational structure of hands and tools, such that extensive tool use leads to a more distinct tool representation, as compared with the hand, throughout the visuomotor network. Collectively, this evidence provides an important alternative framework to the tool embodiment theory. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTo identify \u201cexpert\u201d litter pickers, recruitment adverts were distributed with multiple relevant individuals/groups: sanitation supervisors stationed in London Underground stations (e.g., King's Cross St. Pancras, Westminster, Camden, Russell Square etc.), Heads of Parks and Sanitation at several UK city councils (e.g., Islington, Camden, Brighton, and Hove), and with several volunteer litter picking organizations: Keep Britain Tidy, Litter Action, CleanupUK, Helping Hand Environmental, and the Dorset Devils. From these advertisements, 52 respondents were screened via a telephone interview or online survey. From this group, 13% of respondents [  n   = 7; mean age (SD) = 47 (8.11), four females, all right-handed, mean years of education (SD) = 15.9 (1.57)] were invited to participate in the study, based on their litter picking usage being above a minimum threshold (composite score of their previous litter picking use and their current litter picking usage) and compatibility with MRI safety regulations. We also recruited a group of novices matched in age [  n   = 15; mean age (SD) = 43 (7.39), three females, 1 left-handed, mean years of education (SD) = 14.8 (1.86)]. All participant demographics are reported in  . Recruitment was conducted in accordance with University College London's research ethics committee (Ref: 9937/001). Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained in accordance with ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). Three novices were excluded from fMRI data analysis because they did not complete all of the functional runs, because of feelings of anxiety and claustrophobia. \n  \nParticipant demographics \n    \n\n### Litter picking usage measurements \n  \nParticipants were asked to estimate their frequency of using a litter picking on a weekly and daily basis, as well as to estimate how long they have been using a litter picker. Litter picking usage habits are summarized below in  . Participants were not asked to report their previous experience with the non-expert tool (tongs). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \n#### fMRI task stimuli \n  \nFor the main functional task, participants viewed first-person videos of grasping actions being performed using three different effector categories: hands, litter pickers (expert tool) and tongs (non-expert tool). The stimuli included 48 unique videos. Of the 48 videos, there were 16 videos for each effector category. Half of the videos (eight per effector) were presented as left-handed and the other half as right-handed. For the 8 videos for each effector category, videos varied in multiple features: scene context [common scenes typical for hand or tool actions: street (tool), grass (tool), kitchenette (hand), desk (hand)], as well as the size of the object being grasped (small vs large; for example, a small object used was a train ticket and a large object used was a tennis ball; to access all of the videos see  ). A fourth effector, prosthetic hands, was also included in the design. However, this condition was included as part of a separate study involving amputee participants. \n\nSeparately, for the functional localizer scan, participants viewed videos of tools, hands, and two types of control categories: objects and low-level visual control stimuli (to access the full functional localizer video see  ). \n\n\n#### fMRI task design \n  \nFor the main functional task, the presentation of the stimuli was counter-balanced across the four functional runs, to best control for pairwise order effects. Each functional run was 7 min 26 s in length. Within each run, each video was presented once. Each video was displayed for 3.0 s, followed by 2.5 s of a red fixation point against a gray background. Additionally, catch trials were introduced to keep subjects engaged throughout the scan, where an image of a leprechaun face would randomly appear on the center of the screen. Participants were instructed (before starting the task) to wiggle their toes whenever a leprechaun face appeared. These trials were modeled separately and excluded from further analyses. The videos were constructed using MoviePy, a python package for video editing ( ). Stimuli were presented on a screen located at the rear end of the MRI scanner and were viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil. The videos were presented via VLC player ( ) on a Dell Latitude laptop. \n\nFor the functional localizer scan, participants were instructed to maintain fixation on a cross in the center of the screen that was visible throughout the experiment. The localizer run began and ended with a 20-s fixation baseline, followed by five experimental blocks of five 21-s blocks (four experimental blocks and one baseline block), ending with another 20-s fixation baseline (for a total run duration of 9 min, 20 s). The order of blocks was semi-counterbalanced across the five sets. Each block of the video conditions was comprised of three videos of 7 s each, with each video depicting a different exemplar of the condition. \n\n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nThe MRI measurements were obtained using a 3-Tesla Quattro scanner (Siemens) with a 32-channel head coil. Anatomical data were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) with the parameters: TR = 2.54 s, TE = 3.34 ms, FOV = 256 mm, flip angle = 7\u00b0, and voxel size = 1-mm isotropic resolution. Functional data based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal were acquired using a multiband gradient echo-planar T2*-weighted pulse sequence ( ) with the parameters: TR = 1.5 s, TE = 35 ms, flip-angle = 70\u00b0, multiband acceleration factor = 4, FOV = 212 mm, matrix size of 106 \u00d7 106, and voxel size = 2-mm isotropic resolution. Seventy-two slices, with a slice thickness of 2 mm and no slice gap, were oriented in the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure, covering the whole cortex, with partial coverage of the cerebellum. Each of the four functional runs comprising the main task consisted of 298 volumes (7 min, 26 s). For the functional localizer, there was one functional run consisting of 374 volumes. For all functional scans, the first dummy volume of every run was saved and later used as a reference for co-registration. \n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data processing was conducted using FMRIB's expert analysis tool (FEAT; version 6.0), part of FMRIB's software library (FSL;  ) and Connectome Workbench (humanconnectome.org) software, in combination with MATLAB scripts (R2019b, v9.7; The MathWorks Inc), both developed in-house (including an FSL-compatible RSA toolbox;  ) and as part of the RSA Toolbox ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nRegistration of the functional data to the high-resolution structural image was conducted using the boundary-based registration algorithm ( ). Registration of the high resolution structural to standard space images was conducted using FMRIB's linear image registration tool (FLIRT;  ;  ) and was then further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration ( , ). The following prestatistical processing was applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ), non-brain removal using BET ( ), spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 3 mm for the functional task data and 5 mm for the functional hand-tool localizer, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor, and high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with \u03c3 = 50 s). Further, to minimize potential biases from individual runs, the functional data across the individual runs was aligned to a functional mid-space using FLIRT ( ;  ). This functional mid-space was later used to align the parameter estimates and residuals, from each run, to the same functional space for the RSA. \n\n\n### Low-level task-based analysis \n  \nWe applied a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in FEAT, to each functional run. For the main analysis, left and right-handed versions of the same videos were modeled together against rest (fixation). Time-series statistical analysis was conducted using FILM with local autocorrelation correction ( ). The time series model included trial onsets convolved with a double \u03b3 HRF function; six motion parameters were added as confound regressors. Trials for each video condition were modeled separately, except left-handed and right-handed videos were modeled together. Indicator functions were added to model out single volumes identified to have excessive motion (>1 mm). A separate regressor was used for each high motion volume, no more than eight volumes were found for an individual run (2.1% of the entire run). Additionally, in the supplementary analysis exploring the effects of video laterality, videos were modeled separately for each effector category and whether they were left-handed or right-handed against rest (fixation) and averaged across the other features (context and object size). We further used this analysis to confirm our main analysis for group differences in effector category distances. \n\nFor the functional localizer scan, a single contrast for the conditions of interest were defined as hands + tools > objects + low-level visual stimulus. The activity patterns associated with this contrast were then used to define functional regions of interest (ROIs). \n\nFor each participant, parameter estimates of the different effector categories and GLM residuals of all voxels within the ROI were extracted from each run's first-level analysis. For each participant, the parameter estimates and GLM residuals from each run were then aligned to the functional mid-space using FLIRT ( ;  ). The subsequent RSA analysis was conducted within this functional mid-space. \n\n\n### Defining ROIs \n  \n#### OTC \n  \nUsing functional MRI data collected from a separate, independent group of controls (  n   = 20) that viewed the same functional hand-tool localizer (described above), a whole brain group activation map for the contrast hands and tools over moving objects and low-level visual stimulus was constructed. This group map revealed a large cluster covering OTC (  z  -threshold of 3.1). This cluster was isolated, binarized and registered to the functional space of the functional localizer scan using FLIRT. Since the focus of the study was on identifying hand and tool selective voxels within OTC, the analysis was restricted to individually defined ROIs within this large OTC map defined by the independent group of controls. Using the functional localizer data, for each participant in the present study, a hand and tool selective ROI within the large OTC map was defined by selecting the top 100 voxels in each hemisphere showing the strongest greatest preference to videos of hands and tools over moving objects and low-level visual stimulus for each participant. In total, the OTC ROI included 200 voxels: 100 in the left hemisphere and 100 in the right hemisphere. These individually defined ROIs were then transformed from the functional space of the functional localizer scan to the functional mid-space of the functional task scans (described above). \n\n\n#### V1 \n  \nThe V1 ROI was derived from the Juelich Histologic Atlas (GM Visual Cortex V1 BA17 L and R) maximum probabilistic map (unthresholded). Each V1 hemisphere ROI was binarized and transformed from MNI space to the functional space of the functional localizer scan using FLIRT. To identify visually active voxels within each ROI, using the independent hand-tool functional data, the top 100 most activated voxels, in each hemisphere, were selected based on the contrast of all video conditions > baseline. In total, the V1 ROI included 200 voxels: 100 in the left hemisphere and 100 in the right hemisphere. These individually defined ROIs were then transformed from the functional space of the functional localizer scan to the functional mid-space of the functional task scans. ROIs from all participants were superimposed. \n\n\n#### Left parietal cortex \n  \nAs an exploratory analysis, the analysis performed in OTC was conducted in left parietal cortex. Using the functional MRI data collected from the separate, independent group of controls (  n   = 20) that viewed the same functional hand-tool localizer (described above for OTC), a whole brain group activation map for the contrast hands and tools over moving objects and low-level visual stimulus was constructed. This group map revealed a large cluster covering parietal cortex (  z  -threshold of 3.1). The left parietal cortex cluster was isolated, binarized and registered to the functional space of the functional localizer scan using FLIRT. Since the focus of the study was on identifying hand and tool selective relevant voxels, the analysis was restricted to individually defined ROIs within the large left parietal map. To identify hand and tool selective voxels within this map, the top 200 most activated voxels within the left parietal hand-tool conjunction map were selected, for each participant, based on a hands + tools > objects + low-level visual stimulus contrast. These individually defined ROIs were then transformed from the functional space of the functional localizer scan to the functional mid-space of the functional task scans. ROIs from all participants were superimposed. \n\n\n\n### RSA \n  \nTo assess the hand-tool representation structure within the ROI, we used a mutlitvariate approach, RSA, where pairwise representational dissimilarity distances between individual videos were calculated ( ). For each participant, parameter estimates of the individual videos and GLM residuals of all voxels within the ROI were extracted from each run's first-level analysis. To increase the reliability of the distance estimates, parameter estimates underwent multidimensional normalization based on the voxels' covariance matrix calculated from the GLM residuals. This was done to ensure that parameter estimates from noisier voxels will be down-weighted ( ). Cross-validated (leave-one-run-out) Mahalanobis distances [also known as linear discriminant contrast (LDC);  ;  ] were then calculated between each pair of videos. Analysis was run on adapted version of the RSA toolbox in MATLAB ( ), customized for FSL ( ). \n\nFor OTC, this analysis was performed separately for each participant and ROI (left OTC, right OTC), resulting in pairwise dissimilarity distance values comparing each video condition (note that left-handed and right-handed videos were modeled together in this analysis). These distance values for each ROI were inputted into a mixed level ANOVA (described later in statistical analyses). Because of no significant interaction with ROI (left OTC, right OTC), the resulting values for left and right OTC were averaged for each participant, for visualization purposes. These distance values were then depicted as a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), where each element in the RDM corresponds to a single pairwise dissimilarity distance value. The group RDMs (  A  ) were constructed through averaging each pairwise distance element in the matrix of each participant for each group (novices, experts). Additionally, multidimensional scaling plots (to access see  ) were derived from these group RDMs. MDS projects the higher-dimensional RDM into a lower (2D) dimensional space. Note that MDS is presented for intuitive visualization purposes only and was not used for statistical analysis. For V1, the same analysis parameters were used, except the RSA was performed across both hemispheres. For parietal cortex, the same analysis parameters for OTC were used, except we only analyzed the left hemisphere. \n\nFor the laterality RSA analysis, the analysis was performed twice: separately for the average parameter estimates for left-handed and right-handed stimuli. Cross-validated (leave-run-out) Mahalanobis distances were calculated between the parameter estimates for each pair of conditions (e.g., for left-handed stimuli: left-handed hands, left-handed litter pickers, left-handed tongs). Specifically, for the laterality analysis performed in OTC, this was done separately in each OTC hemisphere for each participant, resulting in 4 RDMs: left-handed stimuli in left OTC, right-handed stimuli in left OTC, left-handed stimuli in right OTC, right-handed stimuli in right OTC. The group RDMs for each of these brain regions were constructed through averaging each pairwise distance element in the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix of each participant for each group (novices, experts). Again, for parietal cortex, the same analysis parameters for OTC were used, except we only analyzed the left hemisphere (i.e., no within subject-factor of ROI in the mixed-model ANOVA). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nAll statistical testing was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh (version 24), with the exception of the Bayesian analysis which was run on JASP (version 0.11.1;  ) Tests for normality were conducted using a Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. For statistical analyses of RSA measures in OTC, a mixed level ANOVA (after testing for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test,   p   > 0.05) was performed with the within-subject factors: effector category distances (hands \u2194 litter pickers, hand \u2194 tongs, litter pickers \u2194 tongs) and ROI (left OTC, right OTC) and a between subject factor group (novices, experts). For the secondary OTC analysis that controlled for low-level representational structure captured in V1, the same parameters for the OTC mixed level ANOVA described above were used; however, the average effector category distance outputted from V1 for each participant was used as a covariate. For V1, a mixed level ANOVA (after testing for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test,   p   > 0.05) was performed with the within-subject factors: effector category distances (hands \u2194 litter pickers, hand \u2194 tongs, litter pickers \u2194 tongs) and a between subject factor group (novices, experts). For the OTC laterality analysis, each participant's cross-effector category distances from each of the two RDMs for each ROI (left OTC, right OTC) were inputted into a mixed level ANOVA (after testing for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test,   p   > 0.05) was performed with the within-subject factors included: effector category distances (hands \u2194 litter pickers, hand \u2194 tongs, litter pickers \u2194 tongs), laterality (left-handed or right-handed) and ROI (left OTC, right OTC) and a between subject factor group (novices, experts). \n\nFor the left parietal cortex RSA analyses, the same ANOVA parameters were used as OTC, except there was no within-subject factor of ROI. Within all of the above analyses, to explore the group differences in pairwise effector category distance pairs, two-tailed independent samples   t   tests and two-tailed Bayesian independent samples   t   tests were performed. The Cauchy prior width was set at 0.707 (default;  ). We interpreted the test based on the well accepted criterion of Bayes factor smaller than 1/3 ( ) as supporting the null hypothesis. The strength of evidence was interpreted based on the classification provided in ( ), where a Bayes factor above 10 (or below 0.1) is considered as strong evidence. Additionally, as an exploratory analysis to characterize the supporting evidence for tool embodiment in left parietal cortex, one-tailed Bayesian independent samples   t   tests were performed. The alternative hypothesis was defined as \u201cexperts have smaller dissimilarity distances between hands and the expert tool (litter pickers) than novices,\u201d i.e., novices > experts. \n\nTo test whether an individual expert litter picker's hands \u2194 litter pickers distance was significantly different from the novices, we used   method which provides a point estimate of the abnormality of the individual case's distance from a control sample, as well as a confidence interval of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate ( ). To account for interindividual differences not directly related to hand-tool representation, we first subtracted each participant's hands \u2194 litter pickers distance by their litter pickers \u2194 tongs distance. The analysis was performed using the Singlims.exe program ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFirst, to investigate whether experience with a hand-held tool leads to tools being embodied, we recruited individuals with extensive experience using a litter picking tool (  n   = 7, identified from 52 screened litter pickers; see participant demographics in  ). To quantify whether the expert litter pickers neurally embody the litter picker, we used fMRI in combination with RSA to measure differences in the representational structure of hands and tools. During fMRI scans, participants viewed first-person videos of grasping actions being performed by three effector categories: hands, litter pickers (expert tool) and tongs (non-expert tool). Videos were visually matched across the effector categories. Videos also varied in multiple features: scene context [common scenes typical for hand or tool actions: street (tool), grass (tool), kitchenette (hand), desk (hand)], object sizes (small, large), and the laterality of stimuli (left-handed or right-handed; for screenshots of the videos, see   B  ). Next, individualized hand and tool selective ROIs within OTC were independently localized for each participant by choosing the 100 OTC voxels in each hemisphere showing the strongest preference to videos of hands and tools over moving objects and low-level visual stimulus (  C  ). \n  \nNeuroimaging hypotheses and experimental paradigm.    A   , An illustration of the predictions generated by the proposed hypotheses for the neuroimaging experiment. Under the first, embodiment prediction, extensive tool use could lead to representations of hands and tools to become neurally integrated, such that tools are represented more similarly to hands, suggesting that tools are embodied. A second prediction is that experts will show greater categorization of representations of hands and tools, such that the neural representations for hands and tools would become differentiated and more dissimilar to each other. This would suggest that perhaps that visual experience with tools leads to an increased sharpening of the representation.    B   , Examples of the video stimuli shown during the fMRI scan depicting grasping actions performed by each effector category: hands, litter pickers, or tongs [the videos can be downloaded on the Open Science Framework (OSF) at  ]. To control for any potential laterality effects, the stimuli included both left and right-handed versions.    C   , ROI probability map for all participants (  n   = 19) showing hand and tool selective OTC, defined using independent functional data. For each participant and hemisphere, the top 100 most activated voxels of OTC were selected based on a hands + tools > objects + low-level visual stimulus contrast. ROIs from all participants were superimposed. Warmer colors represent voxels that were included in a greater number of individual ROIs. Group-specific probability maps of OTC can be downloaded on the Open Science Framework at  . \n  \n### Expert tool users show increased differentiation between hands and tools in OTC \n  \nTo calculate group differences between activation patterns for hands and tools in OTC, we first computed the representational dissimilarity distances comparing each of the video conditions to every other video condition (for the RDMs for each group, see   A  ). While participants viewed multiple video conditions for each of the three effector categories, we focused on the representational distances between effector representations, across the multiple conditions. To do this, we averaged the cross-effector category representational dissimilarity distances for each participant. This resulted in three distances per participant, one for each cross-effector category pair (hands \u2194 litter pickers, hands \u2194 tongs, litter pickers \u2194 tongs). We entered these distances into a mixed level ANOVA: within-subject factors included the three cross-effector category distances and ROI (left OTC, right OTC), with a between-subject factor of group (experts, novices). This analysis revealed a significant two-way interaction between the effector category distances and group (  F   = 17.495,   p   < 0.001; BF  = 72.313; the three-way interaction between ROI, effector category distances and group was not significant:   F   = 1.267,   p   = 0.309; BF  = 1.088;   B  ). This suggests that there are group differences in the representational structure (full statistical report can be accessed at  ). Specifically, expert tool users represented the expert tool less like hands, i.e., experts showed increased dissimilarity distances between the expert tool (litter picker) and hands, compared with the novices (  t   = \u22123.385,   p   = 0.004, two-tailed; BF  = 11). Thus, the extensive tool use of the experts leads to the visual representation of the tool to become more dissimilar to hands (not more similar). Moreover, this shift was also observed for the non-expert tool (tongs) with experts representing the tongs less like hands, i.e., experts showed increased dissimilarity distances between tongs and hands, compared with novices (  t   = \u22122.574,   p   = 0.020, two-tailed; BF  = 3.1). Additionally, the two grasping tools (litter pickers \u2194 tongs) were represented equally similar to each other, i.e., no significant group differences in dissimilarity distances between the litter picker and tongs (  t   = 1.202,   p   = 0.246, two-tailed; BF  = 0.6). \n  \nExpert tool users represent tools less like hands.    A   , Group RDMs showing the pairwise distances (cross-validated Mahalanobis distance) between each video condition. Each element in the matrix was averaged across left and right OTC. Warmer colors indicate the conditions that evoked more dissimilar patterns of activity. Group multidimensional scaling plots derived from these group RDMs can be accessed at  .    B   , Bar plot of individual participants for each cross-effector category distance pair: hands \u2194 litter pickers, hands \u2194 tongs, and litter pickers \u2194 tongs. These values are generated by averaging the 8 \u00d7 8 pairwise comparison values, for each effector category pair, for each subject individually. Dark gray values reflect expert tool users (  n   = 7). Light gray values reflect novices (  n   = 12). Circles depict individual subject means. Values indicate group means \u00b1 standard error. Asterisks denote significance as follows; *  p   < 0.05, ***  p   < 0.005. \n  \nConsidering the small sample size of the expert litter pickers group, we next sought to test whether the observed effect in the experts could be replicated in each individual expert litter picker, as compared with the novice group. As such, one could consider each expert litter picker to be a case study and an independent replication of the effect. To test this, we used   method (a modified   t   test) to test whether each expert litter pickers' hands \u2194 litter pickers distance was significantly different from the novices ( ). This analysis revealed that five of seven expert litter pickers showed significantly greater hands \u2194 litter pickers distances (normalized by the litter pickers \u2194 tongs distance), as compared with the novices (two-tailed; range of   p   values for the five experts with significant tests: 0.002 <   p   < 0.022;   p   values for the two experts with non-significant tests: 0.144 and 0.245). This analysis further confirms that expert litter pickers show increased neural differentiation between visual representations of hands and tools within OTC. \n\nTo understand whether the group differences in effector category distances observed in OTC are driven by differences in the low-level representational structure (e.g., potential differences in eye movements between experts and novices), we repeated the group analysis within a second ROI, V1, as a control (  A  ) This analysis revealed no significant group differences in effector category distances within V1 (  F   = 0.013,   p   = 0.987; BF  = 0.330;   B  ). However, qualitatively, we observed a trend for a main effect of group (  F   = 2.662,   p   = 0.121; BF  = 0.592) with greater distances in the experts (full statistical report can be accessed at  ). Despite not being significant, to highlight that the group differences within OTC are not driven by greater distances in the experts' low-level representational structure captured within V1, we included the average effector category distance in V1 for each participant as a covariate in the OTC analysis. Even when controlling for this low-level representational structure, we still find significant group differences in effector category distances in OTC (significant interaction between effector category distances \u00d7 group:   F   = 11.982,   p   = 0.001; BF  = 61.216; full statistical report can be accessed at  ). \n  \nAnalyses in visual cortex and left parietal cortex.    A   , A V1 ROI probability map was constructed for all participants (  n   = 19). Warmer colors represent voxels that were included in a greater number of individual ROIs.    B   , Group RDMs for V1 showing the pairwise distances (cross-validated Mahalanobis distance) between each video condition. Warmer colors indicate the conditions that evoked more dissimilar patterns of activity.    C   , A left parietal cortex ROI probability map for all participants (  n   = 19) showing hand and tool selective voxels was defined using independent functional data. ROIs from all participants were superimposed. Warmer colors represent voxels that were included in a greater number of individual ROIs.    D   , Group RDMs for left parietal cortex showing the pairwise distances (cross-validated Mahalanobis distance) between each video condition. Warmer colors indicate the conditions that evoked more dissimilar patterns of activity. \n  \nFinally, we considered whether a neural embodiment result (i.e., tools becoming more similar to hands with extensive use) might be observed depending on the laterality of the presented stimuli (left-handed or right-handed), especially considering the experts reported only using the litter picker with their right hand. To test this, the previous RSA approach was repeated in OTC, except this time the video conditions were grouped by their laterality: left-handed or right-handed, i.e., averaged across other video conditions (group laterality RDMs available at  ). Nonetheless, we did not observe a significant three-way interaction with the laterality of the stimuli, group and effector category distances (  F   = 0.043,   p   = 0.958; BF  = 0.039), suggesting that the greater distances between hands and tools in the experts is not specific to the way in which the tool is visually experienced in the real world. \n\n\n### Investigating tool embodiment beyond OTC \n  \nWhile our experiment was specifically designed to leverage the known hand-tool representational relationship of OTC, our video stimuli also activated other regions relating to motor control and planning, providing us the opportunity to perform further exploratory analyses beyond OTC. To test whether a tool embodiment result would potentially be observed within neural structures involved more directly in motor planning for tool use, an exploratory analysis was performed in left parietal cortex (  B  ). This analysis revealed significant group differences in effector category distances (interaction between group \u00d7 effector category distances:   F   = 5.058,   p   = 0.020; BF  = 1.139;   D  ), similar to the interaction reported for OTC. However, the group comparisons between each individual effector category distance pair did not reach significance (hand \u2194 litter picker:   t   = \u20130.602,   p   = 0.555, two-tailed; BF  = 0.4; hand \u2194 tongs:   t   = 0.440,   p   = 0.116, two-tailed; BF  = 1; litter picker \u2194 tongs:   t   = \u20130.824,   p   = 0.421, two-tailed; BF  = 0.5). Although, on average, experts showed greater distances between hands and litter pickers and hand and tongs compared with novices, similar to what we see within OTC. To verify there is no evidence supporting a neural embodiment result within parietal cortex that contradicts the result within OTC, a one-tailed Bayesian   t   test provided substantial evidence in support of the null hypothesis (BF  = 0.2), i.e., that on average experts do not visually represent an expert tool more similar to hands compared with the novices. Together, while the findings in parietal cortex are weaker than OTC, they are suggestive of a similar pattern and do not provide any evidence supporting tool embodiment. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, a fMRI brain decoding technique was used to investigate how similar the representation of a hand is compared with an extensively used tool. This approach allowed us to directly compare hand and tool representations (independent of each other). Contrary to the tool embodiment theory, our findings show that expert tool users do not represent their own tool more similarly to a hand. Instead, experts showed greater dissimilarity distances between visual representations of hands and tools in OTC. Further, using   method, we independently replicated this effect in five of seven individual expert litter pickers, as compared with the novices. Additionally, these group differences were not driven by potential differences in the low-level representation structure, as captured within V1. Despite the experts reporting only using the litter picker with their right hand, we did not find that the group difference in dissimilarity distances between hands and the expert tool was specific to whether the expert tool was viewed as left-handed or right-handed. Additionally, experts showed greater dissimilarity between hands and the non-expert tool (tongs), suggesting that experts have a more distinct representation of general grasping tools. While we did not have clear hypothesis relating to other sensorimotor areas more directly involved in motor planning and control, the exploratory analysis conducted in left parietal cortex provided no evidence supporting a neural embodiment result. Together, our findings in expert tool users provide contradicting evidence to the tool embodiment theory. \n\nThere are several potential explanations for the current findings, specifically for how experience with tools leads to a differentiation between hand and tool representations. A primary explanation for the present result is the extensive visual tool experience of the experts. Both short-term ( ;  ;  ;  ) and long-term ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) visual experience have been shown to shape representations in visual cortex (for review, see  ;  ). For example, visual training with a category of novel visual objects leads to a differentiation of that category from similar untrained categories ( ). Similarly, extensive experience with specific orthographies leads to a distinct representation of those orthographies compared with other orthographies ( ). This is consistent with our recent work demonstrating that prosthesis usage in amputees leads to greater dissociation of prostheses relative to hands (and tools;  ). \n\nAlso, while we presume it is the tool representation that has changed in the experts, perhaps it is the representation of the tool action that has changed. Recent work has highlighted the role of OTC in processing observed actions ( ). This would explain why experts show greater dissimilarity between hands and both their expert tool (litter picker) and a similar grasping tool on which they did not have prior expertise (tongs). Alternatively, the observed effect for the non-expert tool relative to hands could potentially be driven simply by the shared visual features between the expert and non-expert tools. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated evidence for both of these predictions that OTC encodes information related to stimuli shape ( ;  ), as well as the functional/semantic properties of the stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nA second interpretation of the present findings stems from the motor literature which suggests that perhaps the visual hand representation has changed in the experts. Multiple studies have shown that the organizational structure of the sensorimotor hand representation is shaped by the natural statistics of hand usage ( ). Considering the intrinsic functional connectivity between the visual hand area and the sensorimotor hand representation ( ) and that the expert tool users extensively use their hands to interact with tools, perhaps, the representational shift shown in the experts is driven exclusively by changes in the visual hand representation. This would also explain why the distances relative to both tools changes. \n\nA third interpretation is that the mechanism supporting the increased differentiation of tools from hands observed in experts could be not strictly visual or motor, but rather driven by a larger cognitive mechanism. For instance, in the memory domain, the strengthening of representations is associated with pattern separation, thereby making a new representation less confusable with other memories ( ). Thus, in the present study, for experts to optimally control a hand or tool, the network differentiates these representations, to reduce potential interference and most successfully store and access information. \n\nIt is important to note that our experimental design may have several potential limitations. First, while viewing first-person videos during fMRI scans engages visuomotor regions, it did not activate sensorimotor regions (e.g., M1/S1). Considering sensorimotor cortex is more directly involved in the sensory and motor bodily experience, the computations within these neural structures could potentially be different from the pattern observed in OTC and parietal cortex. Unfortunately, the fMRI environment poses unique challenges for active experimental designs involving tool use, and as highlighted above, the actual sensorimotor engagement with the tool provides further confounds that we were eager to avoid. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that if subjects were actively involved in tool use during fMRI scans, a different representational structure could have been observed within these regions. Also, it is possible that while watching the videos, experts are mentally simulating actions differently to the novices. In this instance, novice behavior could be more varied in mentally simulating the actions. Previous research is inconclusive on the engagement of OTC during visual and motor imagery ( ;  ). It is also challenging, and perhaps counter-productive, to disentangle cognitive contribution to expert motor learning ( ). Nonetheless, future work is needed to determine whether the motor system produces different representational solutions to those observed here, to support expert tool use, both within and beyond the framework of embodiment. \n\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge the potential limitations of the small sample size used in the present study. Despite our greatest efforts to recruit more litter-picker experts (we originally interviewed 52 candidates for the study), we were only able to secure seven participants. Small sample sizes are known to lead to an overestimation of the actual effect size ( ), and a greater uncertainty around the estimate of the true effect size. Designs with a small sample size are also more susceptible to type II errors. Another problem, related to small sample sizes, is that the distribution of the sample is more likely to deviate from normality, and the limited sample size makes it often impossible to rigorously test the assumption of normality ( ). While we have attempted to account for some of these issues (e.g., by reporting the Bayes factors of the key findings), it is important to place our findings in this limiting context. Where sample size is inherently limited, the advice is to result to replications of the findings ( ). As such, here, we used case-study statistics to provide independent replications of our key effect, i.e., greater distances between hands and litter pickers in the experts relative to the novices. Nevertheless, other evidence presented here, and in particular the exploratory analysis in parietal cortex, awaits further confirmation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the exact nature for how experience modifies the representational structure is not yet fully understood, the current study offers a striking proof-of-concept for the adult human brain's ability for adaptive plasticity, advancing our current understanding of how categorical selectivity emerges within high level visual cortex. Our findings provide strong evidence that extensive tool use leads to an increased neural differentiation between visual representations of hands and tools. This evidence provides an important alternative framework to the embodiment theory. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8018880, "text_md5": "a591974f99b4c1b4bfc7a9000af60380", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 81], "journal": [82, 92], "publication_year": [94, 98], "title": [109, 207], "keywords": [221, 275], "abstract": [288, 2684], "body": [2693, 48053]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33563728, "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2489-20.2020", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018880", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8018880"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018880\">8018880</a>", "list_title": "PMC8018880  Expert Tool Users Show Increased Differentiation between Visual Representations of Hands and Tools"}

We demonstrate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods across a variety of Hi-C library preparations and input assembly sizes. The Python and C++ code for our method is openly available at  . \n   Author summary  \nHi-C technology was originally proposed to study the 3D organization of a genome. Recently, it has also been applied to assemble large eukaryotic genomes into chromosome-scale scaffolds. Despite this, there are few open source methods to generate these assemblies. Existing methods are also prone to small inversion errors due to noise in the Hi-C data. In this work, we address these challenges and develop a method, named SALSA2. SALSA2 uses sequence overlap information from an assembly graph to correct inversion errors and provide accurate chromosome-scale assemblies. \n \n\n# Body\n  \nThis is a   PLOS Computational Biology   Methods paper. \n \n## Introduction \n  \nGenome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genome sequence from significantly shorter sequencing reads. Most genome projects rely on whole genome shotgun sequencing which yields an oversampling of each genomic locus. Reads originating from the same locus are identified using assembly software, which can use these overlaps to reconstruct the genome sequence [ ,  ]. Most approaches are based on either a de Bruijn [ ] or a string graph [ ] formulation. Repetitive sequences exceeding the sequencing read length [ ] introduce ambiguity and prevent complete reconstruction. Unambiguous reconstructions of the sequence are output as \u201cunitigs\u201d (or often \u201ccontigs\u201d). Ambiguous reconstructions are output as edges linking unitigs. Scaffolding utilizes long-range linking information such as BAC or fosmid clones [ ,  ], optical maps [ \u2013 ], linked reads [ \u2013 ], or chromosomal conformation capture [ ] to order and orient contigs. If the linking information spans large distances on the chromosome, the resulting scaffolds can span entire chromosomes or chromosome arms. \n\nHi-C is a sequencing-based assay originally designed to interrogate the 3D structure of the genome inside a cell nucleus by measuring the contact frequency between all pairs of loci in the genome [ ]. The contact frequency between a pair of loci strongly correlates with the one-dimensional distance between them. Hi-C data can provide linkage information across a variety of length scales, spanning tens of megabases. As a result, Hi-C data can be used for genome scaffolding. Shortly after its introduction, Hi-C was used to generate chromosome-scale scaffolds [ \u2013 ]. \n\nLACHESIS [ ] is an early method for Hi-C scaffolding that first clusters contigs into a user-specified number of chromosome groups and then orients and orders the contigs in each group independently to generate scaffolds. Thus, the scaffolds inherit any assembly errors present in the contigs. The original SALSA1 [ ] method first corrects the input assembly, using a lack of Hi-C coverage as evidence of error. It then orients and orders the corrected contigs to generate scaffolds. Recently, the 3D-DNA [ ] method was introduced and demonstrated on a draft assembly of the   Aedes aegypti   genome. 3D-DNA also corrects the errors in the input assembly and then iteratively orients and orders contigs into a single megascaffold. This megascaffold is then broken, identifying chromosomal ends based on the Hi-C contact map. \n\nThere are several shortcomings common across currently available tools. They are sensitive to input assembly contiguity and Hi-C library variations and require tuning of parameters for each dataset. Inversions are common when the input contigs are short, as orientation is determined by maximizing the interaction frequency between contig ends across all possible orientations [ ]. When contigs are long, there are few interactions spanning the full length of the contigs, making the true orientation apparent from the higher weight of links. However, in the case of short contigs, there are interactions spanning the full length of the contig, making the true orientation have a similar weight to incorrect orientations. Biological factors, such as topologically associated domains (TADs), also confound this analysis [ ]. \n\nSALSA1 [ ] addressed some of these challenges, such as not requiring the expected number of chromosomes beforehand and correcting assemblies before scaffolding them with Hi-C data. We showed that SALSA1 worked better than the most widely used method, LACHESIS [ ]. However, SALSA1 often did not generate chromosome-sized scaffolds. The contiguity and correctness of the scaffolds depended on the coverage of Hi-C data and required manual data-dependent parameter tuning. Building on this work, SALSA2 does not require manual parameter tuning and is able to utilize all the contact information from the Hi-C data to generate near optimal sized scaffolds permitted by the data using a novel iterative scaffolding method. In addition to this, SALSA2 enables the use of an assembly graph to guide scaffolding, thereby minimizing errors, particularly orientation errors. \n\nSALSA2 is an open source software that combines Hi-C linkage information with the ambiguous-edge information from a genome assembly graph to better resolve contig orientations. We propose a novel stopping condition, which does not require an   a priori   estimate of chromosome count, as it naturally stops when the Hi-C information is exhausted. We show that SALSA2 produces fewer orientation, ordering, and chimeric errors across a wide range of assembly contiguities. We also demonstrate its robustness to different Hi-C libraries with varying levels of intra-chromosomal contact frequencies. When compared to 3D-DNA, SALSA2 generates more accurate scaffolds across most conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first method to leverage assembly graph information for scaffolding Hi-C data. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n shows the overview of the SALSA2 pipeline. SALSA2 begins with a draft assembly generated from long reads such as Pacific Biosciences [ ] or Oxford Nanopore [ ]. SALSA2 requires the contig sequences and, optionally, a GFA-formatted assembly graph [ ] representing the ambiguous reconstructions. Hi-C reads are aligned to the contig sequences, and contigs are optionally split in regions lacking Hi-C coverage. A hybrid scaffold graph is constructed using both ambiguous edges from the GFA and edges from the Hi-C reads, scoring edges according to a \u201cbest buddy\u201d scheme. Scaffolds are iteratively constructed from this graph using a greedy weighted maximum matching. A mis-join detection step is performed after each iteration to check if any of the joins made during this round are incorrect. Incorrect joins are broken and the edges blacklisted during subsequent iterations. This process continues until the majority of joins made in the prior iteration are incorrect. This provides a natural stopping condition, when accurate Hi-C links have been exhausted. Below, we describe each of the steps in detail. \n  \n(A) Overview of the SALSA2 scaffolding algorithm. (B) Linkage information obtained from the alignment of Hi-C reads to the assembly. Arrows denote contigs and arcs between arrows denote the inferred linking information from Hi-C reads. Thickness of arcs denote the weight on the Hi-C edge. Thicker edge indicates higher edge weight implied by Hi-C reads (C) Assembly graph obtained from the assembler, where arrows are contigs and arcs denote overlap between contigs(D) Hybrid scaffold graph constructed from the links obtained from the Hi-C read alignments and the overlap graph. Solid edges indicate the linkages between different contigs and dotted edges indicate the links between the ends of the same contig. B and E denote the start and end of contigs, respectively. The E-E edge between blue and red contigs is dashed as this particular orientation between them is not supported by assembly graph, but rather B-E edge is supported. We ignore this dotted edge while computing maximal matching (E) Maximal weighted matching obtained from the graph using a greedy weighted maximum matching algorithm. The numbering of the edges indicates the order in which they were added to the graph. No more solid edges can be added to the matching as it would assign more than one edge to already matched nodes. (F) Edges between the ends of same contigs are added back to the matching to obtain final scaffolds. \n  \n### Hi-C library preparation \n  \nHi-C methods first crosslink a sample (cells or tissues) to preserve the genome conformation. The crosslinked DNA is then digested using multiple restriction enzymes (targeting in this case the restriction sites GATC and GANTC). The single-stranded 5\u2019-overhangs are then filled in causing digested ends to be labeled with a biotinylated nucleotide. Next, spatially proximal digested ends of DNA are ligated, preserving both short- and long-range DNA contiguity. The DNA is then purified and sheared to a size appropriate for Illumina short-read sequencing. After shearing, the biotinylated fragments are enriched to assure that only fragments originating from ligation events are sequenced in paired-end mode via Illumina sequencers to inform DNA contiguity. \n\n\n### Read alignment \n  \nHi-C paired end reads are aligned to contigs using the BWA aligner [ ](parameters: -t 12 -B 8) as single end reads. First, the reads mapping at multiple locations are ignored as they can cause ambiguities while scaffolding. Reads which align across ligation junctions are chimeric and are trimmed to retain only the start of the read which aligns prior to the ligation junction. After filtering the chimeric reads, the pairing information is restored. Any PCR duplicates in the paired-end alignments are removed using Picard tools [ ]. Read pairs aligned to different contigs are used to construct the initial scaffold graph. The suggested mapping pipeline is available at  . \n\n\n### Contig correction \n  \nAs any assembly is likely to contain mis-assembled sequences, SALSA2 uses the physical coverage of Hi-C pairs to identify suspicious regions and break the sequence at the likely point of mis-assembly. We define the physical coverage of a Hi-C read pair as the region on the contig spanned by the start of the leftmost fragment and the end of the rightmost fragment. A drop in physical coverage indicates a likely assembly error. In SALSA1, contigs are split when a fixed minimum coverage threshold is not met. A drawback of this approach is that coverage can vary, both due to sequencing depth and variation in Hi-C link density. \n\n sketches the new contig correction algorithm implemented in SALSA2. Instead of the single coverage threshold used in SALSA1, a set of suspicious intervals is found with a sweep of thresholds. For a sweep of thresholds, we find the continuous stretches of regions which have lower physical coverage. Note that there can be multiple intervals for a particular threshold that have multiple stretches of low coverage. In such case, we only consider the interval of the maximum size. These intervals denote the regions of potential misassembly on the contig. Using the collection of these intervals as an interval graph, we find the maximal clique, which is the maximal set of intervals intersecting at any location along the contig. This maximal clique represents the region of the contig which had low coverage for the majority of the tested cutoffs. This can be done in   O  (  NlogN  ) time, where   N   is the number of intervals. For a maximal clique, the region between the start and end of the smallest interval in the clique is flagged as a mis-assembly and the contig is split into three pieces\u2014the sequence to the left of the region, the junction region itself, and the sequence to the right of the region. The intuition behind choosing the smallest interval is to accurately pinpoint the location of assembly error. Note that this algorithm finds only one misassembly per contig. For more rigorous misassembly detection, same algorithm can be run multiple times on each contig until no more drops in physical coverage are found. \n   Example of the mis-assembly detection algorithm in SALSA2.  \nThe plot shows the position on x-axis and the physical coverage on the y-axis. The dotted horizontal lines show the different thresholds tested to find low physical coverage intervals. The lines at the bottom show the suspicious intervals identified by the algorithm. The dotted line through the intervals shows the maximal clique. The smallest interval (purple) in the clique is identified as mis-assembly and the contig is broken in three parts at its boundaries. \n  \n\n### Assembly graph construction \n  \nFor our experiments, we use the unitig assembly graph produced by Canu [ ] ( ), as this is a more conservative assembly output than contig sequences that represent various traversals of this graph. SALSA2 requires only a GFA format [ ] representation of the assembly. Since most long-read genome assemblers such as FALCON [ ], miniasm [ ], Canu [ ], and Flye [ ] provide assembly graphs in GFA format, their output is compatible with SALSA2 for scaffolding. \n\n\n### Scaffold graph construction \n  \nThe scaffold graph is defined as   G  (  V  ,   E  ), where nodes   V   are the ends of contigs and edges   E   are derived from the Hi-C read mapping ( ). The idea of using contig ends as nodes is similar to that used by the string graph formulation [ ]. \n\nModeling each contigs as two nodes allows a pair of contigs to have multiple edges in any of the four possible orientations (forward-forward, forward-reverse, reverse-forward, and reverse-reverse). The graph then contains two edge types\u2014one explicitly connects two different contigs based on Hi-C data, while the other implicitly connects the two ends of the same contig. \n\nAs in SALSA1, we normalize the Hi-C read counts by the frequency of restriction enzyme cut sites in each contig. This normalization reduces the bias in the number of shared read pairs due to the contig length as the number of Hi-C reads sequenced from a particular region are proportional to the number of restriction enzyme cut sites in that region. For each contig, we denote the number of times a cut site appears as   C  (  V  ). We define edges weights of   G   as:\n \nwhere   N  (  u  ,   v  ) is the number of Hi-C read pairs mapped to the ends of the contigs   u   and   v  . By the ends, we mean the first and second half of the contig if divided at the midpoint along its length. \n\nWe observed that the globally highest edge weight does not always capture the correct orientation and ordering information due to variations in Hi-C interaction frequencies within a genome. To address this, we defined a modified edge ratio, similar to the one described in [ ], which captures the relative weights of all the neighboring edges for a particular node. \n\nThe best buddy weight   BB  (  u  ,   v  ) is the weight   W  (  u  ,   v  ) divided by the maximal weight of any edge incident upon nodes   u   or   v  , excluding the (  u  ,   v  ) edge itself. Computing best buddy weight naively would take   O  (|  E  | ) time. This is computationally prohibitive since the graph,   G  , is usually dense. If the maximum weighted edge incident on each node is stored with the node, the running time for the computation becomes   O  (|  E  |). We retain only edges where   BB  (  u  ,   v  ) > 1. This keeps only the edges that are the best incident edge on both   u   and   v  . Once used, the edges are removed from subsequent iterations. Thus, the most confident edges are used first but initially low-scoring edges can become best in subsequent iterations. \n\nFor the assembly graph, we define a similar ratio. Since the edge weights are optional in the GFA specification and do not directly relate to the proximity of two contigs on the chromosome, we use the graph topology to establish this relationship. Let   denote the reverse complement of the contig   u  . Let   \u03c3  (  u  ,   v  ) denote the length of shortest path between   u   and   v  . For each edge (  u  ,   v  ) in the scaffold graph, we find the shortest path between contigs   u   and   v   in every possible orientation, that is,   \u03c3  (  u  ,   v  ),  ,   and  . With this, the score for a pair of contigs is defined as follows:\n \nwhere   x   and   y   are the orientations in which   u   and   v   are connected by a shortest path in the assembly graph. Essentially,   Score  (  u  ,   v  ) is the ratio of the length of the second shortest path to the length of the shortest path in all possible orientations. Once again, we retain edges where   Score  (  u  ,   v  ) > 1. If the orientation implied by the assembly graph differs from the orientation implied by the Hi-C data, we remove the Hi-C edge and retain the assembly graph edge ( ). Computing the score graph requires |  E  | shortest path queries, yielding total runtime of   O  (|  E  |*(|  V  | + |  E  |)) since we do not use the edge weights. \n\n\n### Contig layout \n  \nOnce we have the hybrid graph, we lay out the contigs to generate scaffolds. Since there are implicit edges in the graph   G   between the beginning and end of each contig, the problem of computing a scaffold layout can be modeled as finding a weighted maximum matching in a general graph, with edge weights being our ratio weights. In a weighted maximum matching, a set of edges from a graph is chosen in such a way that they have no endpoints common and the sum of edge weights is maximized. In the case of scaffolding, a maximum weighted matching implies a layout of contigs, where no end can be used twice, that is maximally consistent with the data being used for scaffolding (Hi-C in our case). If we find the weighted maximum matching of the non-implicit edges (that is, edges between different contigs) in the graph, adding the implicit edges to this matching would yield a complete traversal. However, adding implicit edges to the matching can introduce a cycle. Such cycles are prevented by removing the lowest-weight non-implicit edge. Computing a maximal matching takes   O  (|  E  ||  V  | ) time [ ]. We iteratively find a maximum matching in the graph by removing nodes found in the previous iteration. Using the optimal maximum matching algorithm this would take   O  (|  E  ||  V  | ) time, which would be extremely slow for large graphs. Instead, we use a greedy maximal matching algorithm which is guaranteed to find a matching within 1/2-approximation of the optimum [ ]. The greedy matching algorithm takes   O  (|  E  |) time, thereby making the total runtime   O  (|  V  ||  E  |). The algorithm for contig layout is sketched in Algorithm 1.   show the layout on an example graph. Contigs which were not scaffolded are inserted in the large scaffolds with the method used in SALSA1. If unitigs are used as an input and the layout of unitigs along contigs is provided as an input to SALSA2, it can replace unitig sequences by contigs in the final scaffolds. \n\n Algorithm 1   Contig Layout Algorithm \n\n E  : Edges sorted by the best buddy weight \n\n M  : Set to store maximal matchings \n\n G  : The scaffold graph \n\n while   all nodes in   G   are not matched   do  \n\n\u2003  M  * = {} \n\n\u2003  for   e   \u2208   E   sorted by best buddy weights   do  \n\n\u2003\u2003  if   e   can be added to   M  *   then  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003  M  * =   M  * \u222a   e  \n\n\u2003\u2003  end if  \n\n\u2003  end for  \n\n\u2003  M   =   M   \u222a   M  * \n\n\u2003Remove nodes and edges which are part of   M  * from G \n\n end while  \n\n\n### Iterative mis-join correction \n  \nSince the contig layout is greedy, it can introduce errors by selecting a false Hi-C link which was not eliminated by our ratio scoring. These errors propagate downstream, causing large chimeric scaffolds and chromosomal fusions. We examine each join made within all the scaffolds in the last iteration for correctness. Any join with low spanning Hi-C support relative to the rest of the scaffold is broken and the links are blacklisted for further iterations. \n\nWe compute the physical coverage spanned by all read pairs aligned in a window of size   w   around each join. For each window,   w  , we create an auxiliary array, which stores \u22121 at position   i   if the physical coverage is greater than some cutoff   \u03b4   and 1, otherwise. We then find the maximum sum subarray in this auxiliary array, since it captures the longest stretch of low physical coverage. If the position being tested for a mis-join lies within the region spanned by the maximal clique generated with the maximum sum subarray intervals for different cutoffs ( ), the join is marked as incorrect. The physical coverage can be computed in   O  (  w   +   N  ) time, where   N   is the number of read pairs aligned in window   w  . The maximum sum subarray computation takes   O  (  w  ) time. If   K   is the number of cutoffs(  \u03b4  ) tested for the suspicious join finding, then the total runtime of mis-assembly detection becomes   O  (  K  (  N   + 2*  w  )). The parameter   K   controls the specificity of the mis-assembly detection, thereby avoiding false positives. The algorithm for mis-join detection is sketched in Algorithm 2. When the majority of joins made in a particular iteration are flagged as incorrect by the algorithm, SASLA2 stops scaffolding and reports the scaffolds generated in the penultimate iteration as the final result. \n\n Algorithm 2   Misjoin detection and correction algorithm \n\n Cov  : Physical coverage array for a window size   w   around a scaffold join at position   p   on a scaffold \n\n A  : Auxiliary array \n\n I  : Maximum sum subarray intervals \n\n for   \u03b4   \u2208 {min_coverage, max_coverage}   do  \n\n\u2003  if   Cov  [  i  ] \u2264   \u03b4   then  \n\n\u2003\u2003  A  [  i  ] = 1 \n\n\u2003  else  \n\n\u2003\u2003  A  [  i  ] = \u22121 \n\n\u2003  end if  \n\n\u2003  s  ,   e   = maximum_sum_subarray(  A  ) \n\n\u2003  I   =   I  \u222a{  s  ,   e  } \n\n end for  \n\n s  ,   e   = maximal_clique_interval(  I  ) \n\n if   p   \u2208 {  s  ,   e  }   then  \n\n\u2003Break the scaffold at position   p  \n\n end if  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Dataset description \n  \nWe created artificial assemblies, each containing contigs of same size, by splitting the GRCh38 [ ] reference into fixed-sized contigs of 200 to 900 kbp. This gave us eight assemblies. The assembly graph for each input was built by adding edges for any adjacent contigs in the genome. So the simulated assembly graph was linear with edges between two adjacent contigs for each contig in the graph. \n\nFor real data, we use the recently published NA12878 human dataset sequenced with Oxford Nanopore [ ] and assembled with Canu [ ]. We use a Hi-C library from Arima Genomics (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA) sequenced to 40x Illumina coverage (SRX3651893).   shows the statistics for this library. We compare results with the original SALSA(commit\u2014833fb11), SALSA2 with and without the assembly graph input(commit\u201468a65b4), and 3D-DNA (commit\u20143f18163). We did not compare our results with LACHESIS because it is no longer supported and is outperformed by 3D-DNA [ ]. SALSA2 was run using default parameters, with the exception of graph incorporation, as listed. For 3D-DNA, alignments were generated using the Juicer alignment pipeline [ ] with defaults (-m haploid -t 15000 -s 2), except for mis-assembly detection, as listed. A genome size of 3.2 Gbp was used for contiguity statistics for all assemblies. \n   Hi-C library statistics for different datasets used in this paper.  \nMapped read pairs denote the total number of Hi-C read pairs aligned before mapping quality filtering. Intra-contig read pairs account for the read pairs where both the reads align to same contig and inter-contig read pairs account for the read pairs where both reads align to different contigs. \n    \nFor evaluation, we also used the GRCh38 reference to define a set of true and false links from the Hi-C graph. We mapped the assembly to the reference with MUMmer3.23 (nucmer -c 500 -l 20) [ ] and generated a tiling using MUMmer\u2019s show-tiling utility. For this \u201ctrue link\u201d dataset, any link joining contigs in the same chromosome in the correct orientation was marked as true. This also gave the true contig position, orientation, and chromosome assignment. We masked sequences in GRCh38 that matched known structural variants from a previous assembly of NA12878 [ ] to avoid counting true variations as scaffolding errors. \n\n\n### Evaluation on simulated contigs \n  \n#### Assembly correction \n  \nWe simulated assembly error by randomly joining 200 pairs of contigs from each simulated assembly. All erroneous joins were made between contigs that were more than 10 Mbp apart or were assigned to different chromosomes in the reference. The remaining contigs were unaltered. We then aligned the Arima-HiC data and ran our assembly correction algorithm. When the algorithm marked a mis-join within 20 kbp of a true error we called it a true positive, otherwise we called it a false positive. Any unmarked error was called a false negative. The average sensitivity over all simulated assemblies was 77.62% and the specificity was 86.13%. The sensitivity was highest for larger contigs (50% for 200 kbp versus more than 90% for contigs greater than 500 kbp,  ) implying that our algorithm is able to accurately identify errors in large contigs, which can have a negative impact on the final scaffolds if not corrected. Although we used a cutoff of 20 kbp to evaluate sensitivity and specificity, most of the predicted locations of misassembly were within 5 kbp from the true misassembly location ( ). \n\n\n#### Scaffold mis-join validation \n  \nAs before, we simulated erroneous scaffolds by joining contigs which were not within 10 Mbp in the reference or were assigned to different chromosomes. Rather than pairs of contigs, each erroneous scaffold joined 10 contigs and we generated 200 such erroneous scaffolds. The remaining contigs were correctly scaffolded (ten contigs per scaffold) based on their location in the reference. The average sensitivity was 67.66% and specificity was 100% ( )(no correct scaffolds were broken). Most of the un-flagged joins occurred near the ends of scaffolds and could be captured by decreasing the window size. Similar to assembly correction, we observed that sensitivity was highest with larger input contigs. Most of the misjoins missed by the algorithm were near the ends of scaffolds. The issue in detecting mis-assemblies in these regions is the low Hi-C physical coverage. Also, the other missed joins were between the small contigs which are hard to capture with Hi-C data alone. This evaluation highlights the accuracy of the mis-join detection algorithm to avoid over-scaffolding and provide a suitable stopping condition. \n\n\n#### Scaffold accuracy \n  \nWe evaluated scaffolds across three categories of error: orientation, order, and chimera. An orientation error occurs whenever the orientation of a contig in a scaffold differs from that of the scaffold in the reference. An ordering error occurs when a set of three contigs adjacent in a scaffold have non-monotonic coordinates in the reference. A chimera error occurs when any pair of contigs adjacent in a scaffold align to different chromosomes in the reference. We broke the assembly at these errors and computed corrected scaffold lengths and NGA50 (analogous to the corrected NG50 metric defined by Salzberg et al. [ ]). This statistic corrects for large but erroneous scaffolds which have an artificially high NG50. We did not include SALSA1 in the comparison because for small contig sizes (200 kbp to 500 kbp), none of the scaffolds contained more than 2 contigs. For larger sizes (600 kbp to 900 kbp), the contiguity widely varied depending upon the minimum confidence parameter for accepting links between contigs. \n\nHi-C scaffolding errors, particularly orientation errors, increased with decreasing assembly contiguity. We evaluated scaffolding methods across a variety of simulated contig sizes.   shows the comparison of these errors for 3D-DNA, SALSA2 without the assembly graph, and SALSA2 with the graph. SALSA2 produced fewer errors than 3D-DNA across all error types and input sizes. The number of correctly oriented contigs increased significantly when assembly graph information was integrated with the scaffolding, particularly for lower input contig sizes ( ). For example, at 400 kbp, the orientation errors with the graph were comparable to the orientation errors of the graph-less approach at 900 kbp. The NGA50 for SALSA2 also increased when assembly graph information was included ( ). This highlights the power of the assembly graph to improve scaffolding and correct errors, especially on lower contiguity assemblies. This also indicates that generating a conservative assembly, rather than maximizing contiguity, can be preferable for input to Hi-C scaffolding. All the assemblies described in this paper are available online and can be found at  . \n   Comparison of orientation, ordering, and chimeric errors in the scaffolds produced by SALSA2 and 3D-DNA on the simulated data.  \nAs expected, the number of errors for all error types decrease with increasing input contig size. Incorporating the assembly graph reduces error across all categories and most assembly sizes, with the largest decrease seen in orientation errors. SALSA2 utilizing the graph has 2-4 fold fewer errors than 3D-DNA. \n     (A) NGA50 statistic for different input contig sizes and (B) the length of longest error-free block for different input contig sizes.  \nOnce again, the assembly graph typically increases both the NGA50 and the largest correct block. \n  \n\n\n### Evaluation on NA12878 \n  \n lists the metrics for NA12878 scaffolds. We include an idealized scenario, using only reference-filtered Hi-C edges for comparison. As expected, the scaffolds generated using only true links had the highest NGA50 value and longest error-free scaffold block. SALSA2 scaffolds were generally more accurate and contiguous than the scaffolds generated by SALSA1 and 3D-DNA, even without use of the assembly graph. The addition of the graph further improved the NGA50 and longest error-free scaffold length. \n   Scaffold and correctness statistics for NA12878 assemblies scaffolded with different Hi-C libraries.  \n\u201cTrue links\u201d is an idealized case where the Hi-C links have been filtered in advance. The NG50 of human reference GRCh38 is 145 Mbp. The ratio between NG50 and NGA50 represents how many erroneous joins affect large scaffolds in the assembly. The bigger the difference between these values, the more aggressive the scaffolding was at the expense of accuracy. Longest chunk represents the longest error-free portion of the scaffolds. We observed that the 3D-DNA mis-assembly detection was overly aggressive in some cases, and so we ran some assemblies both with and without this feature. For the Illumina assembly as an input, 3D-DNA w correction did not finish within two weeks and is omitted. An evaluation of a previously published [ ] 3D-DNA assembly from short-read contigs is included in   but did not exceed SALSA2\u2019s NGA50. \n    \nWe also evaluated the assemblies using Feature Response Curves (FRC) based on scaffolding errors [ ]. An assembly can have a high raw error count but still be of high quality if the errors are restricted to only short scaffolds. FRC captures this by showing how quickly error is accumulated, starting from the largest scaffolds.   shows the FRC for different assemblies, where the X-axis denotes the cumulative % of assembly errors and the Y-axis denotes the cumulative assembly size. The assemblies with more area under the curve accumulate fewer errors in larger scaffolds and hence are more accurate. SALSA2 scaffolds with and without the graph have similar areas under the curve and closely match the curve of the assembly using only true links. The 3D-DNA scaffolds have the lowest area under the curve, implying that most errors in the assembly occur in the long scaffolds. This is confirmed by the lower NGA50 value for the 3D-DNA assembly ( ). \n   Feature response curve for (A) assemblies obtained from contigs as input (B) assemblies obtained from mitotic Hi-C data and (C) assemblies obtained using Dovetail Chicago data.  \nThe best assemblies lie near the top left of the plot, with the largest area under the curve. \n  \nApart from the correctness, SALSA2 scaffolds were highly contiguous and reached an NG50 of 112.8 Mbp (cf. GRCh38 NG50 of 145 Mbp).   shows the alignment ideogram for the input contigs as well as the SALSA2 assembly. Every color change indicates an alignment break, either due to error or due to the end of a sequence. The input contigs are fragmented with multiple contigs aligning to the same chromosome, while the SALSA2 scaffolds are highly contiguous and span entire chromosomes in many cases.   shows the contiguity plot with corrected NG stats. As expected, the assembly generated with only true links has the highest values for all NGA stats. The curve for SALSA2 assemblies with and without the assembly graph closely matches this curve, implying that the scaffolds generated with SALSA2 are approaching the optimal assembly of this Arima-HiC data. \n   Chromosome ideogram generated using the coloredChromosomes [ ] package.  \nEach color switch denotes a change in the aligned sequence, either due to large structural error or the end of a contig/scaffold. Left: input contigs aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome. Right: SALSA2 scaffolds aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome. More than ten chromosomes are in a single scaffold. Chromosomes 16 and 19 are more fragmented due to scaffolding errors that break the alignment. \n     Contiguity plot for scaffolds generated with (A) standard Arima-HiC data (B) mitotic Hi-C data and (C) Chicago data.  \nThe X-axis denotes the NGAX statistic and the Y-axis denotes the corrected block length to reach the NGAX value. SALSA2 results were generated using the assembly graph, unless otherwise noted. \n  \nWe also evaluated the ability of scaffolding short-read assemblies for both 3D-DNA and SALSA2. We did not include SALSA1 in this comparison because it is not designed to scaffold short-read assemblies. We observed that use of the assembly graph when scaffolding significantly reduced the number of orientation errors for SALSA2, increasing the scaffold NGA50 and largest chunk almost two-fold. When compared to 3D-DNA without input assembly correction, SALSA2 with the assembly graph generates scaffolds of much higher NGA50 (7.99 Mbp vs. 1.00 Mbp). The number of scaffolding errors across all the categories was much lower in SALSA2 compared to 3D-DNA. \n\nWe computed the CPU runtime and memory usage for both the methods while scaffolding long and short read assemblies with Arima-HiC data. We excluded the time required to map reads in both cases. While scaffolding the long-read assembly SALSA2 was 30-fold faster and required 3-fold less memory than 3D-DNA (11.44 CPU hours and 21.43 Gb peak memory versus 3D-DNA with assembly correction at 318 CPU hours and 64.66 Gb peak memory). For the short-read assembly, the difference in runtime was even more pronounced. SALSA2 required 36.8 CPU hours and 61.8 Gb peak memory compared to 2980 CPU hours and 48.04 Gb peak memory needed by 3D-DNA without assembly correction. When run with assembly correction, 3D-DNA ran over 14 days on a 16-core machine without completing so we could not report any results. \n\n\n### Robustness to input library \n  \nWe next tested scaffolding using two libraries with different Hi-C contact patterns. The first, from [ ], is sequenced during mitosis. This removes the topological domains and generates fewer off-diagonal interactions. The other library was from [ ], are   in vitro   chromatin sequencing library (Chicago) generated by Dovetail Genomics (L1). It also removes off-diagonal matches but has shorter-range interactions, limited by the size of the input molecules. As seen from the contact map in  , both the mitotic Hi-C and Chicago libraries follow different interaction distributions than the standard Hi-C (Arima-HiC in this case).   shows the mapping statistics for these libraries. We ran SALSA2 with defaults and 3D-DNA with both the assembly correction turned on and off. \n   Contact map of Hi-C interactions on chromosome 3 generated by the Juicebox software [ ].  \nThe cells sequenced in (A) normal conditions, (B) during mitosis, and (C) Dovetail Chicago. \n  \nFor mitotic Hi-C data, we observed that the 3D-DNA mis-assembly correction algorithm sheared the input assembly into small pieces, which resulted in more than 25,000 errors and more than half of the contigs incorrectly oriented or ordered. Without mis-assembly correction, the 3D-DNA assembly has a higher number of orientation (250 vs. 81) and ordering (215 vs. 54) errors compared to SALSA2. The feature response curve for the 3D-DNA assembly with breaking is almost a diagonal ( ) because the sheared contigs appeared to be randomly joined. SALSA2 scaffolds contain longer stretches of correct scaffolds compared to 3D-DNA with and without mis-assembly correction ( ). SALSA1 scaffolds had a similar error count to SALSA2 but were less contiguous. \n\nFor the Chicago libraries, 3D-DNA without correction had the best NGA50 and largest correct chunk. However, the scaffolds had more chimeric join errors than SALSA2. SALSA2 outperformed 3D-DNA in terms of NG50, NGA50, and longest chunk when 3D-DNA was run with assembly correction. 3D-DNA uses signatures of chromosome ends [ ] to identify break positions which are not prominently present in Chicago data. As a result, it generated more chimeric joins compared to SALSA2. However, the number of order and orientation errors was similar across the methods. Since Chicago libraries do not provide chromosome-spanning contact information for scaffolding, the NG50 value for SALSA2 is 5.8 Mbp, comparable to the equivalent coverage assembly (50% L1+L2) in [ ] but much smaller than Hi-C libraries. Interestingly, SALSA1 was able to generate scaffolds of similar contiguity to SALSA2, which can be attributed to the lack of long range contact information in the library. SALSA2 is robust to changing contact distributions. In the case of Chicago data it produced a less contiguous assembly due to the shorter interaction distance. However, it avoids introducing false chromosome joins, unlike 3D-DNA, which appears tuned for a specific contact model. \n\n\n### Scaffolding non-model organisms \n  \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of SALSA2 on a non-model organism, we used Hi-C data from recently published   Anopheles funestus   genome assembly which was scaffolded using an independent method (Phase Genomics or LACHESIS [ ]) and manually curated using Illumina mate-pair support as well as FISH information [ ]. This genome had high heterozygosity as the data was sequenced from a colony of mosquitoes rather than a single individual. Due to this, the assembly had a high duplication rate and was almost double the expected genome size. We scaffolded both the full assembly and the assembly after running purge haplotigs [ ] using SALSA2 and 3D-DNA. For the post purge assembly, 3D-DNA generated an assembly with higher continuity but with more errors and a similar NA50 to SALSA2. ( ). However, neither method performed well for the full assembly. SALSA2 was more contiguous than 3D-DNA ( ) but was still very fragmented and much larger than the expected genome size. We conclude that heterozygous genome scaffolding remains a challenge and assemblies must either be de-duplicated beforehand or improved algorithms for scaffolding, such as [ ] are needed. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this work, we present the first Hi-C scaffolding method that integrates an assembly graph to produce high-accuracy, chromosome-scale assemblies. Our experiments on both simulated and real sequencing data for the human genome demonstrate the benefits of using an assembly graph to guide scaffolding. We also show that SALSA2 outperforms alternative Hi-C scaffolding tools on assemblies of varied contiguity, using multiple Hi-C library preparations. \n\nSALSA2\u2019s misassembly correction and scaffold misjoin validation can be improved in several ways. The current implementation does not detect a misjoin between two small contigs with high accuracy, mainly because Hi-C data does not have enough resolution to correct such errors. Also, we do not account for any GC bias correction when using the Hi-C coverage for detecting misjoins. Addressing these challenges in misjoin detection and misassembly correction is the immediate next step to improve the SALSA2 software. \n\nThe human genome is relatively homozygous compared to many other species. Assembly of many species is further complicated by DNA input requirements which necessitates pooling multiple individuals. SALSA2 does not remove duplication present in an input assembly and thus requires pre-processing by another tool, such as Purge Haplotigs [ ] or haplomerger [ ]. Once contigs are classified into the \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201chaplotig\u201d sets, SALSA2 could be run on each of the sets independently. \n\nHi-C scaffolding has been historically prone to inversion errors when the input assembly is highly fragmented. The integration of the assembly graph with the scaffolding process can overcome this limitation. Orientation errors introduced in the assembly and scaffolding process can lead to incorrect identification of structural variations. On simulated data, more than 50% of errors were due to inversions, and integrating the assembly graph reduced these by as much as 3 to 4 fold. We did not observe as much improvement with the NA12878 test dataset because the contig NG50 was much higher than in the simulation. However, it is not always possible to assemble multi-megabase contigs. In such cases, the assembly graph is useful for limiting Hi-C errors. \n\nMost existing Hi-C scaffolding methods also require an estimate for the number of chromosomes for a genome. This is implicitly taken to be the desired number of scaffolds to output. As demonstrated by the Chicago, mitotic, and replicate [ ] Hi-C libraries, the library as well as the genome influences the maximum correct scaffold size. It can be impractical to sweep over hundreds of chromosome values to select a \u201cbest\u201d assembly. Since SALSA2\u2019s mis-join correction algorithm stops scaffolding after the useful linking information in a dataset is exhausted, no chromosome count is needed as input. \n\nObtaining the chromosome-scale picture of the genome is important and there is a trade-off between accuracy and continuity of the assembly. However, we believe that manual curation to remove assembly errors is an expensive and involved process that can often outpace the cost of the rest of the project. Most of the assembly projects using Hi-C data have had a significant curation effort to date [ ,  ]. Thus, we believe that not introducing errors in the first place is a better strategy to avoid the later burden of manual curation of small errors in chromosomes. The Hi-C data can be used with other independent technologies, such as optical mapping or linked-reads to reach accurate chromosome-scale scaffolds. 3D-DNA was recently updated to not require the chromosome count as input but the algorithm used has not been described. Interestingly, it no longer generates single-chromosome scaffolds in our experiments, a major claim in [ ], supporting a conservative scaffolding approach. Even while scaffolding short-read assemblies, we observed that SALSA2 generated more accurate scaffolds than 3D-DNA, indicating the utility of SALSA2 in scaffolding existing short-read assemblies of different genomes with the newly generated Hi-C data. \n\nAs the Genome10K consortium [ ] and independent scientists begin to sequence novel lineages in the tree of life, it may be impractical to generate physical or genetics maps for every organism. Thus, Hi-C sequencing combined with SALSA2 presents an economical alternative for the reconstruction of chromosome-scale assemblies. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6719893, "text_md5": "ac4b84c0ddd2dd0e64b2617ccbbdf4fb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 148], "journal": [149, 165], "publication_year": [167, 171], "title": [182, 255], "keywords": [269, 269], "abstract": [282, 1744], "body": [1753, 44941]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31433799, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007273", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719893", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6719893"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719893\">6719893</a>", "list_title": "PMC6719893  Integrating Hi-C links with assembly graphs for chromosome-scale assembly"}

Mutations in this gene cause \u223c5% of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) worldwide, but are also associated with cone\u2013rod dystrophy (CRD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) phenotypes. Our purpose was to clinically characterize   RPGRIP1   patients from our cohort, collect clinical data of additional   RPGRIP1   patients reported previously in the literature, identify common clinical features, and seek genotype\u2013phenotype correlations. \n\n Methods:   Clinical data were collected from 16 patients of our cohort and 212 previously reported   RPGRIP1   patients and included (when available) family history, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction, comprehensive ocular examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, visual fields (VF), and full-field electroretinography (ffERG). \n\n Results:   Out of 228 patients, the majority (197, 86%) were diagnosed with LCA, 18 (7%) with RP, and 13 (5%) with CRD. Age of onset was during early childhood (  n   = 133, average of 1.7 years). All patients but 6 had moderate hyperopia (  n   = 59, mean of 4.8D), and average BCVA was 0.06 Snellen (  n   = 124; only 10 patients had visual acuity [VA] > 0.10 Snellen). On funduscopy, narrowing of blood vessels was noted early in life. Most patients had mild bone spicule-like pigmentation starting in the midperiphery and later encroaching upon the posterior pole. OCT showed thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), while cystoid changes and edema were relatively rare. VF were usually very constricted from early on. ffERG responses were non-detectable in the vast majority of cases. Most of the mutations are predicted to be null (363 alleles), and 93 alleles harbored missense mutations. Missense mutations were identified only in two regions: the RPGR-interacting domain and the C2 domains. Biallelic null mutations are mostly associated with a severe form of the disease, whereas biallelic missense mutations usually cause a milder disease (mostly CRD). \n\n Conclusion:   Our results indicate that   RPGRIP1   biallelic mutations usually cause severe retinal degeneration at an early age with a cone\u2013rod pattern. However, most of the patients exhibit preservation of some (usually low) BCVA for a long period and can potentially benefit from gene therapy. Missense changes appear only in the conserved domains and are associated with a milder phenotype. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLeber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is considered as the most severe form of non-syndromic inherited retinal degeneration. It is usually diagnosed during the first months of life and leads to severe visual impairment or total blindness already at an early age. It is characterized by oculo-digital signs, congenital nystagmus, hypermetropia, and non-recordable electroretinography (ERG) responses ( ;  ;  ). LCA is a genetically heterogeneous disease, and to date, 14 causative genes were identified for LCA (RetNet -- Retinal information Network ); one of these is   RPGRIP1   (retinitis pigmentosa [RP] GTPase regulator interacting protein), which is responsible for approximately 5\u20136% of all LCA cases ( ;  ). \n\nThe   RPGRIP1   gene maps to the 14q11.2 chromosomal region and encodes several different isoforms with distinct cellular, sub-cellular, and biochemical properties ( ). The longest isoform consists of 24 exons and is predicted to encode a protein product of 1,287 amino acids ( ;  ). The RPGRIP1 protein contains several domains: a coiled-coil domain, homologous to proteins involved in vesicular trafficking located at the N-terminus; two C2 domains, which are usually involved in targeting proteins to the cell membrane; a bipartite nuclear localization domain; a C-terminal RPGR-interacting domain; and two parts of seryl tRNA synthetase at the C- and N-termini ( ;  ). In addition, the RPGRIP1 protein includes many phosphorylation, glycosylation, amidation, and myristoylation sites, as well as zinc fingers and leucine zipper structures. \n\nRPGRIP1 was first identified in the outer segments of photoreceptors ( ;  ) and later was reported specifically in centrioles, basal bodies ( ), and photoreceptor connecting cilium ( ). RPGRIP1 expression was also reported in amacrine cells ( ). This protein is a structural protein of the ciliary axoneme in the connecting cilium of all types of photoreceptors ( ;  ). RPGRIP1 has been reported to be involved in anchoring RPGR within the cilium ( ), vesicular trafficking ( ), and directional transport of nascent proteins from the inner segment destined for the outer segment ( ) and participates in disc morphogenesis ( ). \n\nA   Rpgrip1-  knockout mouse line was generated and characterized phenotypically ( ). This mouse model shows abnormal outer segments from a very early age and complete photoreceptor loss at the age of 5 months. In addition, these authors showed that RPGR, a protein that interacts with RPGRIP1, depends on RPGRIP1 for subcellular localization and normal function ( ). Successful gene therapy was performed in the mouse model and also in canine models of RPGRIP1 and was able to restore the localization of RPGR, improve photoreceptor survival, and preserve cone and rod function ( ;  ). Thus, there may be treatment potential for LCA associated with RPGRIP1. \n\nIn the current study, we attempted to characterize clinical phenotypes in a large cohort of patients harboring   RPGRIP1   mutations, integrating clinical data that were reported previously in the literature and clinical data from an Israeli cohort of patients. Our goal is to provide information on the clinical spectrum and course of disease associated with the   RPGRIP1   gene, including identification of characteristic features. The findings can assist in the evaluation and diagnosis of patients globally and provide data on prognosis and may be relevant for therapies such as gene augmentation, which has already been shown to be successful in mouse ( ) and dog models ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nAll methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nWe recruited for the study Israeli and Palestinian individuals with various inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs), including LCA, RP, and cone\u2013rod dystrophy (CRD). Before drawing a blood sample for molecular analysis, all participants in the study or their legal guardians signed an informed consent that adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center and the Rambam Health Care Center IRB committees. \n\n\n### Genetic Analysis \n  \nGenetic analysis was performed by whole exome sequencing (WES) ( ) or molecular inverted probes (MIPs) ( ;  ) analysis, verified by Sanger sequencing of PCR products. Primers for all suspected variants were designed using the Primer3 online program  for mutation screening of the   RPGRIP1   exons and exon\u2013intron boundaries (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_020366.4) by PCR amplification ( ). PCR was performed in a 30-\u03bcl reaction with 35 amplification cycles. The possible pathogenicity of missense changes was evaluated using PolyPhen-2 , MutationTaster , and SIFT . \n\n\n### Clinical Evaluation \n  \nClinical information was collected retrospectively at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Rambam Health Care Center, and related research manuscripts that were published previously ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Clinical data included, when available, anamnestic information on disease onset, progression and different symptoms, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, clinical ocular exam by slit lamp biomicroscopy, full-field electroretinography (ffERG), Goldmann visual fields (VF, using the I4e, III4e, and/or V4e targets according to stage of disease), optical coherence tomography (OCT, using the Heidelberg Spectralis system), color, infrared, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging (using a Zeiss and/or Optos fundus camera and the Heidelberg Spectralis system) ( ). \n\nBest corrected visual acuity was measured at each visit of the patient, and the average of both eyes (BE) was taken. In case the patient underwent cataract surgery and the BCVA improved in the operated eye, measurements prior to surgery that were lower in this eye were corrected to the measurement post-surgery with the thought that this better represents retinal function at that time. In order to provide numerical values for low BCVAs, the following conversions were made: no light perception (NLP) = 0, light perception (LP) = 0.0001, hand movement (HM) = 0.001, and finger count (FC) = 0.01. When necessary, LogMAR of BCVA was converted to the Snellen equivalent using an online converter program  ( ). \n\nVisual fields in previously published articles were measured using different techniques with different default definitions. We were not able to summarize and compare between those measurements. Because most of the available VF data from patients were collected using the Goldmann V4e target, this was the default target we used. \n\nFull-field ERG responses were recorded according to the ISCEV standard using corneal electrodes and a computerized system (UTAS 3000; LKC, MD, United States) as previously described ( ). The average cone flicker amplitude between the two eyes as measured on the earliest ERG test performed in each of the patients was included in our analysis (age at first ERG testing may be indicative of disease severity). \n\n\n### Bioinformatics\u2019 Analysis \n  \nProtein structure, protein domains, and functional sites were identified and sketched using various online platforms: ProSite  , Pfam  , HaMap  , UniProt  , and Motif Scan  . \n\nAmino acid sequences of RPGRIP1 orthologs were extracted from the HomoloGene database at NCBI . The following sequences were used for the analysis: human (NP_065099.3), chimpanzee (PNI22424.1), macaca (XP_028707222.1), dog (NP_001300702.1), cow (XP_024853050.1), rat (XP_017455358.1), mouse (NP_076368.1), frog (XP_012826764.2), and zebrafish (XP_021325946.1). Amino acid sequences were aligned with the ClustalW2 multiple alignment tool at EBI . The sliding window analysis was performed as previously described ( ;  ), with a 50 amino acid interval, between the human RPGRIP1 sequence and each representative ortholog. \n\n\n### Data Availability \n  \nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed in the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identification of   RPGRIP1   Mutations \n  \nOur cohort includes over 2,000 index cases with IRDs. Genetic analyses revealed biallelic   RPGRIP1   mutations in 7 index cases (a total of 16 patients), and all available clinical data from those patients were collected retrospectively. To the best of our knowledge, all the reported cases from our cohort harbored only biallelic   RPGRIP1   mutations. No mutations were identified in other IRD genes. In addition, we collected clinical data from 212 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations previously published in the literature. The data, when available, included general clinical diagnosis of the phenotype, age of first signs or symptoms, refraction, BCVA, ffERG, VF, presence of nystagmus or roving eye movements, photophobia, nyctalopia, oculodigital reflex, and presence of intellectual disability or developmental delay ( ). \n\n\n### MOL0358 \n  \nThe index case (MOL0358-1) belongs to a Christian family originating from Argentina. She manifested nystagmus shortly after birth, and ffERG testing that was performed in Argentina at the age of 4 months was reported to be sub-normal. She was diagnosed with early onset RP, in similarity to her mother and two of her brothers (pedigree is detailed in  ). All four patients (who belong to two generations) were found to be homozygous for c.3663_6del4 ( ) (p.K1221Nfs 22), in the   RPGRIP1   gene ( ). \n  \nPedigrees of the seven families with RPGRIP1 mutations in the Israeli cohort. Family number and the causative mutation (at the cDNA and protein levels) are noted above each pedigree. The number of each subject is listed below each symbol. Shapes marked in black denote an RP phenotype, horizontal stripes indicate a CRD phenotype, and the two individuals with a LCA phenotype are denoted by vertical stripes. White shapes indicate healthy family members. Index cases are marked with black arrows. Underneath each pedigree, a chromatogram of the mutated allele (and when available of a heterozygous allele) is presented. The exact locations of the mutations are marked with rectangles and arrows. \n  \nPatient MOL0358-1 first presented to our clinic at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center at the age of 7 years, and repeated ffERG testing at that time revealed non-detectable responses under both photopic and scotopic conditions. Her visual acuity (VA) was relatively well preserved, and she maintained a BCVA of 0.63 up to the age of 16 ( ). Later on, her BCVA gradually deteriorated, reaching 0.4 in the right eye (RE) and 0.25 in the left eye (LE) on the last exam performed at the age of 24. Her refraction was +2.50/\u22122.75 \u00d7 5\u00b0 in the RE and +1.75/\u22122.50 \u00d7 160\u00b0 in the LE at the age of 19 years ( ). Intraocular pressure (IOP) is within normal limits (WNL). Extraocular muscles (EOM) were full, and the nystagmus has dampened over time. Anterior segments were WNL on repeated exams, with the appearance of mild early posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC) opacity of the lens on her last exam. Fundus examination revealed characteristic signs of RP including optic disc pallor, mild attenuation of the retinal vessels, bone spicule-like pigmentary changes (bone spicule pigmentations [BSPs]), and grayish atrophy in the mid-peripheral retina. In the maculas, there were retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes associated with atrophy encroaching upon the foveas, mainly on the nasal and inferonasal aspects ( ). \n  \nBest corrected visual acuity measurements (presented as Snellen ratio) versus age. Measurements of   RPGRIP1   patients previously reported in the literature are denoted by a blue X. The earliest available measurement for each such patient was taken. BCVA measurements of patients from our cohort are presented as circles, with each color representing a different patient. In this group, all available VA measurements along time are shown. \n    \nSpectrum of fundus findings among   RPGRIP1   patients from our cohort at different ages. Wide field OPTOS pseudocolor and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images show that bone spicule-like pigmentary changes appear at teen years. In older patients (ages 30+), nummular pigmentation was also observed. Diagnosis, patient numbers, and the age at the time of imaging are specified on each of the panels. FAF images of MOL1124-4 from the age of 45 were not available because of technical problems, and FAF images at the age of 48 are shown instead. The FAF image of the left eye of this patient is partially obscured because of cataract. \n  \nOptical coherence tomography imaging was performed almost every year since the age of 12, showing relative conservation of the photoreceptor layer and the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the foveal area, with thinning and loss of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and EZ outside the central macula. No cystoid macular edema (CME) was observed ( ). Widefield FAF imaging shows hyperautofluorescence (hyperAF) around the arcades, with hypoautofluorescent (hypoAF) spots throughout the retina ( ). Goldmann perimetry performed at the age of 12 showed relatively preserved VF. Subsequently, constriction of the VF was noted, with a significant drop in her mid-teens. At the age of 15, her VF were constricted to less than 20\u00b0 from fixation using the V4e target in BE, and 2 years later, it dropped to 5\u00b0 from fixation ( ). \n  \nMacular imaging.   (A)   Representative macular FAF and foveal OCT images of MOL0358-1 over time. Thinning of the photoreceptor layer and narrowing of the central area of ONL and intact EZ can be observed with time. FAF imaging shows increase in the number and size of hypoautofluorescent spots in the macular area along time, some encircling the central macula, with a faint hyperautofluorescent ring around the fovea. The BCVA measured on the day of OCT imaging is specified in the right bottom corner of each scan.   (B)   Macular OCT images from patient MOL1150-1 at the ages of 25 and 35 again show increased thinning of the photoreceptor layer and loss of intact EZ width with age. In patient MOL1124-4 at the age of 45, ONL and EZ are practically lost. The BCVA measured on the day of OCT imaging is specified in the right bottom corner of each scan. \n    \nGoldmann kinetic perimetry.   (A)   Examples of VF from different ages of patient MOL0358-1. Target I4e shown in red, target III4e in green, and target V4e in blue. Rapid constriction of the VF is evident during teen years.   (B)   Visual field areas of MOL0358-1, MOL1124-4, MOL1150-1, and other patients from the literature (using target V4e) plotted versus age. Average VF of MOL0358-1 are presented in red rhombus. Average VF areas of other patients previously published in the literature are represented by circles: Green circles represent the VF of patients from the article by  , and blue circles represent the VF from  . \n  \nThe mother of the index case (MOL0358-3) had a BCVA of 0.1 in the RE and 0.05 in the LE at the age of 39 ( ), with horizontal nystagmus. Astigmatism was found in BE ( ). IOP was 17 mmHg in BE, and a posterior polar cataract was noted. Funduscopy showed symmetric classic signs of RP with central, as well as peripheral, involvement including atrophy in the macular area, reddish-brown pigmentation in the foveal area, and BSP-like pigmentary changes in the periphery. ffERG responses were severely reduced in the RE and undetectable in the LE. Perimetry revealed very constricted VF, to less than 10\u00b0 from fixation in BE. \n\nOne of the brothers of the index case (MOL0358-5) had a BCVA of 0.13 in BE at the age of 8 years ( ). Fundoscopy showed symmetric disease with optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vessels, and typical BSP-like changes in the equatorial and peripheral retinal regions. ffERG responses were severely reduced in BE, and VF were constricted to tunnel vision. \n\n\n### MOL0597 \n  \nFamily MOL0597 is of Arab-Muslim origin, with multiple consanguineous marriages ( ). The index case (MOL0597-1) and his sister (MOL0597-2) first presented to us at the age of 58 and 50 years, respectively, at a relatively advanced stage of disease. Both were homozygous for the c.2249A>G (p.Y750C)   RPGRIP1   mutation previously reported by us ( ;  ). \n\nAt presentation, the index case had a BCVA of 0.33 Snellen in the RE and 0.50 in the LE ( ), with a moderate hypermetropic and astigmatic correction ( ). IOP was 16 mmHg in BE. The patient had mild PSC. Fundus examination revealed mild macular RPE changes and BSPs, as well as pigment clumps outside the arcades. ERG was undetectable in BE under all stimulus conditions. \n\nThe sister of the index case (MOL0597-2) had a BCVA of 0.10 Snellen in BE ( ), with rotatory nystagmus. IOP was 12 mmHg in BE, and PSC were observed. Fundus examination revealed attenuated retinal vessels, macular atrophy, and diffusely scattered BSP-like pigmentary changes. ERG was undetectable. \n\n\n### MOL0600 \n  \nThe index case (MOL0600-1) descends from an Arab-Muslim family and was clinically diagnosed with LCA early in life. First signs were noticed at the age of 1\u20132 months, and already at the age of 7 years, he had no LP in BE. ERG responses were undetectable at that time. This patient was identified to harbor a homozygous novel mutation in   RPGRIP1  , c.1145T>A (p.L382 ) ( ). \n\n\n### MOL1124 \n  \nMOL1124 is a consanguineous family of Arab-Muslim origin (2:2,  ). The index case (MOL1124-1) and his brother (MOL1124-2) were diagnosed with a cone-dominated disease, while a third brother (MOL1124-4) had more severe manifestations and was clinically diagnosed as LCA with prominent cone involvement. All affected brothers were homozygous for the c.2249A>G (p.Y750C) ( ) mutation, in similarity to family MOL0597 ( ). \n\nMOL1124-1 was noted to have photophobia and impaired VA from an early age, but presented to our electrophysiology service only at the age of 21 years. At that time, the patient had a BCVA of FC in BE ( ). Cone responses were impaired, but isolated rod responses were WNL at that time. Interestingly, flash visual evoked potentials (Flash VEP) amplitudes were markedly reduced from the RE, and responses were non-detectable when the LE was stimulated. Of note, fundus exam was reported as normal. Retinal imaging was not performed. \n\nThe brother of the index case (MOL1124-2) was also noted to have photophobia and impaired VA from an early age, but presented to us only at the age of 33 years. At that time, BCVA in BE was 0.1 ( ), with a high astigmatic correction ( ). The anterior segments were WNL, and no cataract was noted. On fundus exam, optic discs, retinal vessels, and retinal periphery were WNL, but macular atrophy was noted. On ffERG testing, cone responses were undetectable, while isolated rod responses following dark adaptation were WNL. Flash VEP amplitudes were reduced also in this brother, with a normal implicit time. \n\nThe third brother in this family (MOL1124-4) was noted to have jerky nystagmus, visual impairment, and photophobia from birth. At the age of 5 years, he had a BCVA of 0.1 with an astigmatic correction of 3 diopters. BCVA deteriorated over time, and at the age of 44 years, his VA was at the level of HM (  and  ). PSC and nuclear sclerotic cataract (NS) also developed over time. Fundus exam at young ages was reported as normal, revealed pigment clumps in the periphery in his 20\u2019s, and at the age of 45 and 48, the patient was noted to have attenuation of retinal vessels, widespread pigment clumps, and BSP-like pigmentary changes ( ). Widefield FAF images at the age of 48 showed multiple hypoAF spots from the arcades to the periphery, with hyperAF in the macular areas. Small hypoAF spots were present in and around the foveas ( ). OCT imaging revealed marked impairment of the outer retina, with loss of ONL and EZ ( ). At the age of 28, ffERG responses were undetectable. Flash VEP responses were WNL in the RE and had reduced amplitudes with a normal implicit time in the LE. Goldmann perimetry at the age of 44 showed markedly constricted fields using the V4e target ( ). \n\n\n### MOL1150 \n  \nThe index case (MOL1150-1) is an isolated case from a consanguineous family of Arab-Muslim origin (2:2;  ). He was diagnosed with early-onset RP at the age of 5 years. Clinical details from that time are not available, but suspicion of disease arose because of poor night vision while VA was quite preserved. BCVA at the age of 25 was 0.50 in each eye, and this was maintained at least to the age of 35, at his last exam ( ). His refraction was \u22123.25/\u22121.50 \u00d7 30\u00b0 in the RE and \u22123.25/\u22121.50 \u00d7 164\u00b0 in the LE. He also has a mild central PSC. At the age of 34 years, funduscopy revealed optic disc pallor and severe attenuation of retinal blood vessels, which were not observed outside the main arcade. The maculas were relatively preserved, and in the midperiphery, grayish atrophy with BSP-like pigmentary changes and pigment clumps were present. Widefield FAF imaging showed hyperfluorescence within the arcades with a hyperfluorescent ring around the foveas ( ). On OCT at the age of 25, residual ONL and an intact EZ were seen in the foveal area in BE with thinning and loss of ONL in parafoveal areas. Ten years later, thinning and some constriction of the ONL islands occurred, and increased irregularity was noted in EZ ( ). At the age of 19, photopic and scotopic FFERG responses were undetectable. Flash VEP responses were WNL in the RE and had mildly reduced amplitudes with a normal implicit time in the LE. This patient was identified with a homozygous mutation in   RPGRIP1  , c.2974delA (p.R992Efs 9) ( ). \n\n\n### MOL1403 \n  \nThis family is an Ashkenazi Jewish family, with mixed origin (Russia, Poland, Hungary, and Germany) and no known consanguinity. The index case (MOL1403-1) and his brother (MOL1403-3) were diagnosed with CRD. \n\nThe index case had nystagmus and photophobia from early childhood. His BCVA at the age of 8 years was 0.10 in BE and remained the same for at least 10 years. His refraction was reported as +2.75 in BE at the age of 4 and +3.25/\u2212100 \u00d7 8\u00b0 in the RE and +4.50/\u2212100 \u00d7 175\u00b0 in the LE at the age of 15. No abnormal fundus findings were reported. On ffERG testing performed at the age of 4 years, rod responses were severely reduced, and cone responses were non-detectable. Flash VEP response was WNL in BE. \n\nThe brother of the index case (MOL1403-3) also had nystagmus from early childhood accompanied by mild photophobia. His BCVA at the age of 5 years was 0.30 in BE, and this was maintained also at his recent exam at age 11. His refraction was +1.25/\u221250 \u00d7 180\u00b0 in the RE and +1.50/\u221225 \u00d7 180\u00b0 in the LE at the age of 7. Fundus exam was reported as WNL. On ffERG testing at the age of 4.5 years, rod responses were moderately reduced, while his cones were non-detectable. The affected siblings from this family were identified to harbor the previously reported homozygous mutation, c.1615_1624del (p.E539Qfs 2) ( ). \n\n\n### TB33 \n  \nIn this consanguineous family (2:2) of Arab-Muslim origin, three siblings are affected ( ). The index case (R73) had nystagmus and nyctalopia from childhood and was diagnosed with RP at the age of 9. At the age of 14, his BCVA was 0.50 ( ). ffERG results showed severely reduced cone responses (RE 20 \u03bcV, 38 ms; LE 30 \u03bcV, 38 ms) and non-detectable rod responses. \n\nHis brother (R74) manifested nystagmus, nyctalopia, and myopia and was diagnosed with RP at the age of 8 years, with somewhat more severe disease than his older brother including constriction of the VF. At the age of 12, his BCVA was 0.4 ( ), and his ERG was not detectable under both scotopic and photopic conditions. \n\nA sister of those siblings (R77) first visited the clinic at the age of few months due to vertical nystagmus. She has not yet undergone ERG testing, but she and her two brothers were identified to manifest a homozygous RPGRIP1 mutation, c.2935C>T (p.Q979 ), which was previously reported by us ( ) as part of the Israeli consortium report ( ). \n\nIn order to assess the spectrum of disease phenotypes associated with   RPGRIP1   mutations, we collected and summarized the clinical data provided for the 212   RPGRIP1   patients reported in the literature and also combined the findings in our cohort of 16 patients. Out of 228 patients, the vast majority (197) were diagnosed with LCA, 18 with RP, and 13 with CRD. Approximately 80% of the patients (179 out of 228) are homozygous for the causative mutation, usually associated with consanguineous or intracommunity marriages. \n\n\n### Signs and Symptoms \n  \nData regarding disease onset were available for 133 patients. First signs usually appeared in early childhood (as could be expected in LCA), with the vast majority of patients showing first signs before the age of 10 years ( ). The average age of first signs or symptoms was 1.7 \u00b1 1.07 years. \n  \n (A)   RPGRIP1 protein structure including protein domains and functional sites and mutation distribution. Major protein domains (  A   bottom): orange rectangle represents the coiled coil domain, green polygon represents the C2-C2_1 and C2 domains, brown ellipse represents the bipartite nuclear localization domain, and blue rectangle represents the RPGR-interacting domain. Gray rectangles above the major domains represent the seryl tRNA synthetase N terminal and C terminal domains, respectively. Additional domains and areas: guanylate-binding protein marked with maroon rectangle, zinc-finger T-antigen with pink rectangle, involucrin repeat with white square, inclusion membrane protein A with purple rectangle, leucine zipper with lavender rectangle, and seven residues repeat with black square. Important sites marked with dots in different colors, as mentioned in the figure. Location of missense mutations is marked with gray circles above the major domains, and null mutations are marked with X below the major domains.   (B)   A plot of location of different mutation types along the protein and the clinical diagnosis of those patients. Gray circles represent the biallelic missense mutations, X represents the biallelic null mutations, and white rectangle represents the compound heterozygous condition with one missense and one null mutation. Frameshift or non-sense mutations that will lead to creation of prematurely truncated protein and are expected to abolish RPGRIP1 function are considered as null mutations.   (C)   A plot of appearance of first signs (as reported by the patient, in years) and location of the different mutation types along the protein. \n  \nBased on positive reports in the different publications, the prevalence of nystagmus among   RPGRIP1   patients is at least 45% (103 out of the 228 patients). At least 16% are photophobic (37 cases), and 12% showed an oculodigital sign (28 cases). In 12 patients (one diagnosed with RP and the rest with LCA), developmental delay, or intellectual disability was reported, but it is not clear whether of primary nature or secondary to the visual impairment. Of note, 3 out of 4 patients homozygous for the c.3565_3571delCGAAGGC mutation were reported to have intellectual disability ( ) as were the 2 patients with the c.1111C>T mutation ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Refraction \n  \nRefractive data were available from 53 patients, and all but 6 were reported to be hyperopic. The 47 hyperopic patients (ages 1\u201339) manifested rather high hyperopia, with a mean spherical equivalent correction of +4.79+/\u22120.8D (SEM). In the four patients reported with high myopia ( ;  ), the exact refractive error was not specified, but interestingly, they all shared the same unique homozygous mutation, c.2889delT (p.Ser964fs), that did not appear in any other   RPGRIP1   patients. These four myopic patients belong to two different families originating from Turkish and Iranian descent. \n\n\n### Visual Acuity \n  \nWe collected data from 124 patients who had VA results, 112 from the literature and 12 from our cohort ( ). When multiple measurements were available in a given patient, the earliest one was taken for the purpose of analysis of mean BCVA. Average Snellen VA was 0.06 \u00b1 0.04 (SEM), with the mean age of measurement being 12.8 \u00b1 4.4 years (SEM). Most of the patients performed their first measurement of VA at an early age, usually before the age of 10 years, and in most cases, rather low acuity was present (FC, HM, LP, or NLP). Only 17 patients had a VA better than 0.1 at the time of initial measurement, and, as can be expected, many of them were not clinically diagnosed with LCA. \n\n\n### Fundus Findings \n  \nWe summarized all the reported observations from previous published papers that included any fundus description ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Variable funduscopic findings were reported for LCA patients harboring mutations in   RPGRIP1  , but in most cases, at early ages, findings were relatively mild ( ;  ). Over time, usually during the first and second decades of life, grayish spots and gray areas of atrophy appeared, along with RPE mottling and gradual attenuation of vessels. Later, migration of pigment that in some cases forms bone spicule-like changes or pigment clumps appears along with waxy pallor of the optic discs ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Some patients demonstrate macular involvement concomitant with the peripheral retinal atrophy ( ;  ). In FAF images, hyperAF is noticeable in the macular area, surrounded by hypoAF areas. Peripheral hypoAF areas appear and extend at later stages of the disease. Examples of fundus photos and FAF images of patients from our cohort are presented in  . \n\n\n### Macular Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Autofluorescence, and Infrared Imaging \n  \nAn overview of OCT images from the literature showed thinning of the retina accompanied by disruption of the ONL, EZ, and RPE layers as the disease progressed ( ;  ;  ). Representative OCT images of   RPGRIP1   patients from the Israeli cohort at different ages are presented in  . Repeated OCT imaging performed over 12 years in patient MOL0358-1 documents structural changes in the macular area during the period in which a major drop in VA and constriction of the VF occurred, correlating with gradual diminution of the central area of retained ONL and intact EZ ( ). Macular FAF imaging at the same time points (on both sides of the OCT scans) shows gradual increase in the number and size of hypoAF spots around the foveas. OCT imaging in patient MOL1150-1 performed a decade apart, at the ages of 25 and 35, shows similar disease progression ( , two upper scans). At the age of 45, OCT scans in patient MOL1124-4 reveal practically total loss of ONL and EZ, as well as disruption of the outer retina/RPE layers with hyperreflective foci in the RE ( , lowest panel). Interestingly, none of our patients showed cystoid changes or macular edema, and CME was also not reported among   RPGRIP1   patients in the literature. \n\n\n### Visual Fields \n  \nPerimetry results in   RPGRIP1   patients were infrequently reported in the literature, probably due to the early age of onset and severe impairment of the VF from early ages that precludes accurate measurements. Among the 212 patients reported in the literature, we were able to collect only 12 reports of Goldmann VF that were measured using the V4e target, but most were reported without an accompanying figure ( ;  ). In a few additional patients, VF were measured using the Octopus perimeter, and in some manuscripts, constricted VF were reported without specifying the method used or the actual results of the measurements. In our cohort, serial Goldmann perimetry in patient MOL0358-1 shows rapid constriction of the VF during her teen years, to less than 7\u00b0 from fixation using the V4e target at age 17 ( ). The course of deterioration in the VF area with age in this patient is shown by red rhombi in  , along with two more patients from our cohort who at the ages of 30 and 45 years had only very small central islands remaining (yellow and orange rhombi). Goldmann VF areas in four additional patients reported in the literature (from two different manuscripts) are also plotted and represented by circles. \n\n\n### Full-Field Electroretinography \n  \nElectroretinography testing results were available for 25/212 patients reported in the literature and in 14/16 patients in our cohort. In the vast majority of cases, testing was performed at very early ages, as part of the workup of babies and young children manifesting severe visual impairment (mean age at ERG testing 8.5 \u00b1 2.5 years). In most cases (27/39), both cone and rod ffERG responses were non-detectable already at the time of first testing, and only in one case, rods were undetectable, while cone responses were severely reduced. In the remaining 10 cases, cone responses were non-detectable, but some residual rod responses, while often very severely reduced, were still measurable. Of note, two siblings from family MOL1124 of our cohort (MOL1124-1 and MOL1124-2) diagnosed with CRD had at age 21 and 33, respectively, non-detectable cone responses, but isolated rod responses were WNL(!) ( ). Interestingly, these brothers carried the c.2249A>G (p.Y750C) mutation in the homozygous state. In two siblings with the same homozygous mutation from another family (MOL0597-1 and MOL0597-2), the course of disease is presumed to also be exceptionally mild, as they were diagnosed only when they reached their 40\u2019s or 50\u2019s. Except these rare patients, according to the ERG results, the majority of   RPGRIP1   patients indeed manifest a LCA phenotype with extinguished ERG responses at the time of first testing, while a minority, when examined at very early ages, manifest severe retinal degeneration with a cone\u2013rod pattern of disease expression. \n\n\n### Genetics and Mutations \n  \nA total of 122 biallelic disease-causing mutations in   RPGRIP1   have been reported thus far in the literature. The most frequently reported mutations were c.1107delA (p.Glu370Asnfs 5) that was reported in 25 LCA patients, c.2480G>T (p.Arg827Leu) in 12 patients (most of whom were diagnosed with LCA and some with CRD), and c.2236G>A (p.Gly746Arg) in 7 LCA patients. \n\nMost of the mutations reported so far are nonsense or splicing mutations that are predicted to be null (101 different mutations representing 363 alleles). The remaining 21 mutations are missense (93 alleles). We collected from the literature data regarding all previously reported mutations and presented them according to their location on the protein sequence ( ). The analysis shows that null mutations are spread all along the protein, while missense mutations occur only in three protein domains: C2-C2_1 domain, C2 domain, and RPGR-interacting domain ( ). According to the scattering of the mutations along the protein, no missense mutations were detected before C2-C2_1 domain, indicating that missense changes in this area are likely to be tolerated. \n  \nProtein domains and evolutionary analysis of   RPGRIP1  .   (A)   A schematic representation of the RPGRIP1 protein. Orange ellipse represents the coiled coil domain, green polygon represents the C2-C2_1 and C2 domains, orange rectangle represents the bipartite nuclear localization domain, and blue rectangle represents the RPGR-interacting domain. Gray rectangles above the major domains represent the seryl tRNA synthetase N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. Frameshift and nonsense mutations are expected to result in a prematurely truncated protein and are therefore considered as null mutations and marked with black X that are located underneath major domains. Missense mutations are marked with gray circles and are located above the major domains.   (B)   A summary of amino acid sliding window (length of 50 amino acids) comparing the human protein sequence to selected orthologs (chimp, macaca, dog, cow, rat, mouse, frog, and zebrafish) is presented. Average of only mammalian sequences (blue) versus all the sequences (orange) is presented.   (C)   An amino acid sliding window comparing the human protein sequence to each ortholog (chimp, macaca, dog, cow, rat, mouse, frog, and zebrafish) is shown.   X  -axis: amino acid number;   Y  -axis: percentage of amino acid identity in a 50 amino acid window. Accession numbers are as follows: human ( ), chimpanzee ( ), macaca ( ), dog ( ), cow ( ), rat ( ), mouse ( ), frog ( ), and zebrafish ( ). The average percentage of amino acid identity for each studied sequence: chimp 98%, macaca 95%, dog 70%, cow 77%, rat 61%, mouse 64%, frog 33%, and zebrafish 29%. \n  \nA sliding window analysis of RPGRIP1 orthologs was performed aiming to gain insight into the conservation pattern of RPGRIP1 along evolution ( ). The analysis highlights a few highly preserved regions that correspond to protein domains, including the seryl tRNA synthetase N-terminal domain, the end of the coiled coil region, the bipartite nuclear localization domain, the C2-C2_1 and the C2 domains, and the seryl tRNA synthetase C-terminal domain. On the other hand, two regions that are part of known domains showed a relatively low level of preservation: the coiled coil domain with an exception of seryl tRNA synthetase N-terminal domain (amino acids (aa) 395\u2013524,  ), where no missense mutations were identified, and the RPGR-interacting domain (aa 1086\u20131286), which is less conserved in the upstream region, and no missense mutations were identified in this region. \n\nIn addition, one can note that in the coiled coil domain (aa 294\u2013584) that includes the seryl tRNA synthetase N-terminal domain (aa 321\u2013384), only null mutation was reported. The C2-C2_1 domain, which is located between aa 619 and 757, contains 19 mutations (a total of 111 reported mutated alleles), 9 of which are null and 10 are missense ( ). This area is highly conserved among all species ( ). The second C2 domain (aa 781\u2013927) contains 23 mutations (a total of 40 alleles), most of which (15 mutations) are null. However, while the null mutations are spread along the whole C2 domain, all missense mutations are concentrated in the middle region of this domain (aa 781\u2013886), and the region is highly conserved ( ). The RPGR-interacting domain (aa 1086\u20131286) is the most C-terminal domain and it includes the seryl tRNA C-terminal domain (aa 1117\u20131282). The seryl tRNA C-terminal domain seems to be much less sensitive to missense changes. A total of 11 mutations (reported in a total of 65 alleles) were reported in this domain, most of which (8) are null. \n\n\n### A Brief Overview of the Reported Mutations and Phenotypes \n  \nTo date (including the cases reported here), 228 biallelic   RPGRIP1   cases have been reported. Of which, 41 patients had biallelic missense mutations (21 were diagnosed with LCA, 15 with CRD/CD, and 5 with RP \u2013 all non-syndromic), 5 were compound heterozygous for a null and a missense mutation (all diagnosed with non-syndromic LCA), and the remaining 182 cases had two null mutations (163 of whom were diagnosed with LCA, 13 with RP, and 6 with CRD). Interestingly, intellectual disability (with or without reported developmental delay) has been reported in 12 out of the 228 cases, all of whom had homozygous biallelic null mutations. \n\nSince three different IRD phenotypes have been reported due to   RPGRIP1   mutations, accompanied by intellectual disability in the minority of cases, we carried out a comprehensive genotype\u2013phenotype analysis, including information on all 228 reported cases aiming to identify potential correlations between mutation type and/or location and clinical features such as phenotype and age of onset. We therefore performed a protein structure analysis ( ) to better characterize relatively small active sites (such as tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, N-myristoylation sites, N-glycosylation sites, casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, amidation sites), as well as larger repeats and domains (including leucine zipper, inclusion membrane protein A, seven residue repeat, guanylate-binding protein, zinc finger large T-antigen D1-type profile, and involucrin repeats areas). The analysis did not reveal any missense mutations within or in close proximity to the above-mentioned sites ( ). \n\nSubsequently, we performed a Chi-square analysis that is based on the distribution of the three different phenotypes between the three possible genotypes (biallelic null, biallelic missense, and compound heterozygous for a null and a missense mutation). The analysis revealed a significant difference in the distribution of CRD cases among the different genotypes (  p   = 1.47 10 ) with a lower than expected number of CRD cases in the null/null group and a higher number of cases in the missense/missense group. Similarly, but with a borderline significance value (  p   = 0.04), LCA cases were more common in the null/null group and less common in the missense/missense group ( ). No significant difference was obtained for RP. \n\nInterestingly, some of the reported mutations show variability in the resulting phenotype, even when they appear as homozygous (e.g., homozygosity for c.1468-2A>G and c.2417C>T can lead to either LCA or RP, c.2480G>T and c.3565C>T to LCA or CRD, and c.2249A>G to either LCA, RP, or CRD). \n\nData regarding disease onset were available for 133 patients. First signs appeared usually in early childhood (the vast majority of patients experienced first signs earlier than the age of 10 years,  ), with an average age of first signs or symptoms of 1.7 \u00b1 1.07 years. Correlation analysis between genotype (missense/missense, null/missense, and null/null) and age of onset ( ) did not reveal a significant difference. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this article, we summarize and present clinical data of 228 patients with biallelic   RPGRIP1   mutations. Sixteen of those patients belong to the Israeli cohort and are presented in this study for the first time. The remaining patients, to the best of our knowledge, reflect all   RPGRIP1   cases described in the literature up to the cutoff date of our search that was January 31, 2021. Out of 228 patients, 179 are homozygous for the disease-causing mutation, indicating probable consanguinity or intracommunity marriages in the background. Patients with biallelic   RPGRIP1   mutations are usually reported to express a LCA phenotype (197, 86%), but also RP (18, 7%) and CRD (13, 5%) phenotypes were described. In the Israeli cohort of patients, the phenotype tends to be milder, with most of the patients clinically diagnosed as RP (10, 62.5%) or CRD (4, 25%) and only a minority reported to have LCA (2, 12.5%). These three phenotypes essentially lie along a spectrum and may overlap in their clinical appearance, especially if seen at different stages of disease, such that the distinction between them is not always clear. Our impression is that LCA with prominent cone involvement is the phenotype that best describes the majority of cases. \n\nWorldwide, 5\u20137% of LCA cases are reported to be caused by mutations in   RPGRIP1   ( ;  ;  ). In the Israeli cohort of patients, out of 144 patients (112 families) with a LCA phenotype (of which 94 families are genetically diagnosed), approximately 1.5% of cases (2 patients) are due to biallelic   RPGRIP1   mutations. However, there is a higher prevalence of   RPGRIP1   patients who manifest milder disease in our cohort (14/16 patients). As will be detailed below, this does not seem to be related to the prevalence of missense versus null mutations among our patients. \n\nInterestingly, different clinical phenotypes (LCA, RP, or CRD) can appear in families with the same homozygous mutation and even within the same family, as is also reported here. For example, MOL0597 and MOL1124 (both of Arab-Muslim descent) have the same homozygous c.2249A>G (p.Y750C) mutation with two siblings in MOL0597 manifesting RP, while in MOL1124, two brothers manifest CRD, and the third manifests LCA. In the literature, we were able to identify additional mutations that are associated with variable phenotypes, either within the same article or reported in different articles. These include c.1306G>T (p.A436S) associated with LCA or CRD ( ), c.2417C>T (p.T806I) reported with LCA or RP ( ), c.2480G>T (p.R827L) reported with LCA ( ) or CRD ( ) in two different articles, and c.1468-2A>G as the cause of LCA ( ) or RP ( ). Such differences in clinical diagnosis may be explained by human factor \u2013 examination by different clinicians in different centers, located in different countries, and perhaps at different ages of the patients. However, there are cases when patients were examined in the same center by the same clinicians and still received different clinical diagnoses. Inter- and intra-familial variability of disease expression even when the same gene and mutation are present is not rare in IRDs in general, and common explanations for this phenomenon include possible modifying genetic and environmental factors. For example, in the case of   RPGR   (which also interacts with   RPGRIP1  ), mutant mice from different genetic backgrounds that share the same mutation demonstrated a very different course of disease: a rod-dominated phenotype was observed in mice on a BL/6 background and cone-dominated disease was observed for the same mutation in BALB/c mice ( ). Specifically in the case of   RPGRIP1  , a number of studies probed this issue of phenotypic variability in the canine model of Rpgrip1 retinal degeneration, in which different ages of onset and variable severity of disease are seen in dogs with the same   RPGRIP1   mutation ( ;  ;  ). Forman and colleagues hypothesized that differences in age of onset may be explained by modifier genes such as   MAP9   ( ).   suggested a multigenic explanation for the phenotypic variability.   demonstrated leakiness of the frameshift mutation present in these dogs that may also explain the variable appearance of disease in Rpgrip1  dogs. Interestingly, some of the mutations listed above associated with different phenotypes in human patients are also frameshift mutations that may lead to splicing errors, and perhaps similar \u201cleakiness\u201d can explain the difference in disease severity among these patients. \n\nEvolutionary analysis of the RPGRIP1 protein in different species led to the identification of highly conserved regions in the three domains in which missense changes were pathogenic. We identified additional highly conserved regions in protein domains (including the N-terminal seryl t-RNA synthetase domain, the end of the coiled coil domain, and the bipartite nuclear localization domain), but no missense mutations were reported in these regions. This can be explained by retained partial protein activity in alleles that bear missense mutations or even in-frame deletions, as reported to be the case for the N-terminal seryl tRNA synthetase domain that was studied in   Escherichia coli   ( ). None of the missense mutations was identified in biochemically active sites (19 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, 17 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 7 N-myristoylation sites, 5 N-glycosylation sites, 3 amidation sites, and 2 tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites), which might indicate overlapping functions of these sites. \n\nPrevious publications ( ;  ;  ) suggested that the LCA phenotype is usually caused by premature termination codons or null alleles, while a less severe form of the disease, CRD, is associated with missense mutations that retain partial function of the protein. After preforming Chi-square analysis on possible phenotypes and genotypes, we indeed identified significant differences in the distribution of CRD and LCA cases. CRD phenotypes were more common in the biallelic missense group and much less common in the biallelic null group, while LCA phenotypes showed the opposite pattern. This finding indicates that two null alleles tend to cause more severe disease than two missense alleles. It should be noted that the patients included in this article were diagnosed in many different centers and they were examined at different stages of their disease, factors that could influence the way their phenotype was defined. \n\nIntellectual disability or developmental delay was reported in 12 patients with RPGRIP1 disease ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Interestingly, two specific RPGRIP1 mutations (c.3565_3571delCGAAGGC \u2013 three patients from two families and c.1111C>T \u2013 two patients from two families) were reported only in patients with intellectual disability or developmental delay. Recessive mutations in RPGRIP1L, which is a homolog of RPGRIP1, can cause systematic ciliopathies like Joubert syndrome-7 ( ), Meckel syndrome 5 ( ), and COACH syndrome 3 ( ), which also involve intellectual disability. RPGRIP1L and RPGRIP1 are known to interact with the NPHP4 C2 domain ( ;  ), and mutations in both can cause developmental delay by interfering with neuronal development ( ). It is possible that developmental delay or intellectual disability in patients with   RPGRIP1   mutations is caused by the same molecular pathway. Alternatively, since all 12 patients with intellectual disability or developmental delay had homozygous mutations, we cannot exclude the possibility that underlying consanguineous or intracommunity marriages elevate the risk for intellectual disability caused by other recessive inherited causes. \n\nMost of the patients reported first signs of disease very early in life, compatible with the majority being diagnosed with LCA. While low vision was present in practically all patients, many signs and symptoms were not constitutive in their appearance. For example, nystagmus and oculodigital signs do not appear in all patients. While most of the patients are hyperopic ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), some myopic patients were identified ( ;  ); most of the patients reported light aversion ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), but some emphasize nyctalopia as a major visual symptom ( ;  ;  ).   suggested a clinical flowchart according to which a child manifesting nystagmus, profound visual deficiency, and unrecordable ERG at birth or during the first months of life and developing photophobia, showing hypermetropia with a refractive error lower than +7, and VA better than FC, but worse than 1/20, will probably have RPGRIP1 or AIPL1 mutations. While this flowchart holds true for many of the 228 RPGRIP1 patients included in the present analysis (from multiple centers and publications), not all patients with   RPGRIP1   causative mutations have nystagmus from birth (156 patients, which are 68%), a minority still have recordable ERG responses even after the age of 10 years, approximately 25% of patients are nyctalopic, 20% (25/124, 7 of them had NLP) of patients had VA lower than FC ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and 25% (32/124) had a VA better than 1/20 ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition, there are patients who are myopic ( ;  ) or have hypermetropia higher than +7 ( ;  ,  ). Approximately 55% of the patients indeed had VA within the range suggested by   usually measured early in life (before the age of 10). A wide spectrum of findings is not uncommon in many inherited retinal degenerations. \n\nDespite low VA and appearance of other signs and symptoms early in life, fundus findings at infancy and early childhood are relatively mild (as previously reported in the literature and summarized by us), and appearance of pigmentary changes or grayish spots of atrophy occurs in late childhood or teen years, with BSP-like pigmentary changes appearing even later in life. According to all the collected reports from the literature, thinning of the retina accompanied by disruption of the ONL appears from early stages of the disease, later also involving the EZ. Complete degeneration of the ONL and total disruption of the EZ do not appear at a defined age range and differ from patient to patient according to the course of disease. \n\nFew perimetry results of RPGRIP1 patients are reported in the literature. VF that are done in different centers using different methods are not easily comparable, but in general, reported VF in RPGRIP1 patients are constricted from early ages, with few exceptions such as case MOL0358-1 described above in which VF deteriorated during her teen years. \n\nElectroretinography results were available for only 39 patients: most patients indeed manifest a LCA phenotype with extinguished ERG responses, while a minority, when examined at very early ages, manifest severe retinal degeneration with a cone\u2013rod pattern of disease expression. \n\nIn summary, after reviewing all previously published papers, it appears that mutations in the   RPGRIP1   gene can cause severe retinal degeneration, which is usually characterized by rapid deterioration in visual function during the first years of life. However, very few patients (7/124 for which VA was reported) reach NLP. Thus, most of the patients preserve some (usually low) VA for a long period (several decades), indicating that some functional photoreceptors still exist and could potentially be a target for gene augmentation therapy. Recent publications on successful gene therapy in mouse and dog models of RPGRIP1 retinal degeneration were published ( ;  ) and demonstrated preservation of retinal function in treated areas. In the mouse model, survival of photoreceptors, preservation of their morphology, and better preservation of ERG responses were reported ( ). In dogs, improved structure and function was reported even 24 months after subretinal injection of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) vector carrying the   RPGRIP1   gene ( ). RPGRIP1 patients who still have evidence for retained ONL on OCT imaging may stand to benefit from similar therapy. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly available.

We are interested in studying how combinations of genetic ancestry in admixed Latin American populations may impact genomic determinants of health and disease. For this study, we characterized the impact of ancestry and admixture on genetic variants that underlie health- and disease-related phenotypes in population genomic samples from Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe analyzed a total of 347 admixed Latin American genomes along with 1102 putative ancestral source genomes from Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans. We characterized the genetic ancestry, relatedness, and admixture patterns for each of the admixed Latin American genomes, finding a spectrum of ancestry proportions within and between populations. We then identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with anomalous ancestry-enrichment patterns, i.e. SNPs that exist in any given Latin American population at a higher frequency than expected based on the population\u2019s genetic ancestry profile. For this set of ancestry-enriched SNPs, we inspected their phenotypic impact on disease, metabolism, and the immune system. All four of the Latin American populations show ancestry-enrichment for a number of shared pathways, yielding evidence of similar selection pressures on these populations during their evolution. For example, all four populations show ancestry-enriched SNPs in multiple genes from immune system pathways, such as the cytokine receptor interaction, T cell receptor signaling, and antigen presentation pathways. We also found SNPs with excess African or European ancestry that are associated with ancestry-specific gene expression patterns and play crucial roles in the immune system and infectious disease responses. Genes from both the innate and adaptive immune system were found to be regulated by ancestry-enriched SNPs with population-specific regulatory effects. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAncestry-enriched SNPs in Latin American populations have a substantial effect on health- and disease-related phenotypes. The concordant impact observed for same phenotypes across populations points to a process of adaptive introgression, whereby ancestry-enriched SNPs with specific functional utility appear to have been retained in modern populations by virtue of their effects on health and fitness. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5195-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe modern human species \u2013   Homo sapiens sapiens   \u2013 originated in sub-Saharan Africa ~\u2009200,000\u00a0years ago and began to migrate out of Africa and spread throughout the world starting ~\u200970,000\u00a0years ago [ ,  ]. After heading north out of Africa, humans spread to the east and west, populating Melanesia, Asia, and Europe, and eventually made their way across the Bering Strait into the Americas ~\u200920,000\u00a0years ago. As human populations occupied different parts of the globe, they often became geographically isolated in their new homelands. Thousands of years of geographic isolation were accompanied by population genetic diversification, giving rise to the diverse human population groups that can be seen around the world to this day [ ,  ]. Distinct continental population groups \u2013 African, Asian, and European in particular \u2013 are the most obvious examples of this evolutionary process. There were, of course, a number of episodes of genetic admixture during this time [ ], whereby previously isolated populations came into contact and began to mix, but for the most part, the dominant mode of human evolution since our emergence from Africa has been characterized by populations\u2019 physical isolation followed by genetic diversification. \n\nThis pattern of human evolution was turned upside down upon the arrival of Columbus in the New World a mere 500\u00a0years ago, which is less than 1% of the elapsed time since humans emerged from Africa. Columbus\u2019 voyages precipitated the so-called \u2018Columbian Exchange\u2019 \u2013 a massive transfer of life forms, which had evolved separately for millennia, between the Old and New World hemispheres [ ,  ]. The human dimension of the Columbian Exchange entailed genetic admixture between previously isolated populations on an unprecedented scale, in terms of both scope and rapidity [ ]. The conquest and colonization of the Americas, along with the trans-Atlantic slave trade, brought African, European, and Native American populations into close and sustained contact for the first time. As a consequence, these diverse population groups began to mix, giving rise to novel admixed American populations. This is particularly true for Latin America, where populations are characterized by high levels of genetic admixture among African, European, and Native American ancestral source populations [ \u2013 ]. \n\nLatin American genomes can thus be considered to represent a recent innovation in human evolution. Indeed, genomes from modern Latin American populations are evolutionarily novel in the sense that they contain combinations of genetic variants (haplotypes) that never previously existed together on the same genetic background. Our group is interested in trying to understand the implications of the recent advent of novel Latin American genomes, particularly as it relates to the genetic determinants of health-related phenotypes. In other words, we are asking what it means when genomes that were separated for many thousands of years are suddenly brought back together and what the implications of this process are for human health and fitness. \n\nOur group and others have employed an approach that we call ancestry-enrichment analysis to address these kinds of questions via population-level studies of admixed American genomes [ ]. This approach relies on the characterization of local patterns of genetic ancestry for individual genomic loci. Local ancestry assignment, colloquially referred to as chromosome painting, entails the delineation of ancestral origins of specific haplotypes across the genome. The resulting chromosome paintings reveal the genomes of admixed individuals as mosaics of interspersed ancestry-specific haplotypes. When a population sample of admixed genomes is characterized in this way, the percent ancestry contributions from each ancestral source population can be computed for all haplotype loci genome-wide. Ancestry-enrichment analysis then entails the identification of specific haplotype loci that have anomalous patterns of local ancestry, i.e. levels of locus-specific ancestry that are significantly higher or lower than can be expected by chance given the overall ancestry profile of the population. Statistically significant signals of ancestry-enrichment are taken as evidence of adaptive introgression, whereby introgressed haplotypes increase in frequency by virtue of a selective advantage that they provide to individuals in an admixed population. \n\nA number of recent studies have used ancestry-enrichment analysis to show evidence of adaptive introgression in admixed American genomes. The first study of this kind showed an excess of African ancestry at the major histocompatibility locus (MHC) in a sample of Puerto Rican genomes [ ], and a follow up study several years later also found ancestry-enrichment at the same region in a Mexican population [ ]. Since that time, several other studies have replicated the finding of ancestry-enrichment in admixed populations at this and other health related loci [ \u2013 ]. Our own more recent work on Colombian genome sequences revealed even more widespread ancestry-enrichment, which impacted various aspects of the immune system, including pathways involved in both innate and adaptive immunity [ ]. \n\nAll of the previous ancestry-enrichment studies were distinguished by their interrogation of the ancestral origins of individual haplotypes, i.e. physically linked sets of genetic variants that are inherited together. For this study, we developed and applied a novel method based on individual genetic variants \u2013 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) \u2013 in an effort to expand our view of the relationship between genetic ancestry, admixture and health in Latin American populations. Our approach entails the detection of SNPs that are found at anomalously high frequencies in admixed populations compared to what is expected based on their frequencies in the ancestral source populations, i.e. ancestry-enriched SNPs. To find such ancestry-enriched SNPs, we consider the proportional contributions of ancestral source populations to admixed Latin American populations, together with SNP frequencies in the ancestral populations, to derive expected SNP frequencies for the Latin American populations. These expected frequencies are compared to observed frequencies in order to identify statistically significant ancestry-enriched SNPs; the connection between ancestry-enriched SNPs and health-related phenotypes is then explored via analysis of the functional annotations of the SNPs and their linked genes. In particular, we interrogated the impact of ancestry-enriched SNPs on disease, metabolism and immune system pathways. This approach uncovered signals of ancestry-enrichment in health- and disease-related traits shared among all four of the Latin American populations that we analyzed, raising the possibility of shared selective pressures among them. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Comparative genomic data sources \n  \nWhole genome sequences from four admixed Latin American populations \u2013 Colombia (  n  \u2009=\u200994), Mexico (  n  \u2009=\u200964), Peru (  n  \u2009=\u200985), and Puerto Rico (  n  \u2009=\u2009104) \u2013 were taken from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) phase 3 data release [ ]:  . Genome sequences from the four Latin American populations were compared to whole genome sequences and whole genome genotypes of global reference populations from African, European, and Native American continental population groups to characterize their patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). The global reference whole genome sequences were also taken from the 1KGP, and reference whole genome genotype data was taken from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [ ]. The whole genome sequence and whole genome genotype data were merged, with sites that existed in both datasets retained for subsequent analysis, and PLINK v1.9 [ ] was used to correct single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) strand orientation as needed. This resulted in a dataset of 435,782 SNPs from 1449 individuals, across 19 populations. The final merged SNP dataset was phased with the 1KGP haplotype reference panel using the program SHAPEIT2 [ ].   \nAnalysis scheme used for this study. (1) Genetic ancestry and admixture profiles were characterized for four Latin American populations. (2) Expected SNP frequencies in the admixed Latin American populations are calculated based on their ancestry profiles. (3) Ancestry-enriched SNPs are identified by comparing observed versus expected SNP allele frequencies in in the admixed Latin American populations. (4) Ancestry-enriched SNPs are mapped to genes, which in turn are used for gene set enrichment in order to identify impacted health-related pathways and phenotypes \n    \nHuman populations analyzed in this study \n  \nPopulations are organized into continental groups: African, East Asian, European, and Admixed American from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and Native American from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Short names, descriptions, and the numbers of genomes analyzed are provided for each individual population \n  \n\n\n### Genome ancestry assignment \n  \nADMIXTURE [ ] was run on individuals from both the global reference and admixed Latin American populations to infer their genome-wide ancestry profiles. ADMIXTURE was run with   K  \u2009=\u20093 corresponding the three ancestral continental population groups: African, European, and Native American. The ADMIXTURE results for the admixed Latin American populations were used to infer individuals\u2019 percent ancestry contributions from each of these three continental ancestry groups. The program RFMix [ ] was used to assign the continental ancestry origins of individual haplotypes across the genome, i.e. local ancestry. As with ADMIXTURE, African, European, and Native American populations were used as reference populations for RFMix. Ancestry-specific haplotypes were only called for regions where RFMix certainty was at least 99%. \n\n\n### Detection of ancestry-enriched SNPs \n  \nAncestry-enriched SNPs were characterized as SNPs found in higher frequencies in admixed Latin American populations compared to what is expected based on (1) their frequencies in the ancestral source populations, and (2) the proportion of ancestry derived from each ancestral source population. For any given SNP, in any given Latin American population, the expected frequency of the SNP   f  (  SNP  )  can be calculated as: \n\nwhere   f  (  SNP  )  is the frequency of the SNP in a specific ancestral source population and   P  (  Anc  )  is the proportion of ancestry in the modern Latin American population derived from that same ancestral population. Ancestry proportions were computed using the reduced, merged set of SNPs described above, with African and European reference populations from the 1KGP and Native American reference populations from HGDP. SNP frequencies were computed using whole genome sequences, in order to provide more complete coverage of variants genome-wide, using the YRI African and IBS European reference populations with the most closely related East Asian population CHB taken as a surrogate for Native American ancestry. \n\nThe statistical significance of SNP ancestry-enrichment calculated this way was determined by comparing the observed (  Obs  ) to expected (  Exp  ) frequencies of the reference (  Ref  ) and alternate (  Alt  ) alleles for any given SNP as shown here: \n\n\n\nThe   \u03c7   distribution was used to calculate   P  -values for each SNP, and false discovery rate (FDR)   q  -values were used to account for multiple statistical tests. The SNPs that had significant FDR values (  q  \u2009<\u20090.05) were considered to be ancestry-enriched in the Latin American population, i.e. present at a higher frequency than expected based on the population ancestry profile. \n\nFor ancestry-enriched SNPs, the individual ancestry components (  Anc  ) that gave rise to the pattern of enrichment were also determined by jointly minimizing the frequency difference between the SNP in the Latin American population and a single ancestral source population while maximizing the distance between that single source population and the other two ancestral populations: \n\n\n\nwhere   f  (  SNP  )  is the frequency of the SNP in each of the ancestral source populations and\u00a0  f  (  SNP  )  is the frequency of the ancestry-enriched SNP in the Latin American population. \n\n\n### Gene set enrichment analysis \n  \nAncestry-enriched SNPs were mapped to genes if they mapped within the NCBI RefSeq [ ] gene models, i.e. between transcription start and stop sites, on the UCSC Genome Browser human genome reference sequence build GRCh37/hg19. Functionally coherent gene sets were curated from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) version 5.1 [ ] for three broad functional categories: health- and disease-related phenotypes, metabolism, and immunity. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed for each Latin American population by adopting the MSigDB statistical framework to find functional gene sets that were enriched for genes with mapped ancestry-enriched SNPs. To do this, genes that harbor ancestry-enriched SNPs were overlapped with genes from each functional gene set, and overlap enrichment was performed using the R limma package [ ]. Overlap enrichment   P  -values were computed for each gene set using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. \n\n\n### Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis \n  \nRNA-seq data were taken from the GUEVADIS RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) project for 1KGP samples  . A total of 445 RNA-seq samples were used in the analysis, including 87 African and 358 European individuals. The RNA-seq data correspond to gene expression levels for the same lymphoblastoid cell lines, i.e. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) transformed B-lymphocytes, which were used for the 1KGP DNA-seq characterization. RNA-seq sample preparation, sequencing experiments and read-to-genome mapping were performed as previously described [ ]. The read-to-genome mapping corresponds to human genome build GRCh37/hg19. Gene expression levels were quantified based on RNA-seq mapped reads and corresponded to ENSEMBL gene models [ ]. Gene expression levels were quantified by using the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) approach in combination with the probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) method as previously described [ ,  ]. \n\nMatched whole genome sequencing based SNP genotype calls were obtained for the same 445 individuals from the phase 3 release of the 1KGP [ ]. Only SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 5% were used for the downstream analysis to ensure both the confidence of genotype calls and the reliability of the eQTL association analyses. Gene expression levels of 445 individuals were then regressed against their SNP genotypes to identify eQTLs using the program Matrix eQTL [ ]. The Matrix eQTL program was run using the additive linear model option with gender and population labels included as covariates. \n\n\n### SNP pathway meta-analysis \n  \nMeta-analysis was used to evaluate the overall ancestry-enrichment for sets of SNPs that are implicated in specific health- or disease-related pathways. For any given ancestry-enriched SNP that mapped to a gene found in an overrepresented pathway, a log odds ratio was calculated as: \n\n\n\nwhere the observed (  Obs  ) versus expected (  Exp  ) frequencies (  f  ) are compared for the SNP reference (  Ref  ) versus alternate (  Alt  ) alleles. Then for each pathway, the set of individual SNP log odds ratios was combined to yield pathway-specific log odds ratio values along with 95% confidence intervals using the fixed-effect model with moderators via linear (mixed-effect) models implemented in the metafor package in R [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Relating genome ancestry and health in Latin America \n  \nWe developed and applied a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approach to relate genome ancestry to genetic determinants of health in admixed Latin American populations (Fig.  ). First, patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture in Latin American populations were characterized via comparison with reference genome sequences of putative ancestral source populations from Africa, the Americas and Europe (Table  ). We then computed the expected SNP frequencies in Latin American populations by taking into consideration the SNP frequencies in the ancestral source populations along with the proportional contributions of each ancestral source population to the modern Latin American populations. Comparisons of observed versus expected SNP frequencies in admixed Latin American populations were used to identify what we refer to as \u2018ancestry-enriched\u2019 SNPs, which are SNPs found at anomalous frequencies in Latin American populations compared to what can be expected based on their ancestry profiles. Ancestry-enriched SNPs were mapped to genes, and then genes were used in gene set enrichment analysis to identify impacted health-related pathways and phenotypes. \n\n\n### Genetic ancestry and admixture in four Latin American populations \n  \nGenome sequences from four Latin American populations \u2013 Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico \u2013 were compared to whole genome sequences and whole genome genotypes of global reference populations from African, European, and Native American continental population groups in order to characterize their patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture. Each Latin American population has a distinct pattern of three-way continental genetic admixture characterized by population-specific proportions of African, European and Native American ancestry (Fig.\u00a0 ). Puerto Rico and Colombia are characterized by relatively high levels of three-way admixture, with substantial ancestry contributions from all three continental population groups, whereas Mexico and Peru have primarily Native American and European ancestry. Puerto Rico and Colombia also have the highest levels of European ancestry, while Peru and Mexico have majority Native American ancestry. The 80% Native American ancestry component for Peru is the single highest contribution of any ancestral population to an admixed Latin American population, and the 2% African ancestry fraction for this same population is the lowest. African source populations contribute the least amount of ancestry to all four Latin American populations analyzed here. The continental ancestry proportions for each Latin American population were used as described in the following section to detect ancestry-enriched SNPs that exist in any given population at a higher frequency than expected based on its ancestry profile.   \nGenetic ancestry and admixture in Latin American populations. The ancestry contributions of putative ancestral source populations to four modern, admixed Latin American populations are shown.   a   Triangle plots showing the relative ancestry contributions \u2013 African, European, Native American \u2013 to admixed individuals from four Latin American populations.   b   PCA plot showing the genetic relationships among individuals from admixed Latin American populations compared to putative ancestral source populations.

We reasoned that such ancestry-enriched SNPs are likely to have an outsized effect on health and disease in modern Latin American populations, perhaps related to an initial increase in population frequency via adaptive introgression. \n\nWe developed and applied a quantitative method to identify individual SNPs that are enriched in admixed Latin American populations with respect to ancestry from one of the three ancestral source populations: Africa, Europe, and the Americas. To do so, the expected frequencies for each SNP were calculated using the frequency of the given SNP in each of the three ancestral source populations conditioned upon the proportion of each ancestral source population in the Latin American population of interest. Observed SNP frequencies were compared to expected SNP frequencies to identify ancestry-enriched SNPs; the details of this approach are shown in the Materials and Methods section. \n\nThe distributions and median values of ancestry-specific SNP \u03c7  values are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Peru shows the strongest overall signal of SNP ancestry-enrichment, followed by Mexico, Colombia, and Puerto Rico. Statistically significant ancestry-enriched SNPs for each population were mapped to genes for subsequent analysis of their impact on health- and disease-related phenotypes. There is a substantial amount of overlap of mapped genes among the four populations (Fig.  ). Out of 156 total genes with mapped ancestry-enriched SNPs, 102 (65%) are shared among two or more populations compared to 54 (35%) that are population-specific. There are 40 genes that bear ancestry-specific SNPs in all four Latin American populations, which is by far the single largest component of shared versus unique genes. Lists of all SNPs that show significant ancestry-enrichment \u2013 along with details regarding their observed and expected allele frequencies, test-statistic values, and specific ancestry enrichment patterns \u2013 can be found in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S1.   \nAncestry-enriched SNPs in Latin American populations. An overview of the distributions of ancestry-enriched SNPs within and between the four admixed Latin American populations are shown, giving an indication of the overall numbers of ancestry-enriched SNPs along with the extent to which they are shared or unique to specific populations.   a   Cumulative distributions of ancestry-enrichment   \u03c7   values for all SNPs in the four Latin American populations.

This approach allowed us to identify the specific pathways and phenotypes that are most affected by ancestry-enriched SNPs. The presence of significantly overrepresented pathways and/or phenotypes in two or more populations was taken to indicate a higher likelihood of genetic ancestry effects on health and disease in modern Latin American populations.   \nGene set enrichment analysis of ancestry-enriched SNP genes. Functionally coherent gene sets and pathways that are overrepresented with respect to ancestry-enriched SNPs are shown, giving an indication of the kinds of health-related phenotypes that have been shaped by genetic ancestry in the four admixed Latin American populations.   a   Heatmap showing significantly enriched functional gene sets (i.e., pathways and phenotypes) shared by two, three or all four Latin American populations. The cells are color coded by the log transformed statistical significance (FDR   q  -value) of gene set enrichment analysis results.   b   Network showing significantly enriched pathways and phenotypes shared by all four Latin American populations. Nodes sizes represent the number of ancestry-enriched genes in each set. Pie charts show how many genes in a given set are from each population. Color coding describes the functional enrichment category as shown in the legend \n  \n\nA number of pathways and phenotypes have significantly overrepresented ancestry-enriched SNP genes in all four populations (Fig.  ). These include gene sets related to immunity (yellow) and metabolism (orange) as well as several disease-specific gene sets (blue) (Fig.  ). Immune system pathways with ancestry-enriched SNPs include the cytokine receptor interaction, T cell receptor signaling, and antigen processing and presentation pathways. Implicated metabolic pathways include both drug and xenobiotic metabolism as well as steroid hormone biosynthesis. Diseases of note include several pathologies that are known to be found in high prevalence in Latin American populations: type I diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Leishmaniasis. A number of other signaling pathways were implicated by this analysis \u2013 calcium, MAPK, and GNRH signaling \u2013 pointing a role for ancestry-enriched SNPs in mediating human-environment interactions. Lists of all pathways that show significant enrichment of genes with mapped ancestry-enriched SNPs, for each admixed Latin American population \u2013 along with information regarding the overlapping genes and pathway enrichment statistical significance (FDR   q  -values) \u2013 are provided in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Table S2. \n\nWe focused on several notable examples of health- and disease-related pathways that were found to have significantly overrepresented ancestry-enriched SNP genes in all four Latin American populations (Fig.\u00a0 ). For each of these pathways, and in each population studied, we performed additional meta-analyses of the sets of mapped ancestry-enriched SNPs in order to evaluate the pathway\u2019s overall ancestry enrichment. We also computed analogous overall observed versus expected allele frequencies for each pathway in all four populations. There are 15 genes from the Leishmaniasis immune response pathway with mapped ancestry-enriched SNPs, including a pair of Toll-like Receptor encoding genes as well as several interleukin genes (Fig.  ). The meta-analysis for this pathway shows an overall ancestry-enrichment for all SNPs in each of the four populations analyzed here. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease with high prevalence in the tropics and subtropics including Latin America. Similar pathway-specific analysis revealed overall ancestry-enrichment for SNPs linked to drug metabolism (Fig.  ), including multiple genes from the cytochrome P450 family, as well as the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which is activated by cytokines as part of the innate immune response (Fig.  ). The ancestry-enrichment observed for the drug metabolism pathway could represent an adaptation based on detoxification linked to local dimensions of diet and environmental exposure in the New World.   \nPathways with ancestry-enriched SNP genes in functional categories of interest  .   These results highlight examples of specific health-related functions and pathways that have been shaped by genetic ancestry in the four admixed Latin American populations. For each functional category, a pathway schematic is shown, indicating the pathway genes and their roles, along with meta-analysis results and observed versus expected SNP frequencies for each population.   a   Leishmaniasis, an example of a disease and health related pathway.   b   Cytochrome P450 drug metabolism, an example of a metabolism related pathway.   c   Jak-STAT signaling pathway, an example of an immune-related pathway \n  \n\n\n### Ancestry-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) \n  \nWe explored the effects of ancestry-specific SNPs on gene regulation via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. eQTL are individual SNPs with genotype variants that are associated with gene expression levels; associations of this kind point to a role for SNP variants in gene regulation (e.g., via differential transcription factor binding affinities and/or allele specific expression levels) [ ,  ]. To do this, we searched for ancestry-enriched SNPs that have ancestry-specific or shared genotype-expression associations. The first step of this analysis entailed the identification of the specific ancestry-components that predominantly contribute to the observed patterns of SNP ancestry-enrichment (see Materials and Methods). SNPs with highly asymmetric ancestry-enrichment patterns, i.e. predominant contributions from a single ancestral source population, were then chosen for eQTL analysis. \n\nUsing this approach, we found a number of cases of SNPs that show overrepresented African or European ancestry in modern Latin American populations and are also associated with ancestry-specific gene regulation (Fig.\u00a0 ). A number of the genes regulated by ancestry-specific SNPs were found to play specific roles in the immune system and infectious disease responses. In particular, genes from both the innate and adaptive immune system were found to be regulated by ancestry-enriched SNPs that exert population-specific regulatory effects (Fig.  ). For example, African ancestry-enriched SNPs were found to exert African-specific regulatory control over genes for both immunoglobulin receptors (PVR and TYROBP) and a downstream tyrosine kinase (ZAP70) involved in the adaptive immune response (Fig.  ). Similarly, European ancestry-enriched SNPs were also found to act as population-specific eQTLs with regulatory effects on that were specific to the European populations. Analogous patterns of ancestry-specific SNP enrichment and gene regulatory control were found for genes involved in cytokine-receptor interactions, hematopoietic cell development, and cell-cell immunomodulatory interactions.   \nAncestry-specific effects on gene expression. These results give an indication of how ancestry-enriched SNPs can impact health-related phenotypes by virtue of their gene regulatory effects. SNP-by-ancestry interactions were characterized using an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach. Examples of   a   African-specific and   b   European-specific eQTL are shown along with   c   eQTL shared between populations.   d   eQTL related to immune system and infectious disease found in the African and European populations are shown in a CIRCOS plot with links indicated between eQTLs and their regulated genes.   e   Examples of immune-related pathways that include multiple eQTL-regulated genes for African and/or European populations \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nLatin America has a unique genetic heritage with high levels of admixture from African, European, and Native American ancestral source populations [ \u2013 ]. As such, the genome sequences of Latinos contain combinations of ancestry-specific genetic variants that never previously existed in the same genomic background. In other words, Latin American genomes represent a very recent evolutionary innovation in the long trajectory of human evolution and migration around the globe. Accordingly, the development and application of genomic approaches to healthcare in Latin America will require a deep understanding of the genetic ancestry and admixture profiles of Latin American populations. This issue is particularly pressing given the fact that the vast majority of studies aimed at uncovering genetic variants associated with health- and disease-related phenotypes have been conducted in populations with European ancestry [ ,  ]. \n\nHere, we have tried to address this issue by relating patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture to health and disease determinants in Latin American genomes. To do so, we developed and applied a novel SNP-based approach to ancestry enrichment analysis. Our approach leverages information on the genetic ancestry of the modern Latin American populations to discover SNP variants that exist in a given population at higher frequencies than expected, i.e. ancestry-enriched SNPs. We found that specific sets of ancestry-enriched genetic variants, from each of the three ancestral source populations, have been preferentially retained in modern Latin American populations based on a variety of roles that they play in health and fitness. These findings have relevance for the development of genomic approaches to healthcare, i.e. personalized or precision medicine, in Latin America. \n\nGene set enrichment analysis uncovered a number of immunity, metabolism, and disease-related pathways that are significantly overrepresented with respect to genes that contain ancestry-enriched SNPs (Figs.\u00a0  and  ). These results suggest that these particular pathways, and their related phenotypes, could underlie population-specific health disparities in the four admixed Latin American populations studied here. They also give an indication that populations with particular ancestry profiles may be more or less disposed to some of these diseases and phenotypes; information of this kind could ultimately help to guide targeted health interventions. As these results represent basic research into the relationship between genetic ancestry and determinants of health, more clinically facing (translational) research will need to be done in order to precisely define the role of individual ancestry-enriched variants in disease etiology, prevention and treatment. \n\nExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis revealed ancestry-enriched SNPs in modern Latin American populations that are associated with African- or European-specific patterns of gene regulation (Fig.  ). This includes SNPs that are associated with ancestry-specific regulation of genes involved in both the innate and adaptive immune systems as well as targeted infectious disease responses. These results underscore the relevance of gene regulatory control as an underlying driver of adaptive introgression in admixed populations. \n\nOne important caveat with respect to the interpretation of the results that we report is that they can only be taken to apply to the four specific populations analyzed here: Colombian in Medellin, Colombia (CLM), Mexican Ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MXL), Peruvian in Lima, Peru (PEL), and Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico (PUR). Given the diversity of Latin American populations, and in particular their distinct ancestry profiles, we should expect to see distinct ancestry enrichments for different countries in the region, such as Argentina, Chile, Brazil etc. This caveat not only applies to different countries but also applies to different populations within the same country. Colombia, for instance, is an extremely diverse country with populations from different regions that show very distinct ancestry profiles [ ]. The population of Colombia analyzed here is from Medell\u00edn in the state of Antioquia, and this particular population shows averages of 64% European ancestry, 29% Native American ancestry, and 7% African ancestry. However, we have previously shown that the population from the neighboring state of Choc\u00f3 has a totally distinct ancestry profile with 76% African ancestry, 13% European ancestry, and 11% Native American ancestry [ \u2013 ]. Accordingly, results from the analysis of the population from Medell\u00edn cannot be taken to represent the entire country of Colombia. Clearly, a deeper understanding of the relationship between genetic ancestry and health determinants in Latin America will require analysis of many more populations within and between the region\u2019s countries. \n\n\n## Additional files \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6288849, "text_md5": "c2f63953aaf1a83d23915e3b56f0e046", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 156], "journal": [157, 169], "publication_year": [171, 175], "title": [186, 254], "keywords": [268, 387], "abstract": [400, 3063], "body": [3072, 38824]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30537949, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-018-5195-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288849", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6288849"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288849\">6288849</a>", "list_title": "PMC6288849  Genetic ancestry, admixture and health determinants in Latin America"}

However, a direct role for TSLP in CD8  T-cell primary responses remains controversial and its role in memory CD8  T cell responses to secondary viral infection is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of TSLP in both primary and recall responses in mice using two different viral systems. Interestingly, TSLP limited the primary CD8  T-cell response to influenza but did not affect T cell function nor significantly alter the number of memory CD8  T cells generated after influenza infection. However, TSLP inhibited memory CD8  T-cell responses to secondary viral infection with influenza or acute systemic LCMV infection. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TSLP on recall CD8  T-cell responses in response to viral infection, findings with potential translational implications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInfluenza virus infection accounts for significant morbidity and mortality ( ;  ), and understanding factors controlling the immune response to influenza is important for developing strategies for enhancing immunity and designing new therapies and vaccines. The absence of CD8  T cells delays influenza clearance ( ), demonstrating the importance of these cells in the control of infection by this virus. The main cellular targets of influenza are pulmonary epithelial cells, which once infected produce multiple inflammatory mediators that can alter the immune response to influenza infection. One of these mediators is TSLP, a pleiotropic cytokine with a range of actions, affecting cellular maturation, survival, and recruitment of cells. Although TSLP was initially reported to act on T cells indirectly through dendritic cells ( ;  ), it was later shown to also act directly on both mouse and human CD4  and CD8  T cells ( ;  ;  ;  ). TSLP has additional effects on B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils ( ;  ;  ). TSLP signals via a receptor comprising a TSLP-specific binding protein, TSLPR, and the IL-7 receptor \u03b1 chain, IL-7R\u03b1 (CD127), thereby activating JAK1, JAK2, and STAT5 ( ). TSLP is expressed at barrier surfaces, and has been extensively studied in the context of T helper 2 (T 2) type responses and shown to promote the progression of T 2-mediated diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic inflammation ( ;  ;  ;  ), as well as immune responses to the intestinal pathogen,   Trichuris muris   ( ), but the role of TSLP on CD8 T-cell responses is less-well characterized. There are conflicting reports of the role of TSLP on CD8  T cells during primary influenza infection ( ;  ;  ), and the effects of TSLP on memory CD8  T cells and secondary responses to acute viral infections have not been characterized. Here, we used an adoptive co-transfer model of WT and TSLPR-deficient mice (the gene encoding TSLPR is the   Crlf2   gene, so these mice are designated as   Crlf2 )   virus-specific CD8  T cells to analyze the direct actions of TSLP on CD8  T cells during both primary and secondary responses to influenza virus infection, as well as the role of this cytokine in na\u00efve and memory CD8 \u00a0T-cell homeostasis. We also assessed the role of TSLP in the context of an acute systemic infection caused by LCMV. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### TSLP acts directly on CD8  T cells during primary influenza infection \n  \nTo assess the role of TSLP on CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during influenza infection, we adoptively transferred P14 T cells (TCR transgenic CD8  T cells specific for LCMV glycoprotein 33, gp33) into WT mice. We then infected these mice intranasally one day later with influenza strain PR8-33, which represents the PR8 strain genetically modified to express gp33 ( ), and then examined TSLPR expression over time in lungs and spleen (see schematic, upper part of  ). TSLPR was expressed on na\u00efve (CD44 ) CD8  T cells, with high expression on virus-specific CD8  T\u00a0cells in both the lungs and spleen by day six post-infection ( ), with a subsequent decrease evident at days 14 and 33 ( ), suggesting that TSLP might directly act on virus-specific CD8  T cells, and indeed increased   Tslp   mRNA expression has been observed during influenza infection ( ;  ). \n   TSLP acts directly on CD8  T cells during primary influenza infection.  \n(  A  ) TSLPR expression on influenza-specific CD8  T cells (P14 tg) during primary influenza infection.

(see schematic in  , upper panel and transferred cells lower panel). TSLPR was highly expressed on the virus-specific WT CD8  T cells but not   Crlf2   cells in all tissues assessed at day 8 p.i.: lungs, mediastinal (draining) lymph node, spleen, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, with highest expression seen in the BAL fluid ( ). At day 8 p.i., there was a modest increase in   Crlf2   T cells compared to WT cells in the lungs, mediastinal lymph node, and spleen, but not in BAL fluid (  and  ); the results were qualitatively similar when the experiment was performed using Th1.1 /Thy1.1  WT P14T cells and Thy1.1 /Thy1.2  Crlf2  cells ( ) or with Th1.1 /Thy1.2  WT P14T cells and Thy1.1 /Thy1.1  Crlf2   cells ( ), with composite results shown in ( ). Thus, the difference was due to WT versus   Crlf2   differences rather than differences that might exist between Thy1.1 /Thy1.1  and Thy1.1 /Thy1.2  genetic backgrounds. Some variation in the expression of CD44 ( ) and KLRG1 ( ) was observed, but the differences were modest, and there were similar levels of granzyme B ( ) and percentages of WT and   Crlf2   cells expressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, or both cytokines after ex-vivo stimulation with cognate peptide (GP33) ( ). Because TSLP signals via a dimer of the TSLP-specific receptor chain (TSLPR) and IL-7R\u03b1, we considered the possibility that the absence of TSLPR leads to the compensatory induction of IL-7R\u03b1 (CD127), which might result in an IL-7-dependent increase in the number of   Crlf2   cells, but expression of IL-7R\u03b1 was similar in WT and   Crlf2   cells ( ). The increased cellularity in lungs, lymph node, and spleen ( ) indicated that TSLP negatively regulates CD8  T cell effector responses during acute pulmonary influenza infection; however, the proportions of WT and   Crlf2   memory CD8  T cells were not significantly different during the memory phase in lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, and BAL fluid ( ). \n\n\n### TSLP affects homeostasis of na\u00efve but not memory CD8  T cells \n  \nTSLP has been shown to play a direct role in the survival and homeostasis of na\u00efve CD8  T cells both in vivo and in vitro, inducing enhanced BCL-2 expression and higher proliferation, with decreased apoptosis in na\u00efve CD8  T cells in vitro and higher survival/homeostasis of these cells after cell transfer into na\u00efve hosts ( ). We therefore investigated whether TSLP could enhance memory CD8 \u00a0T-cell survival/homeostasis. We isolated P14 CD8  T cells from the spleens of na\u00efve P14 mice or from the spleens of mice that were seeded with na\u00efve P14 T cells and then infected with PR8-33 virus for more than 30 days to create memory P14 T cells. When na\u00efve P14 T cells were cultured without anti-CD3 + anti-CD28, cell survival was\u00a0>90% at 4 hr in the absence or presence of TSLP ( , 1st and 2nd lanes). Survival was lower at 24 hr in medium, but TSLP significantly enhanced the survival ( , 3rd and 4th lanes). However, when analogous cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28, basal survival was higher and TSLP no longer further increased survival ( , last two lanes). When we performed the same analysis on memory CD8  T cells, cell survival was also lower at 24 than at 4 hr, without a statistically significant effect of TSLP ( ). We next examined the role of TSLP in na\u00efve and memory CD8 \u00a0T-cell homeostasis in vivo. We co-transferred equal numbers of congenically marked WT and   Crlf2   na\u00efve P14 cells into WT mice ( ) and found fewer   Crlf2   than WT cells at days 9\u201311 post-transfer ( , left panels), consistent with a previous study that suggested that TSLP is important for na\u00efve CD8 \u00a0T-cell homeostasis ( ). In contrast, both WT and   Crlf2   P14 memory CD8 \u00a0T cells persisted similarly following transfer into na\u00efve hosts ( , right panels). \n   TSLP affects homeostasis of na\u00efve but not memory CD8  T cells.  \n(  A and B  ) (  A  ) Na\u00efve P14 CD8  T cells were purified and plated with either media or TSLP with or without plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. Cell viability was assessed by gating on CD8  T cells and live/dead staining after 4 and 24 hr. (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Data are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. (  B  ) Memory P14 CD8  T cells were purified and plated with either media or TSLP with or without soluble anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. Cell viability was assessed by gating on CD8  T cells and live/dead staining after 4 and 24 hr. (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Data are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. (  C  ) Na\u00efve P14 CD8  T cells were purified and equal numbers of WT (Thy1.1 /1.1 ) and   Crlf2   (Thy1.1 /1.2 ) P14 CD8  T cells were co-transferred into na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice (Thy1.2 /1.2 ). Shown are representative flow cytometry plots (gated on live Thy1.1  CD8  cells) of the combined na\u00efve WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells pre-transfer.

For A, B and D: Data are mean \u00b1 SEM. ns = not significant; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ****p<0.0001 using a two-tailed paired students t-test. Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. \n  \n\n### TSLP affects gene expression in na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells in vitro \n  \nGiven the differential impact of TSLP on na\u00efve versus memory CD8  T cells, we sought to elucidate the mechanism and performed RNA-sequencing analysis on na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells stimulated in vitro with or without TSLP and in the absence (  and  ) or presence (  and  ) of TCR stimulation. The gating strategy for the memory CD8  T cells is shown in  . As expected, TSLP treatment of na\u00efve cells and memory cells resulted in a number of genes up- or down-regulated in each treatment group. There were more down-regulated than up-regulated genes with TSLP except at the 4 hr time point without TCR activation, suggesting that TSLP was a mediator of gene repression. In na\u00efve cells, the number of upregulated genes was lower at 24 than at 4 hr, independent of TCR stimulation, but in memory cells, the number of upregulated genes was higher at 24 than at 4 hr ( ), again indicating differences in the effect of this cytokine on na\u00efve and memory T cells. We analyzed the genes in na\u00efve versus memory CD8  T cells without TCR stimulation at 24 hr (overlap is shown in the Venn diagram in  ; list of genes in  ), and found that only a few genes were shared between na\u00efve cells and memory cells, indicating distinctive effects of TSLP on these different cell types. Ten genes including   Alcam  ,   Nfil3, Bcat1  ,   Olfr613  ,   Nr4a2, Bloc1s3  ,   Zfp488  ,   Cpox  ,   Zfp457  , and   Ap1s3   were down-regulated in both na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells ( , genes in blue in  ), whereas five genes including   Bcl2  ,   Pole2, Socs3  ,   Nek6,   and   Tfrc   were up-regulated in both cell types ( ; genes in red in  ). Up-regulation of   Bcl2   is consistent with higher cell viability after TSLP stimulation in vitro ( ). Interestingly, seven genes were down-regulated in na\u00efve CD8  T cells but up-regulated in memory CD8  T cells (  Hspa1b, Gadd45g  ,   H2-ab1  ,   Isg15, Socs2, Fcer1g  , and   Sfxn2  ) (genes in black in  ), consistent with some potentially opposing/distinctive actions for TSLP in na\u00efve versus memory CD8  T cells. Moreover, there were a number of genes significantly up- or down- regulated by TSLP in memory cells relative to na\u00efve cells (  and  ). One of the induced genes,   Hk2  , encodes a key rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, a process that is active in effector T cells and promotes T cell proliferation ( ;  ). Three of the genes whose expression was diminished by TSLP were   Runx2, Egr2  , and   Panx1  . RUNX2 is a transcription factor that promotes long-term persistence of antiviral CD8  memory T cells ( ), EGR2 is critical for normal differentiation of na\u00efve T cells and for regulating antigen-specific immune responses to influenza viral infection ( ), and PANX1 was reported to influence memory T\u00a0cell maintenance ( ), collectively indicating that there are distinctive effects of TSLP on na\u00efve and memory T cells. The potential role(s) of these genes during influenza infection remains to be further elucidated. \n   TSLP modulates gene expression on na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells in vitro.  \nRNA-Seq performed on sorted na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells after 4 or 24 hr incubation with medium or TSLP with or without TCR stimulation. Shown are the number of differentially expressed genes (FC\u00a0>1.5, FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05). (  A and B  ) Number of genes affected by TSLP in CD8  T cells not stimulated (  A  ) or stimulated (  B  ) with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28. (  C  ) Venn diagram showing the number of genes whose expression was upregulated or downregulated by TSLP without TCR stimulation at 24 hr of incubation in na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells. (  D  ) Genes regulated by TSLP both in na\u00efve and memory CD8  T cells, color-coded as indicated in the text. (  E  ) Genes differentially regulated by TSLP in na\u00efve vs. memory cells. Highlighted are those that were selectively induced or repressed after stimulation with TSLP for 24 hr. \n \n   Gating strategy for sorting memory CD8  T cells for in vitro stimulation.  \nShown is forward versus side scatter (FSC versus SSC) to exclude debris (first plot), then FSC-A and FSC-H analysis as well as SSC-H and SCC-W were performed to exclude doublets (second and third plots). Then dead cells were eliminated (fourth plot). Transferred P14 cells were identified as CD8  Thy1.1  cells (fifth plot). \n  \n \n\n### TSLP has a direct inhibitory effect on secondary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during influenza infection \n  \nTo further understand the biological consequences of TSLP on memory cells, we next co-transferred equal numbers of congenically marked WT and   Crlf2   memory P14 cells (>30 days after influenza infection) into na\u00efve WT mice and infected these mice with PR8-33 intranasally the following day (schematic in  , left; CD44 expression on WT and   Crlf2   memory P14 cells and ratio of transferred cells  , right panels). On day 8 p.i., virus-specific secondary effector CD8  T cells in BAL fluid, lungs, lymph nodes, and spleen expressed high levels of TSLPR ( ). There tended to be higher expression than observed on primary effector CD8  T cells at day 8 p.i. ( ), but the highest TSLPR expression was still observed on BAL fluid cells ( ). When we assessed the secondary effector P14 responses on day 8 p.i., effector P14 T\u00a0cells were present in all tissues, with a markedly increased proportion of   Crlf2   P14 T cells in lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, and BAL fluid ( ). These data demonstrate that TSLP constrains secondary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during influenza infection. However, the percentage of cells expressing both IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 was similar in WT and   Crlf2   mice after ex-vivo stimulation with cognate peptide (GP33), with only modest differences in the percentage of cells producing only IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1 alone ( ). \n   TSLP has a direct inhibitory effect on secondary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during influenza infection.  \n(  A  ) Left panel, experimental design for (  B\u2013G  ), where P14 T cells were isolated from P14 WT (Thy1.1 /1.1 ) and P14   Crlf2   (Thy1.1 /1.2 ) mice and then separately injected into na\u00efve WT mice. Each mouse was then infected with influenza PR8-33 i.n. for\u00a0>30 days, and WT P14 cells and   Crlf2   P14 cells were separately isolated. These cells were all CD44  (right upper panel); 10  cells from each type of mouse were then co-transferred into recipient na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice (Thy1.2 /1.2 ) on day \u22121, and similar numbers of WT P14 cells and   Crlf2   P14 cells were present (right lower panel). On the following day (day 0), each mouse was infected with 10  EID  of PR8-33 i.n. (  B\u2013D  ) Mice were analyzed at day 8 p.i. (  B  ) The expression of TSLPR on CD8  T cells in BAL fluid, lungs, lymph node, and spleen.

(  G  ) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes from WT or   Crlf2   CD8 T\u00a0cells\u00a0at day 8 p.i. with secondary influenza infection. Shown is the scale for fold induction or repression.

Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. \n \n   IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 expression in WT versus   Crlf2  mice during secondary infection.  \nCells were re-stimulated with gp33 peptide in the presence of monensin and brefeldin A for 5 hr, and production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 was assessed by flow cytometry. (  A\u2013C  ) Shown are the percentage of cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 (  A  ), TNF-\u03b1 (  B  ), or both cytokines (  C  ). (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM. ns = not significant; *p<0.05; **p<0.01 using a two-tailed paired students t-test. Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. \n  \n\n   Gating strategy for sorting WT and   Crlf2  CD8  T cells for RNA-sequencing.  \nShown is forward versus side scatter (FSC versus SSC) to exclude debris (first plot), then FSC-A and FSC-H analysis was performed to exclude doublets (second plot). Then dead cells were eliminated (third plot). An empty channel was used to eliminate autofluorescent cells such as macrophages. Transferred P14 cells were identified as CD8  Thy1.1  cells (fourth plot) and then   Crlf2   cells as Thy1.1 Thy1.2  cells and WT cells as Thy1.1 Thy1.2  cells. \n  \n \nWe next assessed the effects of TSLP signaling on CD8 \u00a0T-cell recall responses at day 8 after secondary infection by RNA-Seq. The gating strategy for WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells is shown in  . Compared with WT cells, 20 genes were induced and nine genes were repressed in   Crlf2   cells (  and  ); we confirmed that   Crlf2   gene expression was absent in   Crlf2   cells ( ). Two genes whose expression was markedly increased were   Eps8l1   (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8-like 1) and   Eaf2. Eps8l1   has been reported to upregulate cell cycle genes, induce chemokines and enhance migration of some cancer cells ( ;  ;  ), whereas   Eaf2   acts as an upstream modulator of non-canonical Wnt signaling, and has been suggested to suppress oxidative stress\u2013induced apoptosis through inhibition of caspase 3 production and activation of Wnt3a signaling ( ). By enhancing migration and decreasing apoptosis the upregulation of these genes may help to explain the greater numbers of   Crlf2   cells we observed in the recall CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses ( ). Several   Ifitm   (interferon induced transmembrane) family members were also more highly expressed in   Crlf2   cells (  and  ). These proteins confer cellular resistance to many viruses in both mice and humans ( ;  ;  ), and IFITM3 is known to contribute to the control of influenza A virus ( ). Thus, the induction of   Ifitm   family genes might protect cells, limiting cell death after viral infection and leading to greater numbers of   Crlf2   cells after secondary infection, helping to explain the negative effect of TSLP on the expansion of CD8  T cells in response to influenza virus infection. \n\n\n### TSLP affects virus-specific CD8  T cell\u00a0responses during primary and recall LCMV infection \n  \nWe next investigated whether the effects of TSLP on primary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses that we observed with influenza (where infection is at a barrier surface where TSLP is expressed) might extend to a systemic infection such as acute LCMV infection. Using the same adoptive co-transfer method of WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells ( ) that we used for influenza infection ( ), we found that virus-specific P14 CD8  T cells expressed more TSLPR at day 8 after LCMV infection in all tissues analyzed (blood, lungs, lymph node, and spleen) ( ), analogous to what we observed after influenza infection in lungs, lymph node, spleen, and BAL fluid ( ). Moreover, TSLP protein was also increased in the lungs at day 8 after LCMV infection ( ). At day 8 p.i. with LCMV, WT, and   Crlf2   P14 T\u00a0cell numbers were similar in most tissues examined, but   Crlf2   cells were modestly more abundant in the spleen ( ). At a memory time point, CD8  T cells also expressed TSLPR ( ), with more   Crlf2   than WT P14 cells in the blood and lymph nodes of mice ( ), indicating that TSLP influences CD8  memory T\u00a0cell numbers in at least some tissues after acute LCMV infection. \n   Direct actions of TSLP on virus-specific CD8  T cells during primary and recall LCMV infection.  \n(  A  ) Schematic of LCMV infection experiment. 10  of WT (Thy1.1 /1.1 ) and   Crlf2   (Thy1.1 /1.2 ) P14 na\u00efve T cells were co-transferred into na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice (Thy1.2 /1.2 ) and on the following day the mice were infected i.p. with 2 \u00d7 10  pfu of LCMV Armstrong. Mice were analyzed at day 8 p.i. (  B and C  ) or at a memory time point (>day 30 p.i.) (  D and E  ). (  B  ) TSLPR expression was assessed on LCMV-specific P14 CD8  T cells in the tissues on day 8 p.i. (  C  ) Proportion of WT and   Crlf2   T cells at day 8 p.i. in the tissues (combined data from two independent experiments shown). (  D  ) TSLPR expression on memory P14 T cells from a mouse seeded with P14 T cells and infected with LCMV Armstrong i.p. for\u00a0>30 days. (  E  ) The proportion of WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells of transferred cells in the tissues at\u00a0>30 days, a memory time point (combined data from two independent experiments shown). (  F  ) Schematic of LCMV infection experiment. WT (Thy1.1 /1.1 ) and   Crlf2   (Thy1.1 /1.2 ) P14 T cells were isolated from mice seeded with P14 T cells and infected with LCMV Armstrong i.p. for\u00a0>30 days, and equal numbers of WT and   Crlf2   cells (10  of each population) were co-transferred into na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice (Thy1.2 /1.2 ) on day \u22121. On the following day (day 0), the mice were infected with 2 \u00d7 10  pfu LCMV Armstrong i.p. Mice were analyzed at day 8 p.i. (  G  ) Proportion of WT and   Crlf2   T cells at day 8 p.i. with LCMV in the tissues, (combined data from two independent experiments shown). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM. ns = not significant; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ****p<0.0001 using a two-tailed paired students t-test. Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. \n \n   TSLP protein expression during acute LCMV infection.    \n \nTo determine if TSLP also limited the secondary response to an acute systemic infection, analogous to what we observed with influenza infection, we next adoptively transferred equal numbers of LCMV memory WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells into na\u00efve mice and infected these mice with LCMV Armstrong intraperitoneally ( ). At day 8 p.i., there were more   Crlf2   secondary effector P14 T cells than corresponding WT effector P14 T cells in blood, lungs, inguinal lymph nodes, and spleen, with   Crlf2   P14 T cells making up greater than 60% of the P14 population ( ). Thus, TSLP negatively regulated the secondary CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell response to either an acute local lung infection (influenza) or an acute systemic infection (LCMV), revealing a previously unappreciated role for TSLP in directly modulating memory CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell recall responses. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTSLP has been studied extensively in the context of T 2-type immunity, and we previously demonstrated that TSLP can act directly on CD4  and CD8  T cells, but its roles in CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses during viral infection remain poorly understood. Although TSLP is induced by viral infection of CD8  T cells, there have been conflicting reports regarding its actions on CD8  T cells during the primary response to influenza infection. One study using   Crlf2   mice indicated that TSLP does not affect\u00a0the\u00a0control of\u00a0influenza infection nor affect virus-specific CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses during primary infection ( ). Another report concluded that TSLP enhances CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during primary influenza infection, but that this was not due to a direct action on CD8  T cells and instead was an indirect effect on CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses resulting from TSLP-induced IL-15 production by dendritic cells ( ). Finally, a third study used an adoptive co-transfer model of WT and   Crlf2   TCR transgenic ovalbumin-specific CD8  T cells (OT-I cells) and found that after infection with an OVA-expressing influenza virus, there were fewer   Crlf2   OT I cells during the primary infection, indicating that TSLP enhances primary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses ( ). Thus, the reported roles of TSLP in CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses during primary influenza infection have been somewhat variable, possibly at least in part due to variability in the experimental models/design/animal facilities. Here, we found that TSLP acts directly on CD8  T cells to limit their responses in most tissues during primary influenza infection, with more virus-specific   Crlf2   cells than virus-specific WT cells. We additionally show that after acute systemic infection with LCMV Armstrong virus, TSLP had a modest effect on primary CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses, with only a slight increase in   Crlf2   cells in the spleen at day 8 p.i. Thus, TSLP can limit CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses during primary viral infections, but the effect varied based on the tissue assessed and the type of viral infection. The apparent differences in the various studies of TSLP\u2019s impact on CD8  T cells during primary influenza infection may be due at least in part to the tissues sampled (e.g.,   only assessed responses in BAL fluid). Additionally, the use of influenza viruses with differing pathogenicity in mice might affect the results, as   used a strain of influenza, x31, which is less pathogenic than the PR8 strain that we used. Overall, the effect of TSLP on CD8  T cells during the effector phase of a primary acute infection may vary according to the viral infection and tissues analyzed, but our data support the potential for an inhibitory effect by TSLP. \n\nKnowledge of the action of TSLP on memory CD8 \u00a0T-cell responses has been limited.\u00a0We found that TSLP does not affect the development/maintenance of memory CD8  T cells after primary influenza infection. In contrast, however, we observed differences after systemic acute LCMV infection, with increased   Crlf2   virus-specific cells in the blood and lymph nodes at a memory time point post-infection. Importantly, TSLP limited memory CD8  T cell recall responses, with enhanced cellular responses in multiple tissues of   Crlf2   T cells following either secondary influenza infection or LCMV systemic infection. Interestingly, RNA-Seq data indicated that TSLP suppresses several genes that are related to cell cycle, apoptosis, or protection from virus in influenza infection, with an increased number of virus-specific   Crlf2   CD8  T cells. \n\nThus, while TSLP appears to have variable direct effects on primary CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses, possibly depending on the context of infection, here we reveal that TSLP differentially affects na\u00efve and memory cell homeostasis. TSLP enhances na\u00efve CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell survival in vitro and homeostasis in vivo, but memory CD8  T cell\u00a0responses are negatively controlled by TSLP, highlighting a key difference between the two cell types. We also found that TSLP uniformly diminished the CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses to secondary acute viral infection in all tissues examined in both pulmonary influenza infection and acute LCMV systemic infection, underscoring a greater effect for TSLP on secondary CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell responses than primary responses. These findings have potential implications for better controlling secondary responses to viral infection. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Mice \n  \nSix to ten week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. P14 TCR transgenic mice were provided by Dr. Dorian McGavern (NINDS/NIH) and were bred to C57BL/6 Thy1.1  congenic mice from Jackson Laboratories (B6.PL-Thy1 /CyJ) and with   Crlf2   mice ( ) in our facility to create congenically-labeled WT and   Crlf2   P14 mice. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood or the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Animal Care and Use Committee and followed National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of animals in intramural research. \n\n\n### Viruses \n  \nRecombinant influenza virus expressing the LCMV gp33-41 epitope (KAVYNFATM) inserted into the NA of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8-33) was kindly provided by Dr. Rafi Ahmed (Emory University) ( ). \n\n\n### Cell transfer and viral infection \n  \nNa\u00efve WT and   Crlf2   P14 T cells were isolated for use in vitro and in vivo from the spleens of na\u00efve WT and   Crlf2   P14 mice and purified using a negative selection CD8 \u00a0T-\u00a0cell kit (Stem Cell Technologies). To generate memory CD8  T cells for use in vivo or in vitro, 5 \u00d7 10  (influenza infections) or 10  (LCMV infections) WT or   Crlf2   na\u00efve P14 cells were injected i.v. into na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice, and the following day the mice were infected with either 10  EID  of PR8-33 i.n. or 2 \u00d7 10  pfu LCMV Armstrong i.p. At\u00a0>30 days p.i. the spleens were harvested and memory WT and   Crlf2   P14 cells purified using a negative selection CD8 \u00a0T\u00a0cell kit (Stem Cell Technologies). A sample of the cells were stained with Thy1.1, Thy1.2, CD8, CD44, V\u03b12, and Live/Dead stain to determine the number of P14 T cells. Equal numbers of na\u00efve or memory WT and   Crlf2   P14 were combined; verification that equal numbers of WT and   Crlf2   were added was determined by flow cytometry using the same antibodies listed above, and 2.5 \u00d7 10  (influenza) or 10  (LCMV) naive P14 T cells or 10  (influenza) or 10  (LMCV) memory P14 T cells of each population (WT and   Crlf2  ) were co-transferred i.v. into naive C57BL/6 mice. On the day following cell transfer, the mice were infected with either 10  EID  of PR8-33 i.n. or 2 \u00d7 10  pfu LCMV Armstrong i.p. For the assessment of the homeostasis of na\u00efve and memory P14 cells in vivo, equal numbers of na\u00efve or memory WT and   Crlf2   P14 T cells (~1\u20132\u00d710  total cells) were co-transferred into na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice in  . \n\n\n### Lymphocyte isolation \n  \nLymphocytes were isolated from tissues as previously described\u00a0( ),\u00a0with some modifications. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the airways was performed with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA prior to perfusion of the lungs with PBS. Lungs were treated with 1 mg/ml Collagenase plus 1 mg/ml DNase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 3 ml of RPMI for 45 min at 37\u00b0 C. Single cell suspensions were obtained by pushing digested lungs, spleens, and lymph nodes through 40 \u03bcM mesh screens (BD Biosciences).

Its association with poor survival in several cancers implicates CtBP as a promising target for pharmacological intervention. We employed computer-assisted drug design to search for CtBP inhibitors, using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and docking. Functional screening of these drugs identified 4 compounds with low toxicity and high water solubility. Micro molar concentrations of these CtBP inhibitors produces significant de-repression of epigenetically silenced pro-epithelial genes, preferentially in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. This epigenetic reprogramming occurs through eviction of CtBP from gene promoters; disrupted recruitment of chromatin-modifying protein complexes containing LSD1, and HDAC1; and re-wiring of activating histone marks at targeted genes. In functional assays, CtBP inhibition disrupts CtBP dimerization, decreases cell migration, abolishes cellular invasion, and improves DNA repair. Combinatorial use of CtBP inhibitors with the LSD1 inhibitor pargyline has synergistic influence. Finally, integrated correlation of gene expression in breast cancer patients with nuclear levels of CtBP1 and LSD1, reveals new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. These findings implicate a broad role for this class of compounds in strategies for epigenetically targeted therapeutic intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) was first described as a phosphoprotein that binds specifically to the C-terminal end of the E1a adenovirus oncogene . These proteins were later found to represent a dimeric family of proteins, composed of CtBP1 and CtBP2, that can homodimerize or heterodimerize in the nucleus to influence multiple different epigenetic nuclear events by recruiting a diverse array of chromatin-modifying complexes . Binding partners for CtBP include histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and histone demethylases in addition to several different classes of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and chromatin-associated complexes . Therefore, in its dimeric form, CtBP has the broad potential of re-shaping the landscape of epigenetic regulation throughout the nucleus . CtBP belongs to a family of NAD-dependent D-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases including   E. Coli   D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, bacterial D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and D-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase . Though the actual substrate for CtBP remains unclear , its ability to dimerize and form higher order oligomers is positively regulated by NADH/NAD+ . The ability of CtBP to bind and undergo redox cycles with NADH/NAD+ and substrate implicates a substantial role for CtBP in the regulation of genomic responses to changes in cellular metabolism . \n\nCtBP levels are elevated in multiple different cancers to profoundly influence cellular phenotypic plasticity by promoting pathways linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, decreased genome stability and the acquisition of stem cell self-renewal features . The increasing role of epigenetic regulation in tumor heterogeneity, cellular plasticity and the acquisition of drug resistance  suggests a significant potential function for CtBP as a major determinant in the epigenetic control of cancer. These dramatic properties implicate CtBP as a promising candidate for targeted disruption by small molecule inhibitors as a therapeutic approach against cancer . The first proof of this principle was provided by the discovery that 2-Keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (MTOB), an intermediate in methionine metabolism, is a selective inhibitor of CtBP activity capable of disrupting tumor growth in murine models . However, MTOB requires 10\u2009mM concentration to be effective and is therefore considered impractical as a therapeutic agent . Recently, the crystallographic structure of the dehydrogenase domains of both CtBP2 and CtBP1 in complex with MTOB and NAD+ has been resolved . This advance provided a framework through which more effective CtBP inhibitors were designed through computational methods . Using a similar approach, 24 commercially available compounds with potential as CtBP inhibitors were identified. Four lead compounds were selected from these candidates based on their solubility, low cytotoxicity and ability to reverse transcriptional repression by CtBP. Further characterization of these compounds indicates that they have potent activity against CtBP at low micromolar concentrations to induce significant alterations in epigenetic transcriptional programming in breast cancer. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identification of small molecular inhibitors of CtBP \n  \nWe exploited the observation that most dehydrogenases have strict substrate specificities and the recent publication of the crystallographic structure of MTOB in complex with CtBP  to conduct virtual screening of the ChemNavigator iResearch Library from Sigma Aldrich  to select molecules that showed favorable interactions with three residues (His315, Glu295, Arg 266) demonstrated to function as a catalytic triad in the active site of CtBP . This computational screen identified 31 compounds of which 24 were commercially available. The docked structures of four representative compounds are shown in Fig.   and the structures of the 24 compounds identified are shown in Fig.  . These 24 compounds were then experimentally screened for influence on viability and proliferation by MTT assay (Fig.  ) and combined viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assay (Fig.  ).

The transcriptionally repressive activity of CtBP is ascribed to its ability to bind and recruit a variety of chromatin-modifying enzymes that remove activating chromatin modifications including histone 3 and 4 lysine acetylation and trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 . However, the function of CtBP is highly cell-type specific, in part due to the differential expression of various chromatin regulatory complexes and the differential abundance of proteins that destabilize and, therefore, downregulate CtBP activity including: APC, HIPK2, AMPK, and JNK1 . In breast cancer, over-expression of CtBP is associated with downregulation of a variety of pro-epithelial genes in ER+ tumors but has little effect on the expression of these genes in breast cancer cell types with more mesenchymal or stromal features . Downregulation or depletion of CtBP by RNAi-mediated gene depletion results in upregulation of pro-epithelial genes in the mesenchymal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 . We applied a functional screen for the loss of CtBP transcriptional repressive activity by screening the 24 compounds for the ability to upregulate   FOXA1   and   OVOL2  , two genes that are intimately involved in maintaining the epithelial phenotype . This functional screen identified several compounds that substantially (greater than two-fold) upregulate   FOXA1   and/or   OVOL2   expression (Fig.  ). From this screen, 4 compounds (CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24) showing both the lowest cytotoxicity, and upregulated   FOXA1   and   OVOL2   expression in MDA-MB-231, were selected (Fig.  ). All four of these compounds have molecular weights less than 300\u2009Da and are water-soluble (Fig.  ). \n\n\n### CtBP inhibitors disrupt CtBP dimerization in vivo \n  \nCtBP activity is dependent on its ability to form dimers and higher order oligomers. This property enables CtBP to recruit chromatin-modifying complexes to specific chromatin locations and stabilizes CtBP against nuclear export and degradation . As shown in Fig.  , assessment of CtBP1/CtBP2 dimerization by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor photobleaching  reveals a significant decrease in the paired CtBP1-YFP/CtBP2-CFP FRET signal, after incubation with CI19, CI22, CI23 or CI24 (Fig.  ). This is consistent with the observation that CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24 are also able to induce the release of CtBP2 from immuno-precipitated CtBP1 complexes in vitro (Supplementary Fig.  ). Finally, the dose-response for CI24 suggests the IC50 for CtBP dimerization lies between 10 and 20\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.  ).    Pharmacological Inhibition of CtBP1/CtBP2 heterodimer formation by CtBP inhibitors.  \n a   CtBP1-YFP and CtBP2-CFP heterodimerization was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor photobleaching (see Materials and methods).   b   Inhibition of CtBP dimerization FRET signal by the CtBP inhibitors CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24 at 10\u2009\u03bcM concentrations.   c   Dose-response curve of inhibition of CtBP dimerization FRET signal by increased concentrations of CI24 CtBP inhibitor.

Error bars in   c   are smaller than the size of the symbols \n  \n\n\n### Disruption of epigenetic control of transcription by CtBP small-molecule inhibition \n  \nThese four lead compounds were then screened for their specific ability to target and de-repress pro-epithelial genes that are known to be transcriptionally silenced in the mesenchymal triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 . As shown in Fig.  , analysis by CtBP chromatin immunoprecipitation, using an antibody that recognizes both CtBP1 and CtBP2 , demonstrates that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM of the CtBP inhibitor results in eviction of CtBP from the promoter regions of the master epithelial regulatory genes   OVOL2  ,   GATA3  ,   FOXA1  , and   GRHL2  , in addition to the pro-epithelial micro-RNAs, miR200c and miR203. This CtBP promoter eviction is associated with significant upregulation of the RNAs for   OVOL2  ,   GATA3  ,   FOXA1  ,   GRHL2  , miRNA   miR200c  ,   miR203  , and the well-known CtBP-repressed genes,   E-Cadherin   and   BRCA1   (Fig.  ). This gene reactivation in MDA-MB-231 is reflected by an increased level of protein expression (Fig.  , bottom). Notably, as shown in Fig.  , this drug-induced eviction occurs in the absence of appreciable loss or shift in neither total CtBP1 nor CtBP2 protein levels from the cytosolic and nuclear compartments (Fig.  , top). The relatively modest increase in both OVOL2 and FOXA1 protein levels likely reflects differential influences of both post-transcriptional (RNA stability and decay) and post-translational steps in OVOL2 and FOXA1 regulation.

For each compound, this survey demonstrates similar trends but lower levels of transcriptional reactivation by the CtBP inhibitor compounds in both MCF-7 and MCF-10A (Fig.  ). These findings indicate a cell-specific dose-sensitivity to CtBP inhibition.

These recruited assemblies then affect changes in the local epigenetic marks specific to the composition of the assembled complexes. Two classes of chromatin modifiers that have been commonly shown to associate with CtBP are the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the H3K4Me2/1 demethylase, LSD1 . LSD1 (  KDM1A  ) is a monoamine oxidase that catalyzes the removal of H3K4Me2 and K3K4Me1 activation marks by demethylation, thus disrupting the ultimate accumulation of the active H3K4Me3 modification to play a pivotal role in modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition . By ChIP analysis, the addition of the CtBP inhibitors results in significant eviction of HDAC1 from the   OVOL2  ,   FOXA1  ,   GRHL2  ,   GATA3  ,   miRNA 200c  , and   miRNA 203   promoters (Fig.  ) with a similar pattern for LSD1 ChIP (Fig.  ). Accordingly, loss of LSD1 and HDAC1 from these respective promoter regions is associated with significant increases in both histone 4 acetylation and the deposition of H3K4Me3 marks at the promoter regions of   GATA3  ,   GRHL2  ,   FOXA1  ,   OVOL2  ,   miRNA 200c  , and   miRNA 203   (Fig.  ).    Treatment with CtBP inhibitors is associated with LSD1 and HDAC1 eviction and increased deposition of activating chromatin marks at the promoter-proximal regions of pro-epithelial genes in MDA-MB-231.  \n a   qChIP profiles in MDA-MB-231 cells of HDAC1 eviction from the   GRHL2, FOXA1, OVOL2, GATA3  , miRNA 200c, and miRNA 203 proximal promoter regions following 24-h incubation with vehicle or 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors.   b   qChIP profiles of LSD1 eviction from the   GRHL2, FOXA1, OVOL2, GATA3  , miRNA 200c, and miRNA 203 proximal promoter regions following 24-h incubation with vehicle or 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors.   c   qChIP profiles of changes in histone 4 (K5,8,12,16) pan-acetylation (left) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (right) at the promoters and upstream regions of   GATA3, GRHL2, FOXA1, OVOL2  , miRNA 203, and miRNA 200c following 24-h incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors.

As shown in Fig.  , RNAi-mediated depletion of CtBP in MDA-MB-231 leads to a demonstrable decrease in cell migration, compared to empty vector control (pGIPz) as measured by a wound closure assay (right). Incubation of wild type MDA-MB-231 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors decreases cell migration throughout the time course of the wound closure assay with greater influences caused by compounds CI23 and CI24 (Fig.  , right). Similarly, at 10 micromolar concentration, all 4 compounds inhibit both invasion and migration as demonstrated in Matrigel\u00ae invasion chamber assays (Fig.  ).    Pharmacologic inhibition of CtBP decreases cellular invasion and migration and increases DNA repair in MDA-MB-231.  \n a   (Left), Relative migration at 9 and 12\u2009h of MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with doxycycline-inducible (96\u2009h) lentiviral vector expressing a shRNA that targets both CtBP1 and CtBP2 .

Prior studies have shown that depletion of CtBP results in increased DNA repair detectable in both comet and gamma H2A.X foci formation assays . In gamma H2A.X-labeled DNA repair foci assays, the addition of either CtBP inhibitors CI19, CI22, CI23, or CI24 at 10 micromolar concentrations causes increases in DNA repair as demonstrated by the significant decrease in remaining repair foci 24\u2009h following exposure to ionizing radiation (Fig.  ). Notably, the increase is comparable and, in some cases, exceeds that caused by RNAi-mediated CtBP gene depletion (Fig.  ) . \n\n\n### Synergistic pharmacological targeting of LSD1 in combination with CtBP \n  \nLSD1 was one of the first chromatin regulatory complexes to be found in association with CtBP . Several recent studies have suggested the value of targeting LSD1 in therapeutic strategies to epigenetically treat breast cancer alone or in combination with other epigenetic disruptors . The LSD1 inhibitor, pargyline has been used in the past alone or in combination with HDAC inhibitors to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in TNBC cells . Notably, the combination of these drugs were found to be more than additive for TNBCs and additive or competitive in non-TNBC cell lines . Because CtBP is a well-characterized HDAC associated component of chromatin-modifying complexes, we explored the effectiveness of combining LSD1 inhibition with CtBP inhibition as a surrogate for HDAC disruption. As shown in Fig.  , while the addition of pargyline alone minimally reactivates pro-epithelial gene expression in MDA-MB-231, its combination with CtBP inhibitors show additive to synergistic responses in the de-repression of pro-epithelial genes, particularly with respect to CI24. A comparison of the functional influences of pargyline and CI24 alone and in combination on cellular migration was profiled over time (24\u2009h) using the IncuCyte ZOOM\u2122 assay. As shown in Fig.  , while both CI24 and pargyline repress migration in this assay, their combination produces greater than additive effects. Logistic regression reveals that the combination of CI24 and pargyline have their greatest influence over time in the migration assay (Fig.  ). Using the T-statistic, the combination of Pargyline and CI24 have significantly greater than additive influence on TNBC cell migration: (  p  -value\u2009=\u20095.27 E\u221208) compared to CI24 (  p  -value\u2009=\u20090.249) or Pargyline (  p  -value\u2009=\u20090.0002) alone.

To evaluate the possible significance of high nuclear levels of CtBP and LSD1 in breast cancer survival, we utilized a unique resource of patient samples in which nuclear, CtBP1, CtBP2, and LSD1 have been quantitatively determined and compared to paired gene expression data based on RNA-seq analysis (Material and methods, also see Supplementary Fig.  ). Using this available data, 126 breast cancer patients were quantitively stratified according to CtBP1, CtBP2, and LSD1 nuclear expression into low, medium and high terciles of expression (see Materials and methods). Notably, within this cohort, the level of CtBP1 or CtBP2 did not differ greatly in patients between breast cancer subtypes or estrogen receptor status. In fact, slightly higher levels were demonstrated in estrogen-receptor-positive subtypes as opposed to estrogen receptor-negative subtypes (Supplementary Fig.  ). These categories were then used to group patients, according to their CtBP1, CtBP2 and LSD1 nuclear expression, in to three categories: (I) CtBP1/LSD1\u2009=\u2009  Low:Low  \u2009=\u2009low; (II) CtBP1:LSD1,   medium:medium  \u2009  =  \u2009medium; and (III) CtBP1/LSD1\u2009=\u2009  high:high  \u2009=\u2009high (Fig.  ). The gene expression of the patients in these three categories were then assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Fig.  ) to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the three groups. Examples of differentially expressed genes are shown by boxplot in Fig.  . Notably, many genes linked to chromatin modification and cell signaling are enriched in the genes differentially expressed in these categories (Fig.  , and Supplementary Tables  \u2013 ). Similarly, genes that are differentially expressed based on the stratification of CtBP1/CtBP2 or LSD1, respectively, were identified (Supplementary Table  ). A Venn diagram of the genes common to all three stratifications is shown in Fig.   and demonstrates very little overlap. Moreover, the gene pathways enriched in the genes differentially expressed by ANOVA of the three stratifications show significant differences (Fig.  ). CtBP1/LSD1 differentially expressed genes show significant enrichment for growth factor signaling, CtBP1/CtBP2 differential expressed genes are enriched for immune response genes including immune checkpoint regulators (Fig.  ), and LSD1 only differentially expressed genes are enriched with genes associated with regulation of the extracellular matrix (Fig.  ). Unique genes identified by ANOVA profiling of differentially expressed genes across 5 categories of CtBP1:LSD1 combinations (including CtBP1:LSD1\u2009=\u2009  Low/High   and CtBP1:LSD1\u2009=\u2009  High/Low  ) was not additionally informative (Fig.   and Supplementary Tables   and  ).

ANOVA test was applied to identify which genes differed significantly across the three categories.

The mechanisms underlying this inhibitory activity are associated with the ability of this class of compounds to disrupt the CtBP-mediated recruitment of multiple different chromatin-modifying complexes to targeted genes. These include the histone deacetylase, HDAC1; and the histone demethylase, LSD1. These findings not only implicate an important application of these compounds in strategies for therapeutic intervention but also demonstrate their utility as investigative tools to define epigenetic gene regulatory pathways and mechanisms linked to CtBP. The application of these compounds as investigative tools also provides a proof of principle for the combinatorial use of CtBP inhibitors with other epigenetically targeted compounds or therapeutic strategies. The combined use of LSD1 and CtBP inhibitors offers a new concept in this therapeutic approach. \n\nThe current rapid expansion of novel strategies to target both epigenetic regulatory enzymes and epigenetic regulatory complexes  suggests a prominent emerging new role for these compounds and other recently characterized CtBP inhibitors  in combinatorial strategies for epigenetic intervention. Although these compounds bind with modest affinity (in the micromolar range), they serve as prototypes from which to bootstrap the design of novel molecules with higher binding affinity and activity toward CtBP-regulated pathways. Similarly, although pargyline shows measurable synergy with CtBP inhibitors, its primary use in clinical trials has been associated with treatments for hypertension. Nonetheless, there is renewed interest in therapeutic targeting of LSD1 as several new compounds that disrupt LSD1 function including: GSK2879552, ORY-100, 4SC-202, IMG-7289, INCB-59872, and tranylcypromine derivatives, are being assessed in clinical trials for activity against leukemia . This is particularly relevant given the recent finding that loss of LSD1 is associated with an enhanced anti-tumor response through upregulation of double-stranded RNA stress response secondary to lost repression of endogenous retroviral elements . Furthermore, analysis of TCGA data show an inverse relationship between CD8+ T-cell infiltration and the RNA levels of LSD1 . It is not clear what underlies the cell-type specific dose sensitivity we have observed in the current study, however, this has been observed with other CtBP inhibitors . Whether or not it reflects sensitivity thresholds based on the level of epithelial differentiation in breast cancer will require extensive investigation beyond the scope of this initial proof-of-principle report. Such issues may become better resolved with the development of 2nd or 3rd generation CtBP inhibitors that act with higher affinity. Currently, the most potent compound appears to be CI24 which shows the highest uniform correlation in potency of transcriptional de-repression, with eviction of chromatin modifiers, influences on cell migration/invasion, and increase in DNA repair. The provocative finding that differential enrichment of CtBP1/LSD1 shows selective influence on ERRB2/4 signaling (Fig.  ) suggests a broader application of this targeting strategy beyond TNBC subtypes. Moreover, it suggests additional opportunities for combined therapy. An important aspect of this current study is the correlation of nuclear levels of CtBP1 and LSD1 with gene expression patterns in patient samples. Although cell lines are an easily tractable system that led to the cell-type specific identification of   GATA3  ,   FOXA1  , and   OVOL2   as major regulatory targets of CtBP, these genes do not show up as top targets in patient samples (Fig.  ). This reflects the innate heterogeneity and plasticity of patient breast cancer tissues and also is consistent with the significant cell type-specificity of the influence of CtBP inhibition, mentioned previously (Fig.  ), and observed in CtBP-depleted cell lines . Other notable correlations found in patient samples is the high significance of the DNA repair genes   ATM  ,   LIG4  ,   PARP3  ,   SETX  , and   GRF2H4   genes revealed by ANOVA analysis of the CtBP1/CTBP2 high category (see Supplementary Table  ). In summary, the findings in this study provide a new and novel conceptual groundwork for the development of more effective treatment strategies and introduce a novel class of compounds to be explored in combinatorial strategies to exploit vulnerabilities in the epigenetic regulation of breast cancer. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Cell lines and constructs \n  \nMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC. All starting cultures were screened for mycoplasma contamination approximately 4\u20135 months prior to use, and experiments were conducted on cell lines grown for no more than 13\u201315 passages. Short hairpin sequences for RNAi depletion of CtBP1 and CtBP2 were cloned into the doxycycline-inducible (Tet-ON) pINDUCER lentiviral vector system that produces a miR30-based short hairpin that targets both CtBP1 and CtBP2 . CFP-CTBP1 and YFP-CTBP2 plasmids were provided by Dr. Jermey P. Blaydes . \n\n\n### Cell culture and tissues \n  \nMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in regular DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and insulin as previously described . \n\n\n### Computer-assisted drug design \n  \nChemNavigator iResearch Library from Sigma Aldrich  was searched for molecules containing oxaldehydic acid structures similar to MTOB or structurally similar propanedioic, 3-oxobutanoic, and 4-oxopropanoic acid. These moieties can form favorable interactions with three residues (His315, Glu295, Arg 266) demonstrated to function as a catalytic triad in the active site of CtBP in addition to other essential residues at the catalytic site, including Arg266 and Arg67 . Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were generated using MTOB and a series of 11 alpha-keto acids with measured kinetic properties for the catalytic domain of CtBP. The best model obtained was then applied against the set of selected acidic compounds from ChemNavigator, and compounds with high predicted substrate activity values were filtered for drug-like properties using the Lipinski Rule . Filtered candidates selected by the QSAR modeling were then further evaluated by docking into the published crystallographic structure of the CtBP dehydrogenase core with NAD+ and acetic acid . Docking was done using Glide (27) and the docked compound structures were required to be stabilized by at least two hydrogen bonds to Arg266, Gly101 or His315 in the CtBP active site. This screen identified 31 compounds of which 24 were commercially available. (See virtual screening methods in Supplementary materials and methods) \n\n\n### Acceptor photobleaching FRET \n  \nExpression vectors for CFP-CtBP1 (pSCFP3A) and YFP-CtBP2 (pSYFP2) were co-transfected into MDA-MB-231 wild-type cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific). 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910  cells/well were seeded into Nunc Lab-Tek 8 chambered coverglass (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Cells were then treated with either 100\u2009\u03bcM of Tris control vehicle or 10\u2009\u03bcM of the four different CtBP Inhibitors (CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24). We used a plasmid encoding a CFP-YFP fusion protein with a 2-aa spacer between CFP and YFP as a positive control for FRET . Co-transfection with CFP-CtBP1 (pSCFP3A) and unconjugated YFP (pCMV6AC-mYFP) plasmids were used as negative control. Cells were imaged with a 60\u2009\u00d7\u20091.4 NA Zeiss immersion objective and \u00d72 zoom using 514\u2009nm laser line of argon laser (25\u2009mW) and 405\u2009nm laser line of Diode laser (30\u2009mW) on LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc, Thornwood, NY, USA) in the Optical Microscopy Core (NCI/CCR/LRBGE). YFP was photobleached by scanning the whole cell 10 times using the 514 laser line of an argon laser at 100% intensity. The efficiency of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) E  was measured by acceptor photobleaching method as described  based on the equation:   E   (I  \u2212 I )/I , where I ,   and I ,   referring to CFP intensities after and before YFP photobleaching, respectively. Each sample was scored for greater than 15 nuclei in order to achieve statistical significance. 15 regions of interest were randomly measured within each nucleus. A FRET signal was considered be positive if the FRET efficiency values (  E  ) obtained in the experiment exceeded those of random FRET in the negative control. \n\n\n### Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation \n  \nChIP was performed as previously described  and the list of primers and antibodies used in the study are provided in the Supplementary materials and methods. \n\n\n### Western blotting RNA isolation, and RT-qPCR \n  \nRNA isolation from cell lysates and RT-qPCR were performed as described previously  and normalized to 18S rRNA. The total RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA was quantified and 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was used for each reverse transcription. Reverse transcription was carried out by following the QuantiTect\u00ae Reverse Transcription procedure (Qiagen). For western blotting, the cells were collected and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% TritonX-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and freshly added proteinase inhibitor cocktail) for 30\u2009min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 20\u2009min at 12,000\u2009rpm and the supernatants were used for quantitation and western blotting. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described previously . \n\n\n### Invasion and migration assays \n  \nInvasion assay was performed using MDA-MB-231 cells with the Corning\u00ae Biocoat\u2122 Matrigel\u00ae Invasion Chambers (cat. 354480). Replicates were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation after 24\u2009h of treatment of Tris and 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors (CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24). After 24\u2009h of the invasion, the membranes were washed in 1X PBS, fixated in methanol, stained with DAPI, and visualized. Wound closure assay was performed using the Radius\u2122 assay from Cell Biolabs, Inc. Cells were incubated 24\u2009h with 10\u2009\u03bcM CtBP inhibitors prior to initiation of the migration assay. For assays comparing cellular migration in response to combined addition of drugs, cellular migration was measured using the IncuCyte\u00ae ZOOM System, real-time, a quantitative live-cell analysis system for high definition phase contrast images to monitor wound closer over time as directed by the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n\n### Gamma H2A.X foci formation assay \n  \nMDA-MB-231 wild type and CtBP1/2 knockdown cells were seeded in 8 chamber slides at a density of 10,000\u2009cells/well. MDA-MB-231 wild type cells were treated with the CtBP inhibitors (CI19, CI22, CI23, and CI24) and Tris Control for 24\u2009h prior to Gamma Irradiation. MDA-MB-231 wild type and CtBP1/2 knockdown cells were exposed to 5\u2009Gy of Gamma irradiation. After 0, 12, and 24\u2009h post-Gamma irradiation, cells were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min followed by 70% cold ethanol overnight. Cells were then washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, stained with anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X antibody (Ser139) (catalog # 05-636, Millipore) at 1/1000 primary antibody dilution for 1\u2009h, washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, followed by staining with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Catalog # A11001, Life Technologies) at 1/2000 dilution for one hour. Cells were then washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS followed by staining with 1/5000 DAPI dilution. Cells were then mounted with anti-fade mounting media and covered with coverslips. Different fluorescent images were taken with Axiovert 200\u2009M and only cells with 3 plus phospho-H2A foci were scored. \n\n\n### Methods for immunohistochemistry \n  \n#### Tissue microarray construction and scoring \n  \nFollowing IRB approval from East Carolina University and the National Institutes of Health Intramural research program, approximately 180 de-identified formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from patients who were diagnosed and underwent surgery for Stage 0 to Stage IV breast cancer between 2001 and 2010 at Pitt County Memorial Hospital (now Vidant Medical Center), Greenville, NC. Following a review of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, regions of interest were outlined, and 1\u2009mm cores were removed from corresponding blocks using a Pathology Devices TMArrayer (Westminster, MD). All arrays contained appropriately chosen positive and negative control tissue. Digital image analysis and scoring of IHC staining was performed using Leica Aperio digital analysis platforms, in which three representative regions of tumor were outlined on each core by a pathologist and scored digitally using the Nuclear v9 algorithm (CtBP1, CtBP2, and LSD1) to generate a histo-score (H-Score; 0\u2013300) based on the percent of positive cells with assigned intensity thresholds of negative (0), low (1), moderate (2) or high (3) as previously described . \n\nBreast tumor tissue microarrays were stained, using monoclonal primary antibodies, CTBP1 and CTBP2 (33871, 39008 Millipore) at 1:100,000 overnight with high pH (Catalog No. M361201-2, DAKO). LSD1 (Abcam, ab129195) staining was done at 1:2000 overnight with low pH (Catalog No. MA5-13191, DAKO). Using the assigned scale of 1\u2013300, patients were then classified into terciles based on the H-Scores for CtBP1, CtBP2, and LSD1, respectively. The data was then categorized into terciles based on the divided ordered distribution into three parts, each containing a third, i.e. 33.33% of a given population. The first tercile (low) represents the lowest 33.33% of the data (1\u201333.33%); the second tercile represents the medium 33.33% value (33.34\u201366.66%) and third highest 33.33 value (66.34\u2013100%). Based on those protein values, the patients were classified into these three categories and defined them as low, medium and high. Finally, patients were segregated into combined CtBP1: LSD1 categories of Low: Low; Medium: Medium; and High: High and used for comparison of their gene expression patterns. \n\n\n#### RNA-seq \n  \nFollowing a review of H&E stained slides areas of tumor with >80% nuclei were circled, and 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u20133\u2009mm tissue cores were extracted from the corresponding regions of FFPE tissue blocks for   N  \u2009=\u2009126 patients. Sample cores were shipped to BGI Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) for further processing as previously described . Briefly, the total RNA samples were first treated with DNase I, followed by an mRNA enrichment step enriched by using the oligo (dT) coupled magnetic beads. Following fragmentation, the first strand of cDNA was synthesized by using random hexamer-primers. Buffer, dNTPs, RNase H and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second strand. The double-strand cDNA was purified with magnetic beads and end reparation and 3\u2019-end single nucleotide A (adenine) addition was then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments. The fragments were enriched by PCR amplification. During the QC step, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System were used to qualify and quantify the sample library. The library was sequenced (60\u2009M paired-end read per sample) on an Illumina HiSeqTM4000. \n\n\n#### Sequence data analysis \n  \nAfter sequencing, the raw reads were filtered (BGI). Data filtering included removing adapter sequences, contamination and low-quality read from raw reads. The cleaned reads (fastQ) were mapped to the reference sequence using HISAT . Raw reads and RPKM for each sample were calculated using HOMER . Differential gene expression was performed using EdgeR . \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nA Spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the relation between its protein H-score and gene expression (RPKM value) values . A completely unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach was performed on all 486 breast samples of the protein data set. Complete linkage and distance correlations were used for clustering protein data with bootstrap resampling techniques. The stability of the clustering was estimated with the \u2018pvclust\u2019 R package  available on CRAN  ). A two-sided   t  -test was employed to test the null hypothesis (H0) assumption of equality of the protein values in two defined groups of data and demonstrated by violin plots using R software and ggplot2 package . ANOVA and logistic regression analysis were conducted using R statistical analysis software. A   p  -value thresholds 0.05 was applied to select the top significant genes (Supplementary Table  ). A reactome open-source browser (version 3.6), with curated and peer-reviewed pathway database (reactome release 67) was used for pathway analysis of the top genes identified ( ). \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6751206, "text_md5": "df8dfba1e05cb03f8d5f50fc7112b27b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 406], "journal": [407, 421], "publication_year": [423, 427], "title": [438, 534], "keywords": [548, 580], "abstract": [593, 2161], "body": [2170, 46177]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31534138, "doi": "10.1038/s41419-019-1892-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751206", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6751206"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751206\">6751206</a>", "list_title": "PMC6751206  Epigenetic re-wiring of breast cancer by pharmacological targeting of C-terminal binding protein"}

Here we identify a novel role for the Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factor Gli-Similar 3 (  Glis3  ) in male germ cell development in the mouse embryos.   Glis3   is expressed in male germ cells during the brief window of time prior to initiation of piRNA-dependent retrotransposon surveillance. Disruption of   Glis3   function led to a widespread reduction in retrotransposon silencing factors, aberrant retrotransposon expression and pronounced germ cell loss. Experimental induction of precocious   Glis3   expression   in vivo   before its normal expression resulted in premature expression of several piRNA pathway members, suggesting that GLIS3 is necessary for the activation of the retrotransposon silencing programs. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for GLIS3 in the development of male germ cells and point to a central role for GLIS3 in the control of retrotransposon silencing in the fetal germline. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGerm cells are a specialized population of cells that gives rise to gametes and, upon conception, form a continuous chain of genetic information between generations. In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified at early gastrulation, around embryonic day (E) 6.25, then undergo a rapid burst of proliferation and migration to reach the developing gonads around E10.5 . PGCs also undergo extensive epigenetic remodeling \u2013 including global DNA demethylation, chromatin reorganization, and imprint erasure - during this phase of development . These epigenetic changes are vital to reset methylation marks as the germline enters a new generation but leave PGCs vulnerable to genetic damage from transposable DNA elements. \n\nIt is imperative for germ cells to protect the integrity of their \u2018immortal\u2019 genomes and they have developed several unique mechanisms to do so, which include global transcriptional repression, chromatin state alteration and expression of germline specific PIWI/piRNA factors . Mis-regulation and defects in these mechanisms such as in mice lacking components of the PIWI/piRNA pathway, including Piwi-like 1(  Piwil1  ),   Piwil2  ,   Piwil4  ,   Vasa  ,   Dnmt3l  ,   Hormad1  ,   Prmt5   and others  led to germ cell loss and infertility. In all of these examples, germ cells are lost in postnatal life, concordant with the transition from germ cell (gonocyte) to spermatogonial stem cell. Fetal loss of male germ cells, by contrast, is not common and the mechanism(s) underlying this process are not well understood. \n\nIn this study, we set out to characterize the role of a testis-enriched transcription factor, GLIS3 , in male germ cell development in mouse embryos. GLIS3 is a member of the GLI-Similar (GLIS) family of Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factors, named for their high degree of sequence homology to the zinc finger domains of the Gli/Zic proteins .   Glis3   is highly expressed in mid-gestation kidney and pancreas and has been shown to be essential for the development of these\u00a0organs . Homozygotes of a weaker   Glis3   mutant allele (  Glis3  ) have defects in spermatogonia differentiation and proliferation during early postnatal testis development in the mouse . Testes from this hypomorphic   Glis3   mutant strain appeared normal at birth but contain little to no germ cells by 8 weeks of age. Genes associated with undifferentiated spermatogonia, including   Ret  ,   Lhx1   and   Pouf51  , were suppressed in the neonatal testis of this   Glis3   mutant line, suggesting that normal GLIS3 function is important for transition from germ cell to spermatogonial stem cell during early spermatogenesis . \n\nGiven the unique pattern of   Glis3   expression in embryonic testis, we hypothesized that it also plays an important role during fetal testis development. In this study, we analyzed the testis phenotypes in a nonfunctional   Glis3   knockout mouse and examined its role in male fetal germ cell survival and its potential involvement in retrotransposon silencing programs. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Glis3   is expressed predominantly in germ cells \n  \nThe first goal of our study was to precisely characterize the expression pattern of   Glis3   during fetal testis development. Attempts to generate specific antibodies against mouse GLIS3 have thus far been unsuccessful. We therefore turned our focus to mRNA levels using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In wild-type fetal testes,   Glis3   mRNA levels rose sharply around E12.5 and returned to baseline by E14.5 (Fig.\u00a0 ). To determine the cellular source of   Glis3   in fetal testes, we separated somatic and germ cell fractions from E13.5   Oct4-eGFP   testis, in which germ cells are marked by enhanced GFP fluorescence, by FACS (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ).   Glis3   mRNA was predominantly detected in male germ cells with low expression in the somatic cells, which is consistent with   Glis3   expression pattern described in isolated fetal germ cells at E11.5 to E13.5 (Fig.\u00a0 ) . The germ cell-specific expression of   Glis3   was further confirmed with a knock-in mouse line, in which the endogenous GLIS3 protein is fused to an enhanced GFP protein (  Glis3-eGFP  ). In E13.5 fetal testes,   Glis3-eGFP   was found predominantly in the germ cells located inside testis cords, overlapping with the germ cell marker TRA98 (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \n Glis3   is expressed in fetal germ cells in the testis.

To determine the functional significance of   Glis3  , we examined testis development from the global   Glis3   null mutation strain (  Glis3  , hereafter referred to as   Glis3   mutant) from E13.5 to postnatal day (PND) 5, the latest that mutant animals can survive.   Glis3   homozygotes develop severe pancreatic and thyroid phenotypes that cause death at or before PND7 , in contrast to the weaker   Glis3   mutant strain, which survives until approximately 2 months of\u00a0age . Gross morphological analysis revealed no overt changes in   Glis3   mutant testes at these stages of development. Morphogenesis of the testis structures and somatic cell differentiation were not affected based on the immunostaining of AMH, a marker of Sertoli cell differentiation (Fig.\u00a0 ) and expression of   Cyp11a1  , a marker for Leydig cell differentiation (Fig.\u00a0 ). At E13.5, numbers of germ cells marked with TRA98 were similar between the control and   Glis3   mutant testes, indicating that germ cell specification and migration occurred normally (Fig.\u00a0 ). However, starting at E15.5, a significant reduction in TRA98- positive germ cells became apparent in mutant testes (arrows in Fig.\u00a0 ) and by PND5, many mutant testis cords were devoid of any germ cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). At E15.5, we observed a 40% reduction in germ cell numbers in mutant testes (Fig.\u00a0 ). The decrease in germ cell numbers in mutant testes at E15.5 was in parallel with a significant reduction in expression of the germ cell-specific genes   Oct4   and   Vasa   (Fig.\u00a0 ). A similar phenotype was observed at PND5. We were not able to examine the germ cell phenotype beyond PND5 because the   Glis3   mutant animals did not survive past PND5. These results indicate that   Glis3   is highly enriched in the germ cells, and is required for germline survival in male fetal testes. Somatic cell populations were not altered in mutant testes, suggesting that germ cell loss is not a consequence of deficiencies in somatic cell differentiation.   \nFetal male germ cells are progressively lost in   Glis3   mutant testes. (  A\u2013H  ) Immunohistochemistry for the Sertoli cell marker AMH (green) and germ cell marker TRA98 (red), in wild type (WT) and   Glis3   mutant testes at E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, and PND5.

(  J  ) qPCR analysis of mRNA levels of somatic cell markers (  Sox9   for Sertoli cells and   Cyp11a   for Leydig cells) and germ cell markers (  Ddx4   and   Oct4  ) in WT and mutant testes at E15.5. Expression levels of WT samples are set as 1. Values in all graphs are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m.; N\u2009=\u20095\u20136 biological replicates per genotype (  I  ) or 3\u20134 replicates (  J  ). \n  \n\n\n### Identifying the mechanism(s) of GLIS3 action in the male germline \n  \nTo identify the mechanisms by which GLIS3 controls male germ cell survival, we performed mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on whole testes of wild type and   Glis3   mutant embryos at E14.5, before the onset of germ cell loss in mutant testes. At E14.5, germ cell numbers in the   Glis3   mutant testes (100 \u00b1 40 germ cells/mm ) were not different from those in the wild-type testes (160 \u00b1 50 vs. germ cells/mm ). GO biological process analysis of these data (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ) revealed that piRNA biosynthesis, catabolism and metabolism were the most affected processes in mutant testes. Multiple piRNA pathway components, including   Ddx4  , all three of the mammalian PIWI-like genes (  Piwil1  ,   Piwil2  , and   Piwil4  ), Maelstrom   (Mael)  , and several Tudor-domain containing genes (  Tdrd1  ,   Tdrd5  , and   Tdrd9  ) were profoundly reduced in   Glis3   mutant testes (Fig.\u00a0 ; qPCR validation of select genes shown in 3B). The germ cell specific DNA methyltransferase co-factor   Dnmt3l   was also significantly reduced in mutant testes, as was MORC family CW-type zinc finger 1   (Morc1)  , a repressor of retrotransposon activity . Individual loss of each of these genes is known to cause ectopic retrotransposon activation, meiosis prophase I germ cell arrest, and germ cell loss that appears postnatally .   \nGerm cell development pathways are selectively dysregulated in the absence of functional   Glis3  . (  A,C,E  ) Heatmaps, generated from RNA-Seq analyses, illustrate changes in several germ cell-related genes in wild-type (WT) vs.   Glis3   mutant testes at E14.5. (  A  ) downregulated genes, with reduced expression in mutant versus wild-type samples; (  C  ) genes unchanged between groups; and (  E  ) upregulated genes, with increased expression in mutant testes. Each sample column represents a pair of testes from a single embryo. Three to four biological replicates from each genotype were analyzed using Cuffdiff, resulting in differential expression of 673 unique genes (FDR adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.05). (  B,D,F  ) qPCR confirmation of genes identified by RNA-Seq. *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.005 by Student\u2019s T test.

N\u2009=\u20095\u20138 biological replicates per genotype. \n  \n\nSeveral genes implicated in spermatogenesis, including the zinc-finger motif-containing RNA-binding proteins   Nanos2   and   Nanos3   were also significantly decreased in   Glis3   mutant testes. XY germ cells from mice deficient in Nanos2 upregulate   Stimulated by retinoic acid 8   (  Stra8  ) expression and enter meiosis precociously (Tsuda   et al  . 2003, Suzuki   et al  . 2008a). Although   Stra8   mRNA was elevated in   Glis3   mutant testes (see below), STRA8 protein was not expressed at E15.5 (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that germ cell loss in   Glis3   mutants is not due to NANOS2-mediated meiotic initiation. XY germ cells from mice deficient in N  anos3   are lost via Bax-dependent apoptosis prior to colonization of the gonads (beginning E9.0) (Suzuki   et al  . 2008b).   Glis3   mutant testes did not contain any TUNEL positive cells at E15.5 (data not shown) and contained normal cell numbers at E13.5 (Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that NANOS3-mediated apoptosis is not a major contributor to the germ cell loss phenotype of   Glis3   mutant XY germ cells. Finally, several germ cell-specific genes including Boule-like RNA-binding protein (  Boll  ), HORMA domain containing 1 (  Hormad1  ), and Left-right determination factor 2 (  Lefty2  ) were unchanged in mutant testes (Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that changes in germ cell related genes (piRNA pathway components or   Nanos   genes) are not the result of general germ cell deficiency. \n\nA subset of germ cell development genes, including the meiosis related genes   Stimulated by retinoic acid 8   (  Stra8  ) and   REC8 meiotic recombination protein   (  Rec8  ) were significantly upregulated (Fig.\u00a0 ) in   Glis3   mutant testes. High levels of   Stra8   are typically found in germ cells that have initiated meiosis . To determine if   Glis3   mutant germ cells had entered meiosis precociously, we performed immunostaining for STRA8 and the meiotic synaptonemal protein complex 3 (SYCP3). Comparable to wild type testes,   Glis3   mutant testes did not contain any STRA8 or SCP3 positive cells (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that, despite ectopic expression of some meiotic genes in the absence of functional GLIS3, male germ cells do not enter meiosis. Changes in germ cell-specific gene expression were not secondary to defects in somatic cell differentiation, based on the fact that genes known to control somatic cell differentiation in the testis (for example   Amh  ,   Gata4  , and   Sox9  ) and germ cell meiosis (  Cyp26b1)   were not altered (Fig.\u00a0 ), and somatic cell morphology was normal in   Glis3   mutant testes (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results reveal an unexpected reduction in the expression of retrotransposon-silencing PIWI/piRNA pathway members and   Nanos   RNA binding factors in the absence of functional GLIS3. \n\n\n### Transposable element activation in testes lacking functional Glis3 \n  \nThe widespread reduction in expression of retrotransposon-silencing pathway components in   Glis3   mutant testes suggested a compromised function of this system, which would consequently result in increased retrotransposon mRNA expression. To determine if retrotransposon expression was affected in Glis3 deficient testes, we assessed transcriptome-wide changes in retrotransposon expression in our RNA-Seq dataset using RepeatMasker annotations. We discovered significant changes in a subset of elements from all three major retrotransposon classes: long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE), short interspersed nucleotide element (SINE), and long terminal repeats (LTR or ERV) classes (Fig.\u00a0 ). While most affected retrotransposons exhibited increased expression in mutant relative to wild-type testes (Fig.\u00a0 , ratio >1), reduced expression of several elements was also observed (Fig.\u00a0 , ratio <1). We confirmed the ectopic activation of retrotransposons known to be targets of the piRNA pathway, including the LTR intracisternal A particle (IAP) and LINE-1  using qPCR. Both transcripts were significantly elevated in   Glis3   mutant testes at E15.5, the time when germ cell numbers begin to decrease (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data indicate that one of the normal functions of GLIS3 is\u00a0to suppress expansion of select retrotransposons in the male germline immediately following the commitment of these cells to a male fate.   \n(  A  ) Relative expression of unique retrotransposon loci in   Glis3   mutant relative to WT testes at E14.5.

(  C  ) The expression of   Glis3   was ectopically and precociously induced in male germ cells of   Dppa3-creER; R26-Glis3   mice by tamoxifen administration on E10.5 and E11.5. The expression of   Glis3   mRNA and a set of retrotransposon silencing genes (  Dnmt3l  ,   Mael  ,   Tdrd1  ,   Piwil1  ,   Piwil2  , and   Piwil4  ) was analyzed in control (pale pink) and R26-Glis3\u2009+\u2009(pink) E12.5 testes using qPCR and normalized to   Gapdh  . Unpaired t-test with Welch\u2019s correction was used as a statistical test. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01. n\u2009=\u200911\u201314 per group. \n  \n\n\n### Precocious induction of retrotransposon silencing factors following ectopic   Glis3   expression \n  \nIf the normal role of GLIS3 is to promote the expression of factors necessary for retrotransposon silencing in male germ cells, then one would predict that ectopic upregulation of   Glis3   prior its normal induction should result in a premature upregulation of retrotransposon-silencing genes. In order to test this hypothesis, we generated a Rosa26 (R26)-driven Glis3 line, which allows us to induce ectopic   Glis3   expression with cell type-specific Cre recombinase (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ). By crossing the   R26-Glis3   to a tamoxifen-inducible germ cell-specific Cre recombinase line (  Dppa3-creER  ) , we produced a model that allows   Glis3   expression in germ cells after tamoxifen treatment. The increase of endogenous   Glis3   began at E12.5 (Fig.\u00a0 ). Therefore, to force a premature expression of   Glis3   in fetal germ cells, we injected tamoxifen to the dam carrying control embryos (  Dppa3-creER  -negative,   R26-Glis3  -positive) and   Glis3  +\u2009mutant (  Dppa3-creER  -positive,   R26-Glis3  -positive) embryos on E10.5 and E11.5. qPCR analysis revealed that   Glis3   expression was significantly higher on E12.5 in the   Glis3  +\u2009testes compared to\u00a0control testes (Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that a premature induction of   Glis3   expression was achieved. The retrotransposon-silencing genes   Dnmt3l  ,   Piwil1  ,   Piwil4   and   Mael   were also significantly increased in   Glis3  +\u2009testes compared to controls, demonstrating that these genes are positively correlated with   Glis3   expression. The specific effect of   Glis3   on retrotransposon silencing genes is further supported by the fact that no significant changes in expression of the somatic cell gene   Wt1   or the generic germ cell gene   Oct4   were observed in   Glis3  +\u2009testes (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ). Together these findings indicate that GLIS3 is sufficient for the induction of several retrotransposon silencing genes in male fetal germ cells. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we identified a novel and critical role for the transcription factor GLIS3 in the regulation of male fetal germ cell development and the induction of retrotransposon silencing pathways.   Glis3   mRNA in fetal mouse testes is expressed in the developing germ cells during a brief window of time from E12.5 to E13.5. The timing of   Glis3   expression in the male mouse germline coincides with several important developmental milestones: the commitment of these cells to a gender-specific developmental program, global demethylation of the germline and activation of the PIWI/piRNA retrotransposon silencing pathway. Global inactivation of   Glis3   did not significantly alter overall testis development, but induced a dramatic loss of male germ cells. Germ cell loss was first detected at E14.5 and was rapidly progressive; very few TRA98 positive germ cells remained at the end of our study, PND5, the latest that homozygous   Glis3   mutant animals can survive. \n\nRNA-Seq analysis of mutant testes before the onset of germ cell loss (E14.5) identified dramatically reduced expression of PIWI/piRNA pathway factors and Nanos genes as well as increased expression of a subset of meiosis related genes. Although no signs of precocious meiotic entry were observed in   Glis3   mutant germs cells, we did find increased expression of multiple LINE and SINE transposon elements, confirming a general suppression of transposon silencing mechanisms in the absence of normal   Glis3  . We further characterized the role of   Glis3   in transposon silencing by forcing its expression in E10.5 germ cells   in vivo   before the normal rise of endogenous   Glis3   using a tamoxifen inducible R26-Glis3 model. We found that exogenous early onset of   Glis3   expression was sufficient to activate expression of critical PIWI/piRNA factors in the fetal male germ cells. The findings described herein identify a novel role for   Glis3   in the activation of transposon silencing systems in male fetal germ cells. \n\nThe progressive germ cell loss phenotype of   Glis3   mutant males is reminiscent of the germ cell defects described for retrotransposon silencing pathway members, including   Dnmt3l  ,   Mael  ,   Tdrd9  ,   Tdrd1  , and all three of the mouse   Piwi-like   family members (  Miwi  ,   Mili  , and   Miwi2  ). Deletion of any single one these genes resulted in increased retrotransposon expression and meiotic arrest, which is coupled with germ cell loss in   Miwi2   and   Dnmt3l   mutants, mostly beginning around 14 days after birth . The most significant difference between these mutant models and our   Glis3   mutant is that the germ cell loss phenotype in   Glis3   mutants occurs much earlier (postnatal vs. fetal). We hypothesize that the earlier onset of germ cell loss in   Glis3   mutants is the result of the global reduction of PIWI/piRNA pathway members, which was detected beginning ~E14.5. It is also possible that retrotransposon de-repression in   Glis3   mutant testes occurs via a (yet to be identified) piRNA-independent mechanism. DNA damage was not detected at the onset of the germ cell loss, but we cannot rule out its contribution to the phenotype. \n\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying gene transactivation by GLIS3 in male germ cells remain to be identified. The loss of male germ cells in the   Glis3   mutant is also accelerated compared to the germ cell phenotype of   Glis3KO2   mice, consistent with the hypomorphic description of the latter mutant allele . \n\nPrevious studies in pancreatic and osteoblast progenitor cells have found three direct targets of GLIS3:   Fgf18  ,   Ins2  ,   and Ngn3  . Via its regulation of these genes, GLIS3 has been implicated in differentiation of the osteoblast  and pancreatic beta cell lineages , respectively. Mice harboring   Glis3   null mutation (the same knockout model used in our study) exhibit polycystic kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, severe hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, resulting in death within the first week of life . Preliminary   in silico   analyses suggest that putative GLIS3 binding sites are found in the promoters of several genes misregulated in   Glis3   mutant testes (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0  and Supplemental Table\u00a0 ). These results point to a direct role for GLIS3 in the silencing of germ cell development genes, however   in vitro   promoter analyses are required to confirm these predictions. \n\nIn summary, we have discovered that   Glis3   is required for normal activation of retrotransposon silencing pathways in male fetal germ cells and is essential for their survival. This work advances our understanding of the factors guiding fetal germ cell development in mammals. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Animals \n  \nAll animal studies were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) Animal Care and Use Committee.   Oct4-eGFP   (#008214) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and CD1 (#022) mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories.   Glis3   mutant mice were previously described;  they harbor a 3.5\u2009kb deletion in exon 4 and parts of introns 3 and 4, resulting in disruption of its DNA-binding capacity and impairment of GLIS3 transcriptional activation function. The   Glis3-eGFP   mouse strain is a knock-in model in which the full-length GLIS3 protein is fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein .   R26-   Glis3   (See Fig. S4A and description below) females were time-mated with   Dppa3-creER   (or   Dppa3-MERcreMER  )  males.   Dppa3   is widely expressed in the pluripotent cells during early embryonic development, but later in development its expression is restricted to the primordial germ cells. Using the   Dppa3-creER   mouse line, Cre-recombinase can be activated with tamoxifen in the primordial germ cells from E9.5 onwards. For timed mating, female mice were housed with male mice overnight and checked for the presence of vaginal plug the next morning. Noon of the day when the vaginal plug was detected was considered embryonic day (E) 0.5. The day of birth was considered postnatal day 0 (PND0). All experiments were performed on at least three animals for each genotype. For Tamoxifen induction, 5\u2009mg of Tamoxifen (cat# T5648, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted in corn oil was injected i.p. on E10.5 and E11.5. The embryos were collected on E12.5. For studying RNA expression, both of the testes were separated from the mesonephros and frozen in \u221280C. RNA was extracted using the Picopure kit according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. \n\n\n### Generation of   R26-Glis3   transgenic mouse line \n  \nIn order to induce   Glis3   expression in a tissue specific manner, we generated a   Rosa-Glis3   mouse line (See Supplemental Figure S ). A   LoxP  -flank stop cassette is located downstream of the CAG promoter and   Glis3   coding sequence, preventing transcription from either the endogenous Rosa26 promoter or the CAG promoter. Following CRE-mediated excision of the stop cassette, a fusion transcript is made that contains the N-terminus HA-tagged, C-terminus FLAG-tagged, GLIS3 coding sequence (HA-GLIS3-FLAG) and dTomato coding sequence. Each transcript has its own ribosomal entry sequence and will produce two distinct proteins, not a fusion GLIS3-dTomato protein. \n\n\n### Tissue Processing and Immunohistochemistry \n  \nFor immunohistochemistry on frozen sections, testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u2009 C overnight, dehydrated through a sucrose gradient, embedded in OCT and cryosectioned at 10\u2009\u00b5m increments. Testes collected after birth were embedded in paraffin wax using the following methods: samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u2009 C overnight, dehydrated through an ethanol gradient, and embedded in paraffin wax. 6-\u00b5m-thick sections were dewaxed and rehydrated in a series of alcohol just prior to immunostaining. All tissue sections (frozen or paraffin sectioned) were preincubated with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1\u2009hour, then incubated with either anti-AMH (1:500; sc-6886, Santa Cruz), anti-GFP (1:500; A1172, Life Technologies) or anti-TRA98 (1:1000, MBL international), in PBS-Triton X-100 solution with 5% normal donkey serum at 4\u2009 C overnight. The antibody-labeled tissue sections were then washed 3 times in PBS and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen) before a final 3 washes (with PBS) and mounting in Vector Mount with DAPI (Vector Labs). Slides were imaged under a Leica DMI4000 confocal microscope. \n\n\n### Estimated germ cell counts \n  \nWhole E14.5 and E15.5 testes were prepared for frozen sections as described above, serial sectioned at 10 \u03bcm increments, immunostained for TRA98, and mounted with DAPI. Slides were scanned using the Aperio Scanscope FL Scanner (Aperio: Leica Biosystems Inc.). To produce representative germ cell counts, every sixth tissue section (60 \u03bcm increments) of individual testis samples was analyzed for both the number of TRA98 positive germ cells and total testis area (by DAPI) using Definiens Tissue Studio Software v3.0 (Definiens). Three to four biological replicates per genotype were analyzed with each containing 8\u201310 tissue sections. Germ cell number is calculated as the total number of TRA98 positive cells per square mm of testis tissue. \n\n\n### Germ cell isolation \n  \nGerm cells were isolated from E13.5   Oct4-eGFP   testes using a previously reported protocol for tissue dissociation and FACS . Briefly,   Oct4-eGFP   testes from individual pups were dissected in PBS, and up to four pairs of testes were pooled for dissociation and sorting. Testes were enzymatically dissociated in PBS containing 1\u2009mg/ml collagenase B (Roche), 1.2 U/ml Dispase II (Roche), and 5 U/ml DNase I (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u201330\u2009minutes with shaking. Cells were further dissociated mechanically using a P200 pipette. After quenching of enzyme activities by addition of 2\u2009mM EDTA, cells were pelleted for 5\u2009min at 1000\u2009g and resuspended in 2\u2009mM EDTA in PBS. Cell-sorting was performed using a BD FACSAria II in the NIEHS Flow Cytometry Center. \n\n\n### RNA extraction and gene expression analysis \n  \nTotal RNA was isolated from frozen cells or tissues using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript II cDNA synthesis system using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels of genes were measured using either SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) or Taqman (Bio-rad) assays. Taqman probe and primer sequences used in qPCR are listed in Supplemental Material, Supplemental Table\u00a0 . Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained using the Bio-Rad CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection system. The relative fold change of each transcript was calculated using the mathematical model of Pfaffl  and was normalized to   Mapk1   (Fig.\u00a0 ), or   Gapdh   (all other graphs) as an endogenous reference. All qPCR analyses were performed in duplicate, and the results were reported from at least three independent experiments. Results are presented as fold change calculated relative to WT controls. All values were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, and statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student   t  -  test   with Welch\u2019s correction and one-tailed p-value (GraphPad Prism). The sample sizes were 11 for the control testis and 14 for the   Glis3  +\u2009testes. \n\n\n### RNA-Sequencing library generation \n  \nRNA from a single pair of E14.5 testes (one biological replica) was extracted using the PicoPure extraction kit (Arcturus). Three or four biological replicas were used for each genotype. RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from ~0.3\u2009\u03bcg total RNA after rRNA depletion using Ribo-Zero GOLD (Illumina). The Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep V2 Kit was used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions except where noted. The poly-A selection step was omitted and random primers were used for first-strand synthesis. cDNAs were fragmented to ~275\u2009bp using a Covaris E210. Amplification was performed using 16 cycles, which was optimized for the input amount and to minimize the chance of over-amplification. Unique barcode adapters were applied to each library. The pooled libraries were sequenced on multiple lanes of a HiSeq. 2500 using version 4 chemistry to achieve a minimum of 40 million 125 base read pairs. The data was processed using RTA version 1.18.61 and CASAVA 1.8.2. \n\n\n### RNA-Sequencing data processing \n  \nGeneral quality control checks were performed with FastQC v0.8.0 (31). Each dataset was filtered for average base quality score (>20). Multiple runs of the same sample library were merged prior to analysis. Filtered datasets were mapped against the mm10 reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12 (parameters\u2013b2-sensitive\u2013library-typefr-unstranded-g10\u2013mate-innerdist-60\u2013mate-std-dev 50) (32). Differential analysis at the gene level was performed with Cuffdiff v2.2.1 (33) at default parameters, using RefSeq gene model annotations downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser as of March 9, 2015. Differentially expressed genes were identified using default Cuffdiff criteria (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Heatmaps were constructed with heatmap.2 (gplots R package) based on FPKM scores calculated by the Cuffquant/Cuffnorm v2.2.1 workflow. Assessment of repeat elements are based on RepeatMasker annotations downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (timestamp March 7, 2012). For identification of individual differentially expressed retrotransposons, only uniquely-mapped hits were retained for analysis. Mapped read counts for each annotated RepeatMasker element were collected with HTSeq-count . The dataset was then reduced to only LINE, SINE, and LTR annotations with a minimum average depth of 1 read per replicate; the resulting data matrix included approximately 460k individual RepeatMasker annotations. DESeq2 DESeq2  was then used to identify differentially expressed elements at an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.1. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nData were analyzed using Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software) by unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test\u00a0with Welch\u2019s correction and one-tailed p-value.

This has led to the development of biologics that inhibit SIRP\u03b1 engagement including humanized CD47 antibodies and a soluble SIRP\u03b1 decoy receptor that are currently undergoing clinical trials. Unfortunately, toxicological issues, including anemia related to on-target mechanisms, are barriers to their clinical advancement. Another potential issue with large biologics that bind CD47 is perturbation of CD47 signaling through its high-affinity interaction with the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). One approach to avoid these shortcomings is to identify and develop small molecule molecular probes and pretherapeutic agents that would (1) selectively target SIRP\u03b1 or TSP1 interactions with CD47, (2) provide a route to optimize pharmacokinetics, reduce on-target toxicity and maximize tissue penetration, and (3) allow more flexible routes of administration. As the first step toward this goal, we report the development of an automated quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assay platform capable of screening large diverse drug-like chemical libraries to discover novel small molecules that inhibit CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction. Using time-resolved F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) and bead-based luminescent oxygen channeling assay formats (AlphaScreen), we developed biochemical assays, optimized their performance, and individually tested them in small-molecule library screening. Based on performance and low false positive rate, the LANCE TR-FRET assay was employed in a ~90,000 compound library qHTS, while the AlphaScreen oxygen channeling assay served as a cross-validation orthogonal assay for follow-up characterization. With this multi-assay strategy, we successfully eliminated compounds that interfered with the assays and identified five compounds that inhibit the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction; these compounds will be further characterized and later disclosed. Importantly, our results validate the large library qHTS for antagonists of CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction and suggest broad applicability of this approach to screen chemical libraries for other protein-protein interaction modulators. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe immune system can detect and eliminate cancer cells [ \u2013 ]. However, tumors arise and persist largely due to acquired adaptations that enable tumor cells to avoid immune destruction by restricting innate immune surveillance [ ], limiting cytotoxic T cell activity [ ], and promoting overall immune tolerance [ ]. Successful new immuno-oncology drugs such as antibodies targeting the immune checkpoints PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4(CD80/CD86) remove tumor barriers to the adaptive immune response, enabling T cells to attack tumors, and lead to remarkably durable responses in some melanoma [ , ], lung [ ], head and neck [ ], and bladder [ ] cancer patients. Other immunotherapies that modulate this adaptive immune response, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells [ ] and dendritic cell vaccines [ ], also show promise. However, overall clinical response rates remain low for T cell therapies in solid tumors [ , ], highlighting the need for additional immunotherapeutic strategies. \n\nCD47 is expressed on the surface of normal cells and binds to its counter-receptor SIRP\u03b1 expressed on macrophages to inhibit phagocytosis [ \u2013 ]. In healthy tissues, this forms the basis of innate immune tolerance (the \u201cDon\u2019t Eat Me\u201d signal). Decreases in CD47 expression promote the removal of aged or damaged cells [ ], while increased expression facilitates the preservation of nascent hematopoietic stem cells [ ]. As little as ~2-fold changes in CD47 expression can affect its regulation of cell turnover [ \u2013 ]. \n\nSome types of tumor cells have co-opted the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 signaling axis by elevating their CD47 expression [ , \u2013 ] to downregulate phagocytosis and avoid innate immune surveillance. Secondarily, decreased phagocytosis impedes anti-tumor adaptive immunity by inhibiting antigen presentation and anti-tumor T cell priming by SIRP\u03b1-expressing dendritic cells, microglial cells, and tumor-associated macrophages [ \u2013 ]. A growing number of hematological and solid tumors are known to express elevated CD47 levels, which correlate with poorer prognosis [ , , ]. CD47-targeting therapies have extensive preclinical validation, and targeting CD47 with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in xenograft models of ovarian, colon, breast, bladder, lung, pancreatic carcinoma, glioma, and leiomyosarcoma enhances macrophage activity and tumor elimination [ , , ]. Using syngeneic models, we and others demonstrated that the anti-tumor efficacy of targeting CD47 requires both innate and adaptive immune activation for breast and colorectal cancer, melanoma, and B cell lymphomas [ , , , ]. We showed that in preclinical models of metastatic breast cancer, disrupting CD47 with MAbs or antisense suppression increased chemotherapeutic and trastuzumab/Herceptin-mediated clearance of tumors, and also prevented lung metastases and protected the heart from cardiomyopathic effects of DNA-damaging chemotherapy [ , ]. Therefore, a CD47-targeting therapeutic has strong potential for treatment of a broad range of tumor types through multiple immune- and non-immune-mediated mechanisms. \n\nHumanized MAbs and a SIRP\u03b1-Fc decoy receptor targeting CD47 are now in early stages of clinical development based on the compelling body of preclinical results and human tumor expression data. Recently, a combination of rituximab and an anti-CD47 antibody (Hu5F9) successfully completed a phase 1b safety study and showed anecdotal evidence of response in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma [ ]. However, biologics targeting CD47 in clinical trials have exhibited clinical liabilities including 1) on-target toxicities leading to hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [ \u2013 ], 2) limited/variable tissue penetration and distribution into tumors, and 3) a large CD47 antigen sink in the vascular compartment [ ]. \n\nSmall molecules offer unique advantages to maximize the therapeutic benefit of disrupting the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction. These include the potential to 1) optimize the half-life to reduce side effects due to a long period of high target occupancy, allowing for better management of efficacy vs. toxicity; 2) increase tissue and solid tumor distribution; 3) develop oral bioavailability to increase patient convenience, compliance and reduce the cost of treatment. Additionally, the tumor-immune biology of CD47 is complex and involves its other ligand thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) [ \u2013 ]. We and others have shown that selectively blocking TSP1-CD47 interaction leads to protection of T cells from anti-tumor radiation therapy through enhanced metabolic fitness [ ], greater anti-tumor activity [ , ], and greater radiation efficacy with low/no side effects in syngeneic mouse tumor models [ ]. The SIRP\u03b1 interaction surface of CD47 is evident in co-crystal structures (PDB: 2JJS, 2JJT) and, as described by Hatherley et al. [ ], includes the region centered on the FG loop (Gly92 \u2013Tyr 113) and N-terminal pyroglutamate of CD47 (   ). By contrast, the interaction site of TSP1 on CD47 can only be inferred through biochemical studies defining the necessity of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan modification at CD47 Ser64 [ ]. With this limited information, we infer that the binding sites of SIRP\u03b1 and TSP1 do not overlap on CD47 [ ]. It has been shown that biologics in clinical development bind CD47 and appear to sterically block binding of both ligands [ ]. We hypothesize that chemical probes can be generated that block CD47 signaling in a ligand-selective manner by either targeting distinct sites on CD47 (while not sterically interfering with the second ligand binding site) or by individually targeting the CD47 ligands. Ligand-selective chemical probes are not currently available and would be valuable new agents to study CD47 function and mechanism of action   in vitro   and   in vivo  . \n   SIRP\u03b1 and TSP1 interaction with CD47.  \nThe SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interface is defined by the co-crystal structure (PDB 2JJT) and is represented on the extracellular domain surfaces of CD47 (residues 20\u2013136; gray) and SIRP\u03b1 (residues 31\u2013149; orange). The TSP1 interaction with CD47 is not well-defined but depends on a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan modification (HSPG; green) at CD47 Ser64 (magenta) and can be functionally minimized to the TSP1 peptide known as 7N3 ( FIRVVMYEGKK , light blue) shown on the surface of the C-terminal CD47-interacting domain of TSP1 (E3CaG1; PDB 1UX6; residues 834\u20131170; blue). As a molecular size reference, the clinical stage protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor navitoclax (974.6 Da) is shown (PDB 4LVT). PPI inhibitors are generally larger small molecules, and navitoclax is roughly 2x the mass of a typical small molecule drug. The N- and C-termini of the constructs are indicated. \n  \nOur first goal is to discover small molecules that disrupt the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 protein-protein interaction (PPI) and develop them into ligand-selective CD47 inhibitors for use as research tools and pretherapeutic lead compounds for numerous cancers. We leveraged the well-described biochemical characterizations of the soluble CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interacting domains [ , , ] as the basis for creating high throughput screening (HTS)-compatible PPI inhibitor assays. While libraries of PPI-focused chemical screening material continue to evolve [ \u2013 ], many HTS-compatible biochemical assays of PPIs have been reported with a range of commercially available reagents (as reviewed in [ , ]). Among these, time-resolved F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET, HTRF[ ]) and amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (ALPHA) screens [ ] are the most widely used for non-peptide-based PPI assays. They offer the ability to \u201cmix and read\u201d in a homogeneous format (no washing step required) that is compatible with a range of protein affinity tags and ultra-high density plates (1536 well). Such assays have been used successfully in the discovery of PPI inhibitors [ ]. \n\nHerein, we describe the primary steps in this discovery and development project that involved the creation and validation of biochemical quantitative HTS (qHTS) assays capable of measuring CD47-SIRP\u03b1 disrupting activity of large libraries of chemically diverse small molecules. We describe the properties of these assays that enable the efficient differentiation of active molecules from artifacts. We also provide a technology comparison for common commercial screening reagents employed in biochemical PPI assays to inform future screening campaigns. Lastly, the performance of the validated assays is evaluated in a large library, automated primary qHTS and follow-up study to show the configuration and utility of these assays in a discovery screening campaign. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Protein expression and purification \n  \n CD47-CD4-6His  : CD47\u2019s extracellular domain (Gln19\u2014Pro139) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pTT3 to create a fusion with rat CD4 (domains 3 and 4) and a 6XHis affinity tag (herein referred to as CD47-CD4-6His). CD47 Cys33 was mutated to Gly to avoid protein aggregation [ ]. Protein was expressed in expi293F cells using the expi293 expression system reagents (Thermo-Fisher). Protein was harvested and purified using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a final yield of 19 mg per Liter of cell culture. The purified protein was stored in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl at a concentration of 52.5 \u03bcM. \n\n SIRP  \u03b1: the codon-optimized extracellular domain d1 of SHPS-1 isoform 1 (residues 31\u2013149; UNIPROT P78324) with an N-terminal 6XHis-thioredoxin-SUMO-tag and a C-terminal biotin ligation sequence (Avi-Tag) was synthesized by BIOBASIC, Inc and cloned into the multi-cloning site 1 (MCS1) of the expression vector pCDF-Duet between the NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites. The protein was expressed in Origami B (DE3) cells (Novagen). Cells were cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C. The next day, protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl 1-thio-D-galactopyranoside when   A   reached 1.0. Cells were cold shocked on ice for 1 hour and grown at 20\u00b0C for 24 h, then pelleted and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further use. To purify SIRP\u03b1-Avi, cell pellets were lysed in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol), 15 units/ml benzonase (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) via sonication. The clarified supernatant was then applied on a Nickel HisTrap affinity column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a 3\u2013100% gradient of buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 M imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol). The His-Trx-SUMO tag was removed by ULP1 cleavage (overnight, 4\u00b0C) in dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol). The cleaved protein was subsequently biotinylated   in vitro   using BirA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Avidity, Inc). The mixture was then passed on a Nickel HisTrap and QHP anion exchange chromatography columns to remove the cleaved tag, ULP1 and BirA. The final step was size exclusion on Superdex 75 in buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl). Fractions containing SIRP\u03b1-biotin were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and concentrated. Aliquots at concentrations between 490 \u03bcM and 1.8 mM were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70\u00b0C. The final yield was ~15\u201320 mg of pure SIRP\u03b1-biotin protein per Liter of cell culture. Non-biotin-labeled SIRP\u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1-cold) was purified Nickel His-Trap and SEC yielding ~30\u201340 mg of pure protein per Liter of cell culture. \n\n SIRP  \u03b1  -Fc  : the extracellular domain (comprised of the d1, d2, and d3 domains) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV1 to create a C-terminal fusion with human IgG Fc. The protein was expressed in HEK293T cells grown in DMEM with 1% BSA (no serum) and harvested between days 2 and 7 after transfection (Turbofect; ThermoFisher). The Antibody Purification Kit (PROSEP-G; Millipore) was used to purify SIRP\u03b1-Fc from the conditioned media to >95% purity. The final protein was dialyzed and stored at a concentration of 1.8 mg/mL in PBS buffer at -70\u00b0C. \n\n\n### Surface plasmon resonance binding studies \n  \nThe SIRP\u03b1 and CD47 extracellular domain interaction was analyzed using the BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore, GE) at 25\u00b0C. SIRP\u03b1-biotin was loaded onto channel 2 of a streptavidin (SAV)-functionalized CM chip (Xantec SCB SAHC 1000M) at 150 nM (PBS, 0.005% IGEPAL) with an injection time of 6 min and a flow rate of 10 \u03bcL/min to yield a response of 5416 RU. Response to CD47 binding was measured at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/min and an injection time of 2 min. The SIRP\u03b1 surface was regenerated between CD47 concentration runs using 10 mM Glycine buffered to pH 2.0. \n\n\n### Compound libraries \n  \nThe 1,280 compound LOPAC (Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The LOPAC library was supplied at 10 mM concentration in DMSO and arrayed into 1536-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One 782855) in a serial 7-point dilution scheme (stock conc: 10 mM, 2.5 mM, 625 \u03bcM, 156 \u03bcM, 39 \u03bcM, 9.8 \u03bcM, 2.4 \u03bcM). Aluminum adhesive plate seals were applied with an Abgene Seal-IT 100 (Rochester, NY) plate sealer and plates were stored at ambient temperature in a desiccated dry-keep. The Genesis compound library ( ) comprised 94,965 samples at the time of screening, and was screened in a serial 6 or 7-pt qHTS as above. \n\n\n### qHTS assays \n  \nReagents were diluted in room temperature assay buffer according to final concentrations in   ,   and all manipulation/incubations were subsequently carried out at room temperature. \n   Optimized assay conditions for 1536-well plate format.           TR-FRET assay protocol.         ALPHAScreen assay protocol.      \n\n### Data analysis \n  \nSignal to background (S/B) was calculated as mean specific signal/mean background signal. Percent corrected values (%CV) for the positive and negative controls were calculated as mean signal/standard deviation. Z\u2019 was calculated from positive and negative controls as in Zhang et al. [ ]. Concentration-response curves (CRC) from the qHTS were determined from the normalized and corrected data as previously described [ ]. CRCs for each compound were curve-fitted and categorized into four major curve classifications (cc) as described [ ], using open access NCATS software ( ). The CDD Vault software platform was subsequently used for data sharing and cross assay comparisons. \n\n\n### Database deposition \n  \nThe LOPAC data generated in this study has been deposited in PubChem ( ), use \u201ckeyword\u201d = AID in the pulldown menu.

CD47-CD4-6His was produced in a mammalian expression system and was previously shown to bind recombinant SIRP\u03b1 [ ]. As expected, recombinant CD47-CD4-6His was highly glycosylated, migrating as a diffuse band at ~60 kDa, as compared to the molecular weight of 40 kDa predicted from the protein sequence (   ). The heterogeneity in glycosylation of CD47 has no reported effect on its ability to bind SIRP\u03b1 [ ]. \n\nNon-glycosylated SIRP\u03b1 binds CD47 with high nM affinity [ ]. However, recombinant SIRP\u03b1 containing abnormally high and heterogeneous glycosylation showed impaired CD47 binding [ ]. To reduce biological assay variability, we chose to produce SIRP\u03b1 in a glycosylation-deficient system. SIRP\u03b1-Avi (Isoform 1 allele 1) is expressed in   E  .   coli   as a fusion construct that comprises an N-terminal purification tag followed by the extracellular CD47-binding fragment of SIRP\u03b1 linked to a C-terminal Avi-Tag. After affinity capture and tag cleavage, SIRP\u03b1-Avi was biotinylated   in vitro   (SIRP\u03b1-biotin) using purified recombinant   E  .   coli   biotin ligase (BirA) to >98% incorporation, as measured by mass spectrometry (   ). The purified protein is monomeric as judged by SEC. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies (see    ) confirmed that SIRP\u03b1 is monomeric in solution (up to at least 1.8 mM), with the C-terminal Avi-tag positioned away from the CD47-binding region, demonstrating its suitability for our assay (  )  . \n\nTo validate the biologically relevant interaction between our PPI reagents, we used SPR spectroscopy to measure their steady state binding affinity (   ). SIRP\u03b1-biotin was immobilized on a SAV-chip with CD47-CD4-6His injected at multiple concentrations to yield a K  of approximately 200 nM. This is comparable to a previous report of 300 nM and 279 nM employing similar constructs and measurement via SPR [ , ] and 470 nM for soluble CD47 binding to SIRP\u03b1-expressing CHO cells measured by fluorescence intensity [ ]. \n   Validation of recombinant construct binding affinity by SPR.  \nSIRP\u03b1-biotin was immobilized on a SAV-chip followed by injection of CD47-CD4-6His at varying concentrations. (A) The association and dissociation responses are shown as an overlay for each concentration tested. (B) The maximum response of the association phase was plotted against concentration and fitted to a steady-state binding curve to approximate the K  of the interaction pair. \n  \n\n### Assay development \n  \nWe developed a TR-FRET assay to quantitatively measure the interaction of CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 [ ]. We started with the TR-FRET reagents from CisBio for feasibility and optimization studies. The donor reagent consists of an anti-6His monoclonal antibody tagged with a Terbium cryptate (61HI2TLA) to provide a long-lived fluorescent signal bound to the 6His tag of CD47 (   ). The acceptor consists of streptavidin tagged with an XL665 fluorochrome (SAV-XL665; 610SAXLA) to associate with the biotin tag on SIRP\u03b1. Feasibility testing was conducted in 384-well format to assess signal to background and assay specificity. Using the experimentally determined K  as a starting point (see    ), CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 concentrations of 100 nM resulted in a S/B of 5 compared to the same mixture lacking CD47 (   ). To find the optimal concentration of protein reagents for each assay, each component was titrated to saturation (   ). We then miniaturized the assay volumes for use in 1536-well format and proceeded to test feasibility and further optimize the assay (   ). Finally, using the adjusted ligand protein concentrations, we optimized assay buffer, donor and acceptor levels, plate type, order of reagent addition, and incubation time (   and   ). Briefly, we found that nM concentrations of CD47 (12.5 nM) and SIRP\u03b1 (100nM) in PBS buffer with minimal detergent (0.005% IGEPAL CA-630) and BSA (0.1%) produced a robust assay. \n   Schematic for qHTS assays.  \nTR-FRET based assays (upper panel) and ALPHAScreen assay (lower panel). CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 represented as their x-ray crystal structures from PDB 2JJS, chain D and chain B, respectively. \n     Optimization of CisBio TR-FRET assay.  \n(A) Initial assay feasibility performed in 384-well plate format using CisBio TR-FRET reagents. CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 were tested at 2 concentrations (20 nM and 100 nM), and the FRET ratio of the complete reaction was compared to controls lacking either CD47 or SIRP\u03b1 to calculate the S/B (n = 16). (B) CD47 or (C) SIRP\u03b1 concentrations were titrated while the other was fixed as indicated in (A) in 384-well plates to find their optimal assay concentrations as judged by S/B (n = 4). (D) Assay performance in 384-well or 1536-well formats compared using optimized concentrations derived from panels B and C. Assay Z\u2019 indicated for each plate type (n = 32). \n  \nSecond, we developed the LANCE (LANthanide Chelate Excite) TR-FRET assay, which consists of an anti-6His monoclonal antibody linked to an Eu-chelate (Anti-6His-Eu; AD0110) for the donor associated with the CD47 reagent and streptavidin linked to allophycocyanin (SAV-APC; AD0201) as acceptor associated with SIRP\u03b1. Using the optimized CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 concentrations from the CisBio assay optimization as a starting point, the LANCE assay reagents were titrated in 1536-well format to arrive at a S/B of 12 (   and   ) using optimal conditions outlined in    . As with the CisBio assay (   ), the endpoint is stable (\u226580% of initial signal) for at least 48 h (   ). \n   Optimized assay performance in 1536 well plate format.      \nThird, we developed the AlphaScreen assay as a cross validation orthogonal assay. It uses a bead-based luminescent oxygen channeling [ ] technology based on the transfer of energy from the laser-excited (680 nm) donor bead to acceptor beads in the form of singlet oxygen to produce a luminescent signal (520\u2013620 nm) [ , ]. Singlet oxygen has a limited lifetime (4 \u03bcsec half-life) prior to relaxing back to ground state during which it can diffuse approximately 200 nm in solution. If an acceptor bead is within that distance, energy is transferred from the singlet oxygen to thioxene derivatives within the acceptor bead, subsequently culminating in light production at 520\u2013620 nm. In the absence of an acceptor bead, singlet oxygen relaxes to ground state and no signal is produced. This proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer is the basis for ALPHAScreen's homogeneous format (   ). \n\nThe ALPHAScreen assay was optimized using the CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 concentrations from the CisBio assay development as a starting point. While the optimal CD47 concentration remained unchanged throughout the three assays, the optimal SIRP\u03b1 concentration is 4-fold lower for the ALPHAScreen assay, possibly due to the differences in SAV-bead-binding capacity versus streptavidin in solution. Optimization also allowed for a 2-fold lower bead concentration than suggested by the manufacturer, reducing the cost per data point [ ]. The resulting ALPHAScreen assay yielded robust HTS parameters (Z\u2019 of 0.79, S/B = 75;    ), a slightly faster read time than the TR-FRET assays (9 min/plate vs. 14 min/plate), and a common assay buffer and plate type with the CisBio and LANCE assays (   ). \n\n\n### Assay validation \n  \nWe evaluated the performance of all three assays in a qHTS format using SIRP\u03b1-cold (non-biotinylated) as a specific inhibitor of SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction. The IC  values exhibited good agreement with those obtained from the TR-FRET assay (2.8 \u03bcM and 1.1 \u03bcM for CisBio and LANCE, respectively) and the ALPHAScreen assay (0.55 \u03bcM;    ). Hill slopes indicate a near ideal bimolecular interaction (1.2\u20131.5,    ). We also evaluated the ability of a small molecule to act as an inhibitor in the assay, as the eventual goal of the HTS assay will be to screen large chemical libraries for small molecule antagonists of the protein-protein interaction between SIRP\u03b1-CD47. As there are no known small molecule inhibitors of this interaction, we chose to use free biotin to inhibit the interaction between SIRP\u03b1 and the streptavidin-conjugated assay reagents. Free-biotin was added in advance to the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 complex prior to the addition of the streptavidin-conjugated reagent to overcome the extraordinarily slow off-rate of the complex once formed [ ]. The activity of biotin was similar for all assays and exhibited the same inter-assay potency ranking as the large molecule SIRP\u03b1-cold (AlphaScreen>LANCE>CisBio;    ). The IC  values of 260, 170, 115 nM were comparable to results generated by Perkin Elmer for similar assays evaluating the interference of biotin in assay media [ ]. The cooperativity indicated by the Hill slope of between 2 and 3 is likely due to the multivalency of streptavidin and reflects the need to block multiple sites before the proximity signal is eliminated. This contrasts with SIRP\u03b1-cold\u2019s interaction with the bivalent CD47-CD4-6His/anti-His antibody shown above. Assay robustness indicated by Z\u2019 factor was \u201cexcellent\u201d [ ] (see    ) and allowed for advancement to pilot screening using the 1280 compound LOPAC Library (Sigma). \n   Validation of assay specificity and performance.  \n(A) Assay specificity was validated using SIRP\u03b1-cold titrated to inhibit the CD47-binding activity of SIRP\u03b1-biotin in the screening assays. Hill slope and IC  are indicated (n = 4). (B) Assay performance using a positive control small molecule (biotin) was assessed in all three assays (n = 1). Normalized activity calculated with neutral control (+CD47, +SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as 0% and low control (-CD47 +SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as -100% activity. Assay activity with tested agents was then compared and normalized to these controls. \n  \n\n### Pilot screening assay comparison \n  \nThe LOPAC library was tested in qHTS format using a 7-point inter-plate titration spanning 38 \u03bcM to 2.4 nM (final concentration) in 1536-well format. All assays displayed robust performance as judged by Z\u2019 factor, a statistical measure of the separations of the positive and negative control distributions. The Z\u2019 was determined using column 1 and 2 of each plate as positive and negative controls, respectively (  Figs   and   ). \n   High and low control signal performance in pilot screening.  \nResults for the (A) CisBio, (B) LANCE, and (C) AlphaScreen assays shown. Individual signal data points from neutral control (+CD47, +SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) and low control (+CD47 -SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) plotted by well for each plate in the 10-plate pilot screening run (n = 32 points per plate). Dotted lines represent + and\u2013 20% of average signal for each high and low control. The Z\u2019 factor was calculated from the high and low controls on each plate and averaged across all plates. \n     Control inhibitor performance in pilot screening.  \nResults for the (A) CisBio, (B) LANCE, and (C) AlphaScreen assays shown. SIRP\u03b1-cold was titrated as a control inhibitor in each assay (n = 2). Error bars represent the standard deviation of two replicates. The average IC  and minimum significant ratio (MSR) was calculated over the 10-plate run for each screening assay. MSR is defined as the smallest ratio between the potencies of two compounds that is statistically significant and is calculated as MSR = 10 , where s is an estimate of the standard deviation of a log potency for one compound. \n  \nActivity of library compounds was analyzed according to the curve classification (cc) as previously described [ , ]. Briefly, compounds were considered active when they displayed either concentration-dependent inhibition with two asymptotes and incomplete activity (-50\u201390%; cc -1.2), complete activity at the highest tested concentrations (<-90%; cc -2.1), or complete inhibition with two asymptotes indicating a saturable effect (<-90%; cc -1.1), as shown in    . The highest overall activity was demonstrated in the AlphaScreen (17 out of 1280; 1.3%;    ) followed by the CisBio TR-FRET assay (15 out of 1280; 1.2%) and the LANCE TR-FRET assay (3 out of 1280; 0.2%). \n   qHTS activity plots for LOPAC compounds.  \nResults shown using (A) CisBio, (B) LANCE, and (C) AlphaScreen assays. Concentration response curves fit to data of active compounds using a 4-parameter logistic equation are included with solid lines. Black lines indicate activity only within the indicated assay. Blue lines indicate activity in both CisBio and AlphaScreen assays. Red lines indicate activity in all three assays. \n     Classification of active compounds from LOPAC screening.        \nWe further characterized activity of these compounds with additional assay readouts, counter-screening assays, data characteristics, and reported compound promiscuity. Assay interference by chemical matter can take many forms in biochemical HTS assays [ , ] and can be mediated by compound fluorescence or aggregation, signal attenuation by absorbance, or singlet oxygen quenching and affinity tag-disruption in the case of the AlphaScreen. \n\nIn the TR-FRET assays, fluorescent compounds or attenuators were identified using an additional readout of donor channel fluorescence data. Changes in donor fluorescence that mirror or contribute to overall activity (ratio of FRET/donor) indicate assay interference and these compounds were removed from further consideration [ ]. Donor channel artifacts were observed for 14 of the 15 CisBio assay active molecules (   ), and for 2 of the 3 LANCE actives (   ), resulting in 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA as the only remaining candidate in both TR-FRET assays, which is known to have activity in a number of unrelated assays and is considered a promiscuous molecule. For AlphaScreen-active compounds, we employed an additional counter-screen assay (TruHits, Perkin Elmer) where the tagged SIRP\u03b1 and CD47 interaction pair was replaced by a single dual-tagged peptide (Biotin-peptide-6XHis). Compounds displaying activity in this counter-screen do not specifically disrupt the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction but are rather affinity tag disruptors, singlet oxygen or fluorescence quenchers, or possibly protein aggregators. Accordingly, 3 of 17 active molecules displayed counter-screen activity and were removed from further consideration (   ). \n   LOPAC active compounds from the CisBio TR-FRET assay.  \nNormalized activity signal for the donor and acceptor channels and calculated ratio signal for each active compound reported for the 7-point concentration response generated using qHTS. Normalized activity was calculated with neutral control (+CD47 +SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as 0% and low control (+CD47 -SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as -100% activity. Assay activity with tested compounds was then compared and normalized within this range. (A) Compounds that interfered with donor fluorescence indicated by activity in the donor channel.

Assay activity with tested compounds was then compared and normalized within this range. (A) Compounds that interfered with donor fluorescence indicated by activity in the donor channel. (B) Reactive compound active in a variety of other unrelated screening assays (Pubchem). \n     LOPAC active compounds from the AlphaScreen assay.  \nNormalized activity signal for the specific AlphaScreen assay (Alpha) and the non-specific counter screen assay (counter) for each active compound reported for the 7-point concentration response generated using qHTS. Normalized activity in the AlphaScreen assay was calculated with neutral control (CD47 + SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as 0% and negative control (CD47\u2014SIRP\u03b1, no inhibitor) as -100% activity. Normalized activity in the counter screen assay was calculated with neutral control (+TruHits reagent, no inhibitor) as 0% and negative control (-TruHits reagent, no inhibitor) as -100% activity. Assay activity with tested compounds was then compared and normalized within this range. (A) Compounds that interfered with the assay as indicated by significant activity in the counter screen assay. (B) Reactive compounds identified as active in a variety of other unrelated screening assays. \n  \nThe remaining active molecules were further scrutinized for non-ideal behavior that would indicate a mechanism other than CD47-SIRP\u03b1 antagonism. A now well-recognized mechanism of assay interference involves molecules that tend to aggregate in aqueous assay buffers and adsorb assay reagents to result in apparent inhibitory activity [ \u2013 ]. As this phenomenon occurs at a threshold where the test molecule reaches its solubility limit, the concentration response curves will exhibit a steep Hill slope near the solubility limit [ ]. Hill slopes are then an indicator of non-specific activity, and compounds were flagged as non-ideal inhibitors when they displayed Hill slopes outside of the -0.5 to -1.5 range, with the understanding that this does not definitively identify problematic molecules as aggregators [ ]. To avoid compound aggregation and associated assay interference, all primary assays and follow-up tests were run with detergent present [ , ]. \n\nIn the case of the lone active molecule in the TR-FRET assays (6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA), its Hill slope falls within tolerance for both the CisBio and LANCE assays. Of the AlphaScreen actives, aurintricarboxylic acid, cephalosporin C, Apresoline, Indirubin-3'-oxime, 2,2'-Bipyridyl, CGS-15943, L-Histidine hydrochloride, and ruthenium red all displayed Hill slopes outside of our acceptance criteria and were discarded. The remaining actives (morin, rotterlin, 1,10-Phenanthroline monohydrate, Quinolinic acid, Fusaric acid, and 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA) have PAINS characteristics ([ , , ] and the ChEMBL database) that would make them likely false positives and unsuitable for follow-up. 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA is also suspected of assay interference due to its aggregator activity (see above) and in other studies [ ], PAINS characteristics (as defined in the ChEMBL database), known redox reactivity, and assay promiscuity (active in 119 of 386 assays in Pubchem [ ] at the time of manuscript preparation). Despite its well-recognized assay interfering activity, the activity of 6-Hydroxy-DL-DOPA in our assays was consistent with a well-behaved hit compound, and it was also the only consistently active molecule in all qHTS assays. It was thus selected for follow-up testing. \n\nA fresh powder sample of 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA was acquired from the supplier and authenticated via HPLC-MS from a 10 mM DMSO stock. Follow-up testing in the qHTS assays resulted in similar if not slightly more potent activity (   ; CisBio and AlphaScreen). The compound was then evaluated for SIRP\u03b1-CD47 disrupting activity in the previously described SPR assay (vide infra) but failed to inhibit the protein-protein interaction under conditions similar to those of the qHTS assays. \n   6-Hydroxy-DL-Dopamine follow-up testing comparison to primary screening.  \nResults shown for the (A) CisBio, (B) LANCE, and (C) AlphaScreen assays. Follow-up testing was conducted using freshly plated compound from powder stocks in an 11-point concentration response (n = 1). \n  \nAs mentioned above, 6-Hydroxy-DL-DOPA is a known aggregator. This type of interference should lead to activity in the AlphaScreen counter screen assay. However, we found none in our assay, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In this experiment, the control peptide is premixed with both the acceptor and donor beads to form the complex and subsequently added to assay wells followed by the compounds. Under these conditions, the preformed bead-peptide complex may be kinetically and physically insensitive to aggregated compound. By comparison, in the primary assay, reagent proteins are exposed to the aggregated compound before the addition of beads. To unambiguously determine whether 6-Hydroxy-DL-DOPA showed interfering activity in the counter screen, we changed the protocol to more closely match the primary assay. Under these revised conditions (counter screen v.2), the peptide is added first to the wells, followed by the compound, then the beads (   ). The revised conditions revealed activity in the counter screen assay v.2 that was similar to the primary screen assay and identified 6-Hydroxy-DL-DOPA as an interfering molecule. Therefore, it was eliminated from further consideration. In conclusion, no compounds were identified as specific inhibitors for the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction from the pilot screening study. However, we developed assays and counter assays that excluded many interfering compounds and that can be applied to larger chemically diverse collections and screening campaigns. \n   Comparison of 6-Hydroxy-DL-DOPA AlphaScreen.  \nActivity shown using the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 PPI assay (left panel) and the counter screen assay run under different reagent addition sequences (right panel). \n  \n\n### Assay performance in fully-automated large library qHTS \n  \nWe tested the performance of the above assays positioned as part of a large library, fully-automated, qHTS campaign. We used a primary screen with downstream counter and orthogonal screening assays capable of identifying assay artifacts from compounds active in primary screening. For the primary screen, we chose the LANCE TR-FRET assay as it had the best Z\u2019 factor and lowest compound interference profile during pilot screening (   ). As a counter screen we utilized the LANCE TR-FRET assay with a 6XHis-biotin peptide in place of the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction (as in the AlphaScreen counter screen assay described above). This allowed for assessment of assay-interfering compounds with the same TR-FRET reagents as the primary screen. Orthogonal screening was used to confirm active compounds and was performed using the AlphaScreen SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction assay as described above. To test this assay configuration, we screened a large (94,965 compounds), diverse (1,000 scaffolds that vary in representation from 20 to 100 compounds per chemotype), highly curated (PAINS, Lipinsky), lead-like (sp3-enriched, spirocyclic, novel chemotypes) chemical library (Genesis, NCATS) formatted as a 6 and 7-point interplate concentration response in 1536-well source plates. Screening was performed with the NCATS automation group using the fully-automated Kalypsis Robotic platform employing the same liquid dispensing, compound pinning, and endpoint measurement equipment as was used offline in the pilot screening. In this format, primary screening was performed on 409 plates over the course of 4 screening days. Screening day 2 included 200 plates translating to a peak throughput of over 40,000 compounds per day in 6 and 7-point concentration responses. The primary assay was robust (S/B = 17.6 \u00b1 2.2, CV = 2.0% \u00b1 0.6, and a Z\u2032 of 0.93 \u00b1 0.3;    ) as calculated from the control wells of each plate in the series. \n   qHTS screen of the NCATS Genesis library (94,965 compounds) using the LANCE TR-FRET assay.  \n(A) Z\u2019 factor calculated from the intraplate controls. (B) Normalized activity of all compounds tested in a 6-point concentration response. Rendered curves represent all compounds displaying an activity with negative curve class. The curves rendered in red have a maximum activity \u2264-25%. \n  \nDue to the low level of activity in the screen, compounds were selected for follow-up studies if they exhibited a negative curve classification (all curves in    ) and a maximum normalized response of <-25% (red curves in    ). This resulted in 12 compounds selected for follow-up testing. These compounds, selected from chemical stocks, were used to make the library plates, plated in 11-point concentration response format ranging from 38 \u03bcM to 37 nM, and confirmed off-line using the TR-FRET primary screen assay (   ). Offline testing confirmed 8 of the 12 actives identified in the primary screen. The 4 compounds that were not confirmed displayed curve class -4 and were active only at the highest concentration in the primary screen. These results provided another example of the value of qHTS format screening and the ability to use concentration-responsiveness as an early activity filter. The remaining active compounds were subjected to additional investigation using the TR-FRET-based counter screen assay to remove assay-interfering false positive compounds. Three compounds displayed unacceptable activity in the counter screen assay (same curve classification or maximum activity as the primary screen) and were removed from follow-up testing. The remaining compounds were then subjected to orthogonal assay testing using the AlphaScreen SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction assay and 5 were confirmed to have similar activity as in the primary screen. The chemical identities of the confirmed active compounds will be the subject of a follow-up report resulting from their ongoing characterization and optimization. \n   Large library screening workflow and results.  \nLeft panel: schematic of screening process showing input library size, assay utilization, advanced compounds (green arrow), and non-advanced compounds (red arrow).

Whereas several biologics (antibodies and decoy receptors) have been generated against CD47 and SIRP\u03b1, small molecule inhibitors of their interaction have yet to be described. Despite the advancement of several biologic-based CD47 inhibitors into clinical testing (Phase 1 and 2), small molecules have the potential to offer critical advantages in terms of ligand specificity (SIRP\u03b1 vs. TSP1 blockade), pharmacokinetic flexibility, tissue distribution, regulatory complexity, manufacturability, and cost. To enable the discovery, characterization and development of novel SIRP\u03b1-CD47 inhibiting small molecules, we sought to design a high-throughput screening platform capable of screening diverse small molecule libraries by first evaluating several different biochemical screening technologies coupled with recombinant SIRP\u03b1 and CD47 constructs. \n\nOur goal was to screen large chemical libraries (>100,000 molecules) in a concentration response format (qHTS), using 1536 well plates, and in a fully automated manner. Our choice of assay technologies reflects these parameters along with their history of use in conducting protein-protein interaction assays [ , ]. All three assay technologies were optimized to robust performance as evident in Z\u2019 factor and pilot screening performance. However, the ability to detect active compounds in library screening is a balance of statistical performance (Z\u2019 factor) and assay sensitivity (compound activity rate) [ ]. In this case, the optimized assays achieved robust statistical performance (Z\u2019 > 0.8) but displayed varying activity rates in LOPAC pilot screening (0.2% for LANCE TR-FRET and 1.1% for CisBio TR-FRET and AlphaScreen). Of these actives, none were confirmed as hits after counter and orthogonal testing. This result led us to hypothesize that the increased activity rates seen in the CisBio TR-FRET and AlphaScreen assays would lead to a greater accumulation of false positives in larger library primary screening. Accordingly, we chose the LANCE TR-FRET assay for primary screening as it offered the best balance of statistical robustness and low false positive rate. However, as pointed out in Inglese et al. [ ], these characteristics are likely to lead to a low sensitivity screening assay. As a predictor of sensitivity, the ratio of the observed positive control compound potency vs. the expected potency (IC50\u2019/IC50) of greater than 3-fold coupled with a high Z\u2019 factor (>0.5) is likely to lead to an insensitive screening assay mostly as a result of increased avidity of the binding partners being presented as multivalent reagents. In our case, we can infer an IC50\u2019/IC50 of 15, 5, and 2.8 for the CisBio, LANCE, and AlphaScreen assays respectively using the SIRP\u03b1-CD47   K   in     as   IC50   and the activity of \u201cSIRP\u03b1-cold\u201d in    . As the Z\u2019 factor for all assays was well above 0.5, predicted sensitivity would be borderline (AlphaScreen) to low (CisBio and LANCE) for our assays. This perhaps underlies the low activity rate observed in large drug-like library screening effort using the LANCE TR-FRET assay. In this study, the reduction of false positive activity was prioritized over total activity rate. \n\nAnother factor influencing the assay design and screening platform was the capability to efficiently identify assay-interfering compounds that are ubiquitous in large chemical libraries. Thus, to limit what is to be screened, we placed less emphasis on initial cheminformatic filtering and with it, potential filter bias and false negatives. Instead, we built a complementary set of primary and counter screening assays using data analyses to objectively exclude assay-interfering molecules from experimental actives. Many recent commentaries point out the overly simplistic and potentially counterproductive use of PAINS filters to triage libraries prior to screening [ \u2013 ]. As mentioned before [ ], it is important to have a strategy in place that can differentiate between compounds that are interfering with the assay technology (Type 1) or with the target via an undesirable mechanism (Type 2). In our case, the LANCE TR-FRET assay provided the most logical path to follow-up studies. As was previously pointed out, the ability to use high screening compound concentrations is an advantage of TR-FRET-based assays where compound interference is reduced by the lanthanide fluorescence lifetime and FRET read delay. This allows screening at high compound concentrations to reduce false negative occurrences without increasing false positives [ ]. Furthermore, in pilot and large library screening we integrated the LANCE TR-FRET primary screening assay together with the AlphaScreen assay as a follow-up orthogonal assay to catch Type 1 false positives, as well as counter screening assays in both the TR-FRET assay and AlphaScreen to catch Type 2 false positives. The decision to favor the LANCE assay over the CisBio assay is based on sensitivity versus false positive rate. While the CisBio assay appeared to be more sensitive (15 actives versus 3 for LANCE), only 1 of 15 actives was advanced for follow-up studies versus 1 out of 3 for LANCE. Based on this rate, the LANCE assay appeared less susceptible to assay interference during LOPAC screening. The decision to favor the LANCE technology over the AlphaScreen in primary screening was due to the more efficient advancement of compounds to follow-up as well as cost. To triage actives in the AlphaScreen, a second counter-screening assay was required to remove interfering compounds, thus increasing time and costs. One caveat to this is that the unique active compounds that were elucidated in the AlphaScreen and not the TR-FRET assays (   ) could be a more accurate set of actives. However, these were triaged by other undesirable characteristics such as Hill slope and reactivity/promiscuity. The AlphaScreen assay, as used in our format, has additional liabilities compared to the TR-FRET assays. These include the increased susceptibility to interference of the Ni -NTA to His-tag binding versus the anti-6His antibody on the TR-FRET assays, and the susceptibility to singlet oxygen quenching. Regardless, we would expect real hits derived from the TR-FRET assay to also be active in the AlphaScreen assay making it an excellent candidate for an orthogonal confirmatory assay. \n   Venn diagram of LOPAC active compounds in all screening assays.  \nGrey denotes compounds triaged in counter screening. Black denotes remaining active compounds. \n  \nThe value of combining these assays with a qHTS-formatted large library screen is evident in the example described herein. Multi-day fully-automated primary screening was robust and highly discriminatory and active compounds were efficiently triaged using confirmatory, counter screen, and orthogonal testing. Interestingly, all 5 confirmed compounds with similar potency displayed a greater maximum activity in the AlphaScreen assay than in the TR-FRET assay. This could point to a greater sensitivity of the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 PPI in the AlphaScreen assay than the TR-FRET assay perhaps due to the vast differences in size and diffusion of the protein-bound beads to the compounds\u2014something evident in the validation testing using SIRP\u03b1-cold and biotin as inhibitors.   In vivo  , the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction occurs between two adjacent cells, perhaps making the AlphaScreen assay a better model of their biological interaction than the lower valency TR-FRET assays. \n\nOur primary screen activity rate was very low (0.01%) but consistent with the challenges of targeting PPIs with traditional lead-like chemical libraries and assays with inherently low sensitivity due to multivalent reagents. However, it is important to point out the maximum capacity of these assays for efficient follow-up testing. Using an 11-point concentration response format, each 1536-well plate can accommodate 128 distinct compounds in intra-plate format. In a one-person day (8 hours) of offline testing, we tested up to 14 plates in each of the described assays. This translates to a throughput of at least 1792 compounds tested (formatted with intraplate controls) per day as follow-up or the ability to screen a 100,000-compound library and fully triage (confirm, counter, orthogonal) active compounds at a 2% hit rate in 7 testing days. This also critically depends on efficient and effective informatics and compound management support as is the case at the NCATS screening center. Using the assays as described supports the screening of larger and more diverse libraries with greater potential to result in successful PPI modulator identification. It will also permit the identification of more active compounds with relaxed chemical or activity criteria to more objectively assess their specificity and   lower false-negative rates   in unbiased/rapid/robust follow-up testing. For instance, increasing the number of compounds undergoing counter screening will provide valuable hard data to cross reference with predictions of assay interference activities to bolster efforts as discussed above [ ]. Concerning the low activity rate of screening typical lead-like chemical libraries for PPI modulators as exemplified herein, these assays could also serve as indispensable tools in the characterization and development of more potent active compounds obtained from screening libraries of greater molecular complexity like macrocycles or peptoids [ ] or more ligand efficient lead-like compounds derived from fragment screening campaigns [ ]. \n\nIn summary, we have developed and validated biochemical TR-FRET- and AlphaScreen-based assays for screening small molecule inhibitors of SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction. To our knowledge, these are the first HTS assays to target the SIRP\u03b1-CD47 PPI. These assays will be integrated into a platform capable of screening large drug-like chemical libraries to discover pre-therapeutic molecules as well as rank order lead candidates following medical chemistry optimization. Likewise, the process outlined herein from protein reagent creation to library screening is a viable approach to discover small molecule modulators for other emerging PPI targets. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6611588, "text_md5": "8486f51b85d697a01a461e8b1e87dcb0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 255], "journal": [256, 264], "publication_year": [266, 270], "title": [281, 397], "keywords": [411, 411], "abstract": [424, 2783], "body": [2792, 54074]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31276567, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0218897", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6611588", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6611588"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6611588\">6611588</a>", "list_title": "PMC6611588  Quantitative high-throughput screening assays for the discovery and development of SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction inhibitors"}

Top3\u03b2 represents a family of topoisomerases carrying activities for both DNA and RNA. Here we show that in   Drosophila  , Top3\u03b2 interacts biochemically and genetically with the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing AGO2, p68 RNA helicase, and FMRP.   Top3\u03b2   and RISC mutants are similarly defective in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing by position-effect variegation assay. Moreover, both   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants exhibit reduced levels of heterochromatin protein HP1 in heterochromatin. Furthermore, expression of several genes and transposable elements in heterochromatin is increased in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant. Notably,   Top3\u03b2   mutants defective in either RNA binding or catalytic activity are deficient in promoting HP1 recruitment and silencing of transposable elements. Our data suggest that Top3\u03b2 may act as an RNA topoisomerase in siRNA-guided heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. \n  \nTopoisomerases solve topological problems during DNA metabolism, but their role in RNA metabolism remains unclear.

Topoisomerase inactivation can lead to abnormal development, shortened lifespan, lethality, and human diseases . \n\nUnlike the well-characterized DNA topoisomerases, RNA topoisomerases have drawn little attention for many years. The first eukaryotic RNA topoisomerase, human Top3\u03b2, was discovered only recently . Since then, RNA topoisomerase activity has been observed in Type IA topoisomerases from all three domains of life . The prevalence of this activity implies that it can provide growth advantage to its host, so that it is retained through millions of years of evolution . The findings also indicate that many Type IA topoisomerases are dual-activity enzymes, capable of solving topological problems for both DNA and RNA. In human, only one of the two Type IA enzymes, Top3\u03b2, possesses dual activities, whereas its paralog, Top3\u03b1, contains only DNA activity. Top3\u03b2 but not Top3\u03b1 contains a conserved RNA-binding domain, RGG-box; and it strongly depends on this domain to bind mRNAs in cells, catalyze RNA topoisomerase reactions, and promote synapse formation . Top3\u03b2 has been purified in a complex with TDRD3 (Tudor domain-containing 3); and this complex biochemically and genetically interacts with FMRP , an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that is inappropriately silenced in Fragile X syndrome and known to modulate translation of mRNAs important for neurodevelopment and autism . Interestingly,   Top3\u03b2   gene mutation has been linked to schizophrenia and autism , suggesting that Top3\u03b2 and FMRP may work together to prevent mental dysfunction. Top3\u03b2 and FMRP bind common mRNAs, associate with mRNA translation machinery, and regulate gene expression at synapse . \n\nIn addition to regulating mRNA translation, FMRP also interacts with RNAi machinery to facilitate both transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements (TEs) in mammals and   Drosophila  . In   Drosophila  , FMRP has been purified as a component of an RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC), containing FMRP, Argonaute 2 (AGO2), p68 RNA helicase (encoded by   Rm62  ), Vig (an RBP), and Tudor-staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) . Mutations in RISC and other components of the RNAi machinery disrupt heterochromatic silencing of genes and TEs . \n\nHere we report the purification of the Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 complex from   Drosophila   S2 cells, and find that it stably associates with RISC. We demonstrate that   Top3\u03b2   mutants display defective heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing, which resemble RISC mutants. Moreover,   Top3\u03b2   genetically interacts with RISC to promote heterochromatic gene silencing and recruitment of heterochromatin protein HP1. Our data reveal a function for a dual-activity topoisomerase in RNA metabolism. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Drosophila   Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 complex associates with FMRP and RISC \n  \nWe used two different antibodies against   Drosophila   TDRD3 , and immunoprecipitated its complex with Top3\u03b2 from S2 cell lysates. Both antibodies (TDRD3-A and C) isolated two major polypeptides with about equal molar ratio, which were identified as TDRD3 and Top3\u03b2 by mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig.\u00a0 ) and immunoblotting (Fig.\u00a0 ). These results are identical to our previous findings for the human complex, and suggest that the complex is conserved in animals.   \nTop3\u03b2-TDRD3 stably associates with RISC in   Drosophila  .   a   Silver-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitated complexes of Top3\u03b2-TDRD3, FMRP, p68, and AGO2 from S2 cells; and a partial list of the number of peptides identified by MS analysis of each immunoprecipitate (bottom). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation are indicated on the top, which include two against TDRD3 (A and C), one for FMRP, and HA antibodies for tagged p68-isoforms (RE and RC) and AGO2. Top3\u03b2, TDRD3, components of RISC, and FMRP-associated proteins are indicated by arrows on top and by brackets at the bottom.   b   IP-Western confirms co-IP of Top3\u03b2-TDRD3 with different components of RISC by two TDRD3 antibodies.   c   Reciprocal IP-Western shows that Top3\u03b2-TDRD3 co-IPs with HA-tagged p68, VIG, and AGO2 using transfected S2 cells and HA antibodies. Note that the level of TDRD3 in each IP is higher than that of Top3\u03b2, which is consistent with the MS data \n  \n\nTo identify proteins that associate with the complex, we analyzed the entire TDRD3 immunoprecipitants by MS. We identified peptides from not only FMRP, but also other RISC components\u2014AGO2, p68, and VIG; as well as other FMRP-associated proteins (Fig.  ). However, the number of peptides derived from RISC were fewer than from either Top3\u03b2 or TDRD3; and with the exception of FMRP, RISC components were not detectable in the TDRD3 immunoprecipitate by silver-stained analysis. These data suggest that a minor fraction of Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 in cells associates with RISC. No peptides from p68 were detected in the immunoprecipitate of TDRD3-A antibody. This could be due to antibody disruption of their association, because this antibody was raised against the region of TDRD3 that binds p68 (see Figs.\u00a0  and \u00a0 ). It should be cautioned that although the number of peptides recovered from MS often reflect the protein abundance, they are not always reliable for quantitative comparisons between different samples. We therefore performed IP-Western, which confirmed the presence of several RISC components in TDRD3 immunoprecipitates (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data are consistent with our previous findings that Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 associates with FMRP in   Drosophila  , and further suggest that a fraction of Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 interacts with the FMRP-containing RISC.   \nTDRD3 acts as a scaffold linking   Drosophila   Top3\u03b2 to RISC.   a   A cartoon shows similarity and differences between human and   Drosophila   Top3\u03b2-TDRD3 complexes (see Results for details).   b   Summary of domain-mapping experiment to show different mutants of TDRD3 (left), and their interactions with Top3\u03b2 and components of RISC (right). The experiment was based on co-IP between different Flag-TDRD3 constructs and their interacting partners from transfected S2 cells. The detailed IP-Western data are in Supplemental figure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The presence (+), absence (\u2212), or reduction (down arrow), of interactions are indicated.   c   IP-Western shows that FLAG-Top3\u03b2 co-IPs with reduced amount of FMRP and p68 in S2 cells depleted with TDRD3 by RNAi. A control experiment was included using RNAi that targets GFP.   d   IP-Western shows that FMRP co-IPs with reduced amount of Top3\u03b2, but normal amount of p68, in S2 cells inactivated of TDRD3 by CRISPR \n  \n\nTo verify the association, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) by transfecting Flag-tagged Top3\u03b2, a Flag-Top3\u03b2 mutant deleted of its RGG-box, as well as Flag-TDRD3, into S2 cells; and immunoprecipitated the complex with the Flag antibody. MS detected the peptides from not only Top3\u03b2 and TDRD3, but also FMRP, AGO2, and p68 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). As a control, these RISC proteins were absent in mock-IP using the Flag antibody from S2 cells lacking Flag-Top3\u03b2 or Flag-TDRD3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The results indicate that the association between RISC and Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 is specific. \n\nWe investigated whether the observed association is mediated by RNA by IP\u2013MS using cell extracts untreated or treated with RNase A. We observed a 10-fold reduction in number of peptides derived from FMRP and p68 in TDRD3 IP from RNase A-treated than -untreated extracts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Similar reduction in RNase-treated extract was also observed in IP using Flag antibodies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These results differ from those of human studies, where RNase treatment has little effect on the association between Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 and FMRP , suggesting that the Top3\u03b2 complex may have diverged interactions and functions with RNA during evolution. We noted that in IP\u2013MS by Flag-Top3\u03b2 or Flag-Top3\u03b2-\u0394RGG mutant, the RNase treatment had no significant effect on the number of peptides derived from AGO2, even though the treatment completely eliminated the number of peptides from FMRP and p68 IP (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In IP\u2013MS by Flag-TDRD3 and the two TDRD3 antibodies, the number of AGO2 peptides was reduced by between 30 and 70%, which is smaller than the reduction of peptides from FMRP and p68 (about 90% or more). The data suggest that AGO2 may have direct protein\u2013protein interactions with Top3\u03b2 and/or TDRD3 that are not mediated by RNA. \n\n\n### A fraction of FMRP associates with RISC and Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 \n  \nWe next performed reciprocal IP\u2013MS with an FMRP antibody, and obtained three abundant polypeptides, which were identified as FMRP and its two known interactors, Caprin and Rin (Fig.\u00a0 ). MS analyses of the entire immunoprecipitate obtained peptides from RISC (AGO2, p68), Top3\u03b2 and TDRD3, supporting the notion that these proteins associate (Fig.  ; table). Because the number of peptides from RISC, TDRD3, and Top3\u03b2 were fewer than that of FMRP (about 5% or less), only a small fraction of FMRP may associate with RISC and Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3. \n\nWe also transfected epitope-tagged RISC components into S2 cells, and performed reciprocal IP with the antibody for the epitope. Silver-staining revealed TDRD3 as a minor polypeptide in the immunoprecipitates of two p68 isoforms (RE and RC) (Fig.\u00a0 ). MS identified peptides from RISC, as well as TDRD3 and Top3\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0 ; table). Immunoblotting further confirmed the presence of these proteins (Fig.\u00a0 ). We noted that a previous IP\u2013MS study detected Top3\u03b2 and TDRD3 in the immunoprecipitate of Flag-AGO2 from S2 cells . In addition, the   Drosophila   Protein Interaction Map (DPIM) project reported Top3\u03b2 and TDRD3 peptides in IP by tagged VIG. Consistent with these results, transfection of epitope-tagged-AGO2 and VIG into S2 cells followed by\u00a0IP-Western obtained TDRD3 (Fig.\u00a0 ). Overall, these data support the notion that a fraction of Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 associates with RISC. Because the number of TDRD3 peptides is higher than that of Top3\u03b2 in the immunoprecipitates of FMRP and p68 (about 3\u201310-fold) (Fig.\u00a0 ; table), RISC may have more direct interactions with TDRD3 than Top3\u03b2. \n\n\n###  Drosophila   TDRD3 acts as a scaffold linking Top3\u03b2 to RISC \n  \nHuman TDRD3 acts as a scaffold, interacting with Top3\u03b2 and FMRP with its N and C terminal domains, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ) . We studied whether   Drosophila   TDRD3 acts similarly by mutating different regions of Flag-TDRD3 (Fig.\u00a0 ), transfecting them into S2 cells, and testing their association with Top3\u03b2 and RISC by co-IP. First, we found that   Drosophila   TDRD3 was identical to its human homolog in requiring the same intervening loop within its OB-fold to associate with Top3\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; \u0394loop mutant). Second,   Drosophila   TDRD3 was similar to its human homolog in partial dependence on its Tudor domain for FMRP association (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; E772K mutant). However,   Drosophila   TDRD3 was independent of its C-terminal domain (CTD) for FMRP association (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; N790 (\u0394CTD)), whereas human TDRD3 was dependent . Interestingly, the FMRP-interacting motif (FIM) in human TDRD3-CTD was absent in   Drosophila   TDRD3-CTD. Instead, a region at the N-terminus of Tudor, named TYD motif, was found to have sequence similar to human FIM (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Deletion of this motif (\u0394TYD) reduced the amount of FMRP that co-IPs with Flag-TDRD3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that this motif could be the   Drosophila   FIM. Further mapping revealed that TDRD3 has another region that contributes to FMRP association (between 501 and 547) (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; see N500 and N547). These data suggest that TDRD3 in human and flies use different mechanisms to bind FMRP. \n\nWe mapped an AGO2-binding domain (ABD) to residues 501\u2013547 of TDRD3 (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), the same region that also contributes to FMRP association. This region is well conserved in TDRD3 from different fly species, but poorly in vertebrates (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). We also mapped a p68-binding domain (PBD) to residues between 281 and 440 (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). This region contains a LFDFL motif, which is conserved among TDRD3 homologs from flies to human (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), hinting that the association between Top3\u03b2\u2013TDRD3 and the RNA helicase may be conserved in animals. \n\nWe performed co-IP using   Drosophila   TDRD3-deficient cells , and found that Flag-Top3\u03b2 co-IPed with reduced amount of FMRP and p68 in TDRD3-depleted cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition, FMRP co-IPed with reduced amount of Top3\u03b2 but comparable amount of p68 in TDRD3-knockout cells (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data mimics the findings for human TDRD3 , and suggest that   Drosophila   TDRD3 acts as a scaffold linking Top3\u03b2 to FMRP and p68; but it is dispensable for FMRP\u2013p68 association. \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 and RISC promote heterochromatic gene silencing \n  \nRISC suppresses heterochromatic gene silencing in position effect variegation (PEV) assay . This prompted us to study if Top3\u03b2 functions similarly using the same assay (Fig.\u00a0 ). Briefly, a PEV reporter that encodes   white   gene and localizes near heterochromatin can result in variegated red eyes due to spreading of heterochromatin from regions nearby and subsequent transcriptional silencing in some but not all cells. Mutations in histone methyltransferase (  Su(var)3-9  ), RISC, and RNAi biogenesis enzyme   Dcr-2  , can dominantly suppress this phenotype by inhibiting heterochromatin spreading and gene silencing, leading to eyes with more red cells even uniform red eyes. Consistent with earlier reports, introducing a single mutant allele of   AGO2, Rm62   (encoding p68), or   Su(var)3-9  , into the   w   reporter line suppressed PEV as they produced uniform red eyes (Fig.\u00a0 , top). Importantly, introducing a single copy of any one of the three   Top3\u03b2   knockout alleles into this line produced similar uniform red eyes (Fig.\u00a0 , top; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that   Top3\u03b2   acts as a dominant suppressor of PEV as does RISC. As a negative control, introducing a wildtype   Top3\u03b2   allele in   w   white   eye mutant background into   w   line did not alter the eye phenotype (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ;   Top3\u03b2   mutants were derived from   w  ).   \n Top3\u03b2   and RISC mutants are similar in disrupting heterochromatic gene silencing by PEV assay.   a   A cartoon illustrates the PEV assay using   white   gene as reporters. See Results for description. The heterochromatin is marked by gray area, whereas HP1 is marked by green balls. HMT denotes histone methyltransferase.   b   Representative eye images show that   Top3\u03b2   is a suppressor of PEV similarly as are RISC components (  AGO2   and   p68/Rm62  ), and   Su(var)3-9  . Increased red color indicates suppression of silencing of   white   gene. Three   white   gene reporter lines were indicated on the left, with letters in parentheses indicating the chromosome with the reporter. Different mutant background is indicated on top.   w   serves as a negative control as   Top3\u03b2   was generated in its background.   c   A LacZ reporter-based PEV assay shows that   Top3\u03b2   mutant suppresses PEV similarly as does   Su(var)3-9   mutant. PEV suppression is indicated by increased blue color due to de-silencing of the LacZ.   Su(var)3-9   served as a positive control, whereas   w   as a negative control, as indicated on top.   d   Schematic representation summarizing the PEV modifications by   Top3\u03b2   mutants for reporters located on different chromosomes. Note that   Top3\u03b2   enhanced PEV for reporters in heterochromatin of chromosome 4, which is known to be different from those on heterochromatin \n  \n\nWe then introduced one   Top3\u03b2  -knockout allele into two additional reporter lines in which the   white   gene is located in different pericentric heterochromatin, and observed similar suppression of PEV (Fig.\u00a0 , middle and bottom). We further tested   Top3\u03b2   using PEV assays based on two non-  white   reporters,   LacZ   and   Sb  , which have a distinct location in heterochromatin compared to the   white   reporters. The advantage of the new reporters is that they can detect modifiers of PEV in tissues and developmental stages different from adult eyes. Notably, a   Top3\u03b2   knockout allele increased the reporter expression and thus suppressed PEV in both assays (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Together,   Top3\u03b2   mutation suppressed five PEV reporters in different heterochromatin regions and in different tissues (Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 may promote heterochromatic gene silencing throughout   Drosophila   development. \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 has no effect on post-transcriptional silencing \n  \nWe examined whether Top3\u03b2 can act like RISC in RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional silencing by using a reporter line that induces RNAi to post-transcriptionally silence the   white   gene expression, leading to white eye phenotype . We found that introducing   Top3\u03b2   mutant in the reporter line did not alter the white eye phenotype, whereas introducing the   Dcr-2   mutant produced uniform red eyes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 is dispensable for RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional silencing. The fact that   Top3\u03b2  -KO flies have normal post-transcriptional silencing also argue that the observed effect of   Top3\u03b2   on heterochromatic gene silencing in PEV assay is not due to defective RNAi biogenesis. \n\n\n###  Top3\u03b2   and RISC genetically interact in PEV assay \n  \nWe next investigated if   Top3\u03b2   and RISC genetically interact to suppress PEV by epistasis analysis. We chose the 39C-2 as the reporter, because PEV suppression in this line by   Top3\u03b2   mutant generated about 50% of red cells, suitable for detecting either a suppressor or enhancer by the second mutation (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \n Top3\u03b2   and RISC genetically interact to promote heterochromatin gene silencing by PEV assay.   a   Representative eye images show suppression of PEV reporter 39C-2 by heterozygous mutant of   Top3\u03b2  .   b   Representative eye images (left), and pigment quantification assay (right), show that double heterozygous mutants of   Top3\u03b2  ;   AGO2   enhanced PEV (white eyes) for the 39C-2 reporter line.   c   Same as   b  , except that mutants of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO1   were analyzed.   d   Same as   a  , except that   Top3\u03b2   and   Rm62   mutants were analyzed.   e   Same as   b  , except   Top3\u03b2   and   Fmr1   mutants were analyzed.   f   Same as   b  , except that   Top3\u03b2   and   Dcr-2   mutants were analyzed. Several images of control and single heterozygous mutants were copied from Fig.\u00a0  for the convenience of readers. The asterisks in graphs mark   p  -values less than 0.05 by Student   T  -test. n.s. represents statistically non-significant   p   values (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). The error bars are obtained by standard error method. The results are obtained from three independent experiments \n  \n\nFirst, the introduction of the double heterozygous mutant of   Top3\u03b2   ;AGO2   into 39C-2 line enhanced PEV, evidenced by a decrease of the percentage of red cells and appearance of the white eye (Fig.\u00a0 ). This result contrasts with those of their single heterozygous mutants, which produce more red cells and thus suppression of PEV (Fig.\u00a0 ). Extraction of the eye pigment and subsequent measurement confirmed that the red color was decreased in the double but increased in each single mutant (Fig.  , right graph). These data suggest that   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   interact genetically during heterochromatic silencing. We also analyzed interactions between   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO1  , which is a homolog of   AGO2   but functions in the miRNA pathway. We found that the   Top3\u03b2   ;AGO1   double mutant suppressed PEV similarly as the   AGO1   single mutant did (Fig.\u00a0 ). This result differs from that of the   Top3\u03b2   ;AGO2   mutant that enhanced PEV, indicating that the genetic interaction between   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   is specific. \n\nSecond, the introduction of   Top3\u03b2   ;Rm62   double heterozygous mutant into the reporter line enhanced PEV (Fig.\u00a0 ). This phenotype differs from that of their respective single mutants, but resembles that of   Top3\u03b2   ;AGO2   double mutant, suggesting that   Top3\u03b2   genetically interacts with both   AGO2   and   Rm62   in heterochromatin silencing. \n\nThird, the introduction of   Top3\u03b2   ;Fmr1   double mutant into 39C-2 line suppressed PEV similarly as their respective single mutants (Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that   Fmr1   does not have the same genetic interactions with   Top3\u03b2   as   AGO2   and   Rm62   do, and that the function of FMRP in RISC is different from that of the other two proteins. \n\nFourth, the introduction of   Top3\u03b2   ;Dcr-2   double mutant into the reporter line enhanced PEV (Fig.\u00a0 ). This phenotype differs from their respective single mutants, but mimics those of   Top3\u03b2   ;AGO2   and   Top3\u03b2   ;Rm62   double mutants. These results support a model that siRNAs produced by Dcr-2 form complexes with AGO2, and these siRNA-loaded RISC complexes genetically interact with   Top3\u03b2   to promote heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. \n\n\n### Heterochromatin is abnormal in   Top3\u03b2   mutant flies \n  \nRISC mutants have aberrant cellular distribution of heterochromatin markers, including HP1 and H3K9me2 . We analyzed these markers by immunostaining salivary glands of the   Top3\u03b2   mutant. In agreement with previous data , both markers displayed concentrated staining in the control flies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), which are due to clustering of pericentric heterochromatin of different chromosomes. Notably, both markers showed less concentrated staining in   Top3\u03b2   mutant. As a control, histone H3 showed similar staining in both mutant and the control flies. Quantification confirmed that the ratios between the signals of HP1 or H3K9me2 versus that of H3 were reduced in   Top3\u03b2   mutant. Immunoblotting revealed that   Top3\u03b2   mutant had normal levels of the two markers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that   Top3\u03b2   mutation does not affect HP1 synthesis or global H3K9 methylation. Together, the results imply that   Top3\u03b2   mutation may disrupt HP1 recruitment and H3K9 methylation in pericentric heterochromatin, which is consistent with the PEV data. \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 and RISC promote HP1 recruitment to heterochromatin \n  \nWe next performed HP1 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) to identify the defective heterochromatin in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants at the molecular level. Our analyses were focused on chromosomes 2 and 3, because their pericentric heterochromatin is long and distinguishable from euchromatin. \n\nConsistent with earlier reports , the ChIP signals of HP1 were enriched in pericentric heterochromatin in control and   Top3\u03b2   mutant flies, after normalization with their respective input signals (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , top). We then calculated the difference in HP1 signals between each mutant and the control (  w  ) using the SICER (Spatial-clustering method for Identification of CHIP-Enriched Regions) program, and displayed the HP1-decreased islands (HDIs) and HP1-increased islands (HIIs) by blue or red lines, respectively, in bedgraphs. The analysis revealed much more HDIs (blue) than HIIs (red) in pericentric heterochromatin of both   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). There was also an HDI at telomeric heterochromatin of chromosome 3L (Fig.\u00a0 ). Bedgraphs of sequencing reads in 100-bp windows across two telomeric and one representative pericentric heterochromatin regions revealed that many HP1 peaks present in the control flies are concomitantly reduced in both   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants (Fig.\u00a0 ), which is consistent with the SICER data and suggests that Top3\u03b2 and RISC can work together to recruit HP1 to the same loci. The reduction of HP1 signals was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR for two representative pericentric heterochromatin loci (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nTop3\u03b2 works with AGO2 to facilitate HP1 recruitment to specific loci in heterochromatin.   a   Bedgraphs displaying HP1 SICER score difference (  Y  -axis) on chromosome 3 between the single or double mutants of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   versus the control (  w  ). The   X  -axis indicates chromosome location of the HP1 islands on dm6 version of   Drosophila   genome. The HP1-decreased and increased islands (HDIs and HIIs) are marked by blue and red, respectively. An arrow indicates an HDI in 3L telomeric region. The chromosome bands indicate pericentric heterochromatin (black) from euchromatin (striped).   b  \u2013  d   The bedgraphs of HP1 ChIP-seq reads in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of genome per Million mapped reads) in representative regions of chromosome 3L telomere (  b  ), 3R telomere (  c  ), and 3L pericentromeric region (  d  ) for the single and double mutants of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2  , and the control. Blue and red arrows indicate reduced and increased HP1 signals in the mutants, respectively. Window width is 100\u2009bp for the calculation. The bottom two panels of   b  \u2013  d   show Top3\u03b2 and FLAG-AGO2 ChIP-seq signals in the same locus. Note that anti-FLAG antibodies were used for ChIP-seq experiment in a fly line with a Flag-tag knocked-in at the AGO2 gene. The green arrows indicate the overlap between AGO2, Top3\u03b2, and reduced HP1 peaks. The error bars represent standard errors.   e   A graph shows the percentage of HP1 islands that are decreased (blue), increased (red), or no change (gray) of chromosomes 2 and 3 for each mutant compared to the control. The quantification is based on average of SICER scores from 3 independent ChIP experiments for   Top3\u03b2  , 2 for   AGO2  , and 2 for   Top3\u03b2/AGO2   mutants.   f   A Venn diagram shows mean percentages of HDIs in total pericentric heterochromatin of chromosomes 2 and 3 for single   Top3\u03b2   or   AGO2   mutant only. The quantification is based on SICER scores.   g   Venn diagrams show the overlap of ChIP islands and the total length of these islands between HP1 and AGO2 (top), and Top3\u03b2 (bottom) in pericentric heterochromatin of chromosomes 2 and 3 of the   w   line. The quantification is based on the length from the SICER analysis \n    \nTop3\u03b2 promotes H3K9 methylation and HP1 recruitment in heterochromatin.   a   Bedgraphs show differences of SICER scores of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 ChIP-seq data between   Top3\u03b2   mutant versus the control (  w  ) for chromosome 3 (  Y  -axis). Islands with decreased and increased signals are marked by blue and red, respectively.   b   A graph shows the percentage of H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 islands that are decreased (blue), increased (red), or of no change (gray) in heterochromatin (Het) or euchromatin (Eu) of   Top3\u03b2   mutant when compared to the control. The quantification is based on SICER analysis from 3 independent ChIP experiments.   c   A graph shows the ratio of islands with decreased over those with increased signals of HP1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 in heterochromatin (red) and euchromatin (blue) of   Top3\u03b2   mutant when compared to the control. The quantification for HP1 is based on 3 ChIP-seq experiments.   d  ,   e   Bedgraphs of ChIP-seq data (left) and graphs of RT-qPCR (right) show that two representative pericentric heterochromatin regions on chromosome 3L and 2R have decreased signals of HP1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 in   Top3\u03b2   mutant when compared to the control. The red box marks the region in which 2 primer pairs for qRT-PCR were selected. A pair of control primers was selected from the euchromatin of the corresponding chromosomes. The results of RT-qPCRs were from triplicates. The error bars are obtained by standard error method \n  \n\n\n### More defective HP1 recruitment in   AGO2   than   Top3\u03b2   mutant \n  \nWe observed that in pericentric heterochromatin, there are more HDIs in   AGO2   than   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition, the height of HP1 peaks was reduced to a greater extent in the   AGO2   than   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These data suggest that the effect of RISC on HP1 recruitment is stronger than that of Top3\u03b2. \n\nQuantification further revealed the differential effects of the two mutants on HP1 recruitment. First, the sum of HDIs represent 23.6% and 43.3% of all HP1 islands in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants, respectively; which are about 500- and 100-fold higher than the percentages of HIIs (0.04% and 0.4%, Fig.\u00a0 ), respectively; indicating that the predominant effect of Top3\u03b2 and RISC on heterochromatin is to increase HP1 recruitment. However, over 55% of HP1 islands showed no change in either mutant, arguing that Top3\u03b2 and RISC are necessary for recruiting HP1 to some but not all loci. Second, the sum of HDIs accounted for 13.6% and 37.0% of the entire length of pericentric heterochromatin in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ), consistent with the SICER bedgraphs showing more HDIs in   AGO2   than   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Of all the HDIs, 3.6% was present in   Top3\u03b2   mutant only, 27% in   AGO2   mutant only, whereas 10% were present in both (Fig.\u00a0 ). The HDIs present in both mutants represented 74% and 27% of the total HDIs in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants, respectively. The data suggest that a large fraction of Top3\u03b2 and a small fraction of RISC may work together to recruit HP1 to the same loci, whereas a small fraction of Top3\u03b2 and majority of RISC can act independently to recruit HP1. \n\n\n###  Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   genetically interact for HP1 recruitment \n  \nTo study whether   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   genetically interact in pericentric heterochromatin formation as suggested by PEV data, we analyzed their double mutant by HP1 ChIP-seq. The number of HDIs (blue) in pericentric heterochromatin was fewer in the double mutant than those of their single mutants (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition, many HP1 peaks reduced in each single mutant were not reduced in the double mutant (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Quantification of SICER data showed that while HDIs in each single mutant accounted for >20% of total HP1 islands, the corresponding percentage in the double mutant was 1.2%, a decrease of 20-fold or more (Fig.\u00a0 ). Concomitantly, the percentage of HP1 islands of no change was increased in the double mutant (98.6%) when compared to their single mutants (76.4% and 56.3%). Moreover, the ratio between HDIs and HIIs is about 6 for the double mutant, which is considerably smaller than those of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   single mutants (about 500 and 100, respectively) (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data suggest that the defective heterochromatin phenotype is largely suppressed in the double mutant. The data are reminiscent of those of the PEV assay (Fig.  ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 and RISC genetically interact to promote HP1 recruitment to pericentric heterochromatin. \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2, AGO2, and HP1 binding sites overlap in heterochromatin \n  \nIf Top3\u03b2 and RISC directly promote HP1 recruitment, their binding sites on chromatin may overlap with those of HP1. To test this hypothesis, we identified genome-wide Top3\u03b2 and AGO2 binding sites in fly heads by ChIP-seq. For AGO2 ChIP, we utilized a fly line that has a Flag-tag knocked-in and fused in-frame to the endogenous   AGO2  . SICER analysis showed that AGO2 and Top3\u03b2 ChIP islands are present in heterochromatin at much lower frequency and scores than those of HP1 (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ; HP1 islands used a scale 100-fold higher than the others). Specifically, the percentages of AGO2 and Top3\u03b2 ChIP islands in total heterochromatin were about 0.3% and 1.4%, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ), which are substantially smaller than that of HP1 (72%), as well as that of HDIs in total heterochromatin of   AGO2   and   Top3\u03b2   mutants (37% and 13.6%, respectively; Fig.  ). The data are consistent with a mechanism of \u201cnucleation and spreading \u201d: RISC and Top3\u03b2 may bind a small number of loci to nucleate the initial assembly of heterochromatin, which may then recruit additional components to spread to other regions. \n\nInterestingly, almost all AGO2 islands (98%) in pericentric heterochromatin overlap with those of HP1 (Fig.\u00a0 ), supporting a role of chromatin-bound RISC in HP1 recruitment. In contrast, a much smaller percentage of Top3\u03b2 islands (8%) overlap with those of HP1 (Fig.\u00a0 ) or AGO2 (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 ), arguing that a minor fraction of chromatin-bound Top3\u03b2 may be involved in the same process. Inspection of selected regions in heterochromatin revealed that some HP1-reduced peaks in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants overlap with AGO2 and Top3\u03b2 binding sites (Fig.\u00a0 ), supporting the notion that RISC and Top3\u03b2 work together to promote HP1 recruitment. \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 and AGO2 recruit HP1 to some loci in euchromatin \n  \nOur HP1 ChIP assay detected a small number of HDIs and HIIs in euchromatin of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Notably, the percentage of HDIs (1.3\u20132.1%) was about 40\u201350-fold higher than HIIs (0.03\u20130.04%) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 and RISC can also promote HP1 recruitment to euchromatin, albeit at fewer loci than heterochromatin. Some HDIs were concomitantly present in single and double mutants of   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 and RISC may work in the same pathway in HP1 recruitment at these loci. In agreement with this notion, a fraction of AGO2 and Top3\u03b2 ChIP islands were found to overlap with those of HP1 and each other in euchromatin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ); and inspection of representative euchromatin regions revealed that some AGO2 and Top3\u03b2 binding sites overlap with HP1-reduced peaks in   Top3\u03b2   and   AGO2   mutants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWe noticed that majority of Top3\u03b2 and AGO2 ChIP islands are localized in euchromatin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). This is in contrast to HP1 islands, most of which are in heterochromatin, implying that majority of Top3\u03b2 and RISC have functions in euchromatin that are unrelated to HP1 recruitment. Indeed, only a minor fraction (16%) of AGO2 islands overlap with those of HP1 in euchromatin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), which is much smaller than the 98% observed in heterochromatin, consistent with previous findings that AGO2 can function independent of HP1 recruitment . \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 promotes H3K9 methylation \n  \nHP1 is known to bind H3K9me3 in heterochromatin. Our data that H3K9me2 immunostaining is reduced in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant prompted us to investigate whether H3K9 methylation is decreased in pericentric heterochromatin by ChIP-seq. We observed enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in pericentric heterochromatin, which is similar to that of HP1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). SICER analysis revealed more decreased (blue) than increased (red) islands for both methylation marks in pericentric heterochromatin of the   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that Top3\u03b2 is needed for normal H3K9 methylation in heterochromatin. The percentages of islands with decreased H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 signals were 7.0% and 4.6%, respectively, among all their respective islands (Fig.\u00a0 ), which are about 18- and 23-fold higher than percentages of the islands with increased signals (0.4% and 0.2%, respectively; Fig.\u00a0 ). These differences are smaller than that of HP1 (~500-fold) (Fig.\u00a0 ), suggesting that Top3\u03b2 is more important for HP1 recruitment than H3K9 methylation. \n\nWe then selected two representative loci from pericentric heterochromatin of 3L and 2R based on the presence of HDIs (Fig.\u00a0 ; left), and found that both loci exhibited concomitant reduction of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 signals by bedgraph analyses and ChIP-qPCR (Fig.\u00a0 ; right). Together, these data suggest that Top3\u03b2 is needed for HP1 recruitment and H3K9 methylation at the same loci in heterochromatin. \n\nWe observed smaller changes in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 islands in euchromatin when compared to those in heterochromatin (Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The ratios between the percentages of decreased and increased islands are 0.7 and 1.1 (Fig.\u00a0 ), respectively, which are considerably smaller than the 18- and 23-fold ratios for the two marks in heterochromatin (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data suggest that the major effect of Top3\u03b2 on HP1 recruitment and H3K9 methylation is in heterochromatin. \n\n\n###  Top3\u03b2   mutant displays defective transcriptional silencing \n  \nAs defective heterochromatin formation often leads to defective silencing of genes and TEs , we investigated whether   Top3\u03b2   mutant has this defect at several heterochromatin loci where HP1 level is reduced. In the telomeric region of chromosome 3L, three neighboring genes (  Lsp1\u03b3  , CG13405, and   mthl8  ) were found to be upregulated by RNA-seq, microarray assays (Fig.\u00a0 ), and RT-qPCR (Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition, seven TEs located between   mthl8   and   Lsp1\u03b3   were also found to be upregulated in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0 ). As a control, a gene located outside of this locus (  pk61c  ) showed no obvious change. Similarly, in the telomeric region of chromosome X, two neighboring genes were upregulated (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR revealed that two TEs located in pericentric heterochromatin,   Doc   and   gypsy1  , are consistently de-silenced in   Top3\u03b2   mutant flies (Fig.\u00a0 ). Together, these data support our PEV data that Top3\u03b2 is needed for transcriptional silencing.   \nTop3\u03b2 is required for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing at telomeres.   a   Bedgraphs of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and cDNA microarray data show reduced HP1 signals and increased gene expression in the telomeric region of chromosome 3L. Arrows in the ChIP-seq bedgraph indicate the regions with reduced HP1 signals in   Top3\u03b2   mutant when compared to the control (  w  ). The bedgraphs of RNA-seq and cDNA microarray used   z  -ratios (  y  -axis) to show the difference in transcript levels between the   Top3\u03b2   mutant and the control for several neighboring genes in this region. The increased and decreased RNA signals in   Top3\u03b2   mutant are marked by red (increase) and blue (decrease), respectively. The chromosome location of genes and TEs are indicated at the bottom graph.   b  ,   c   Graphs of RT-qPCR data show de-silencing of the genes (  b  ) and TEs (  c  ) in chromosome 3L telomere as listed in   a  . A negative control gene (  pk61c  ) was included, which is located outside of the HP1-decreased region.   d   Bedgraphs of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data show reduced HP1 signals and increased the levels of TEs in chromosome 2R (left) and chromosome X (right) pericentric heterochromatin regions. The red arrows indicate decreased HP1 ChIP signals in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant.   e   Graphs of RT-qPCR data show de-silencing of TEs expression. RT-qPCR was performed in triplicates and TE levels were measured by normalizing with   rp49  . The error bars are obtained by standard error method \n  \n\n\n### Top3\u03b2 function requires RNA binding and catalytic activity \n  \nWe have previously shown that Top3\u03b2 depends on both its RNA binding and catalytic activities to promote synapse formation using transgenic rescue experiment . Here we used the same strategy to study whether Top3\u03b2 depends on the same activities to mediate heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. Briefly, we transgenically expressed in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant background the wildtype and two mutant versions of Top3\u03b2-a catalytic point mutant (Y332F) that contains normal mRNA binding activity but lacks topoisomerase activity for both DNA and mRNA, and an RGG box-deletion mutant (\u0394RGG) that has strongly reduced mRNA binding, as well as decreased topoisomerase activity for both nucleic acids (Fig.\u00a0 ) . ChIP assays revealed that the reduced HP1 levels at the two representative loci in pericentric heterochromatin in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant (Fig.\u00a0 ) were rescued by the wildtype but not two mutants of Top3\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition,   Top3\u03b2   wildtype transgene increased HP1 signals at a telomeric locus of X chromosome to a level that is higher than that of the control line, whereas its two mutants were defective (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data suggest that Top3\u03b2 depends on both RNA-binding and catalytic activities to promote HP1 recruitment to specific loci in heterochromatin.   \nTop3\u03b2 depends on both RNA-binding and catalytic activity to recruit HP1 to specific loci in heterochromatin and silence TEs.   a   Western blotting of Top3\u03b2 complementation in fly heads. Each transgene (listed in   b  ) was expressed by actin-gal4 driver in   Top3\u03b2   mutant background.   b   Schematic representation of the wildtype, the catalytic point mutant (Y332F), and the RGG-box deletion mutant (\u0394RGG) of Top3\u03b2 protein and their biochemical activities. The presence, absence, and reduction (arrow) of the activity are indicated.   c   Bedgraphs display HP1 ChIP-seq data at a representative locus in chromosome 3L pericentric region from the control flies (  w  ),   Top3\u03b2   mutant   (Top3\u03b2  ), and the transgenic flies (  Top3\u03b2  ,   Top3\u03b2  ,   and Top3\u03b2  ) that express wildtype and two mutants of   Top3\u03b2  , in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant background. The red box indicates the region selected for ChIP-qPCR analyses of HP1. The right graph shows the validation of the ChIP-seq by ChIP-qPCR analysis.   d   Same as   c   except that the representative locus is from pericentric heterochromatin of chromosome 2R. Note that the reduction of HP1 ChIP signals are significantly decreased in   Top3\u03b2   as compared to control, and also in mutant complementation as compared to   Top3\u03b2   complementation (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05).   e   Bedgraphs displaying FPKM of ChIP-seq data show that HP1 signals are increased in   Top3\u03b2  complemented   Top3\u03b2   mutant in the telomere locus in chromosome X. The graphs on the right panel represent ChIP qRT-PCR of the respective locus. Note that wildtype   Top3\u03b2   transgene (  Top3\u03b2  ) resulted in the increase of HP1 recruitment in   Top3\u03b2   mutant in chromosome X telomere, whereas the catalytic mutant and RNA binding mutant transgenes induced lower levels of HP1 as compared to   Top3\u03b2  .   f   A graph showing RT-qPCR of TE expression level in the control (  w  ),   Top3\u03b2  ,   Top3\u03b2  ,   Top3\u03b2  ,   and Top3\u03b2   complemented mutant. RT-qPCR was performed in quadruplicates and TE levels were measured by normalizing with   rp49  . Statistics in   c  \u2013  f  : \u201cn.s.\u201d indicates difference that is statistically not significant (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05); and asterisks indicate statistically significant difference with   p  -values less than 0.05 by Student   T  -test. The error bars represent standard errors \n  \n\nWe also found that the two TEs de-silenced in the   Top3\u03b2   mutant (  Doc   and   gypsy1  , Fig.\u00a0 ) were largely repressed by transgenic expression of the wildtype Top3\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, this repression was reduced by transgenic expression of the two mutant proteins (Fig.\u00a0 ). These data suggest that Top3\u03b2 depends on its RNA-binding and catalytic activities for transcriptional silencing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nRecent evidence suggests that Top3\u03b2 has two functions: one for DNA, where it reduces negative supercoiling to resolve R-loops ; and the other for mRNAs, where it associates with polyribosomes and FMRP to regulate translation . Here we show that Top3\u03b2 has an additional function\u2014it interacts with RISC to facilitate heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. Because Top3\u03b2 is a dual-activity enzyme, one key question is whether it acts on DNA or RNA during this process. Our findings that   Top3\u03b2   mutant deleted of its RNA-binding domain (RGG-box) is deficient in promoting HP1 recruitment to heterochromatin and in silencing of TEs suggest that Top3\u03b2 acts on RNA. This notion is further supported by the data that Top3\u03b2 biochemically and/or genetically interacts with an RNA slicer (AGO2), an RNA helicase (p68), and an RNase (Dcr-2). However, because the RGG-box deletion mutant not only has defective RNA-binding activity, but also reduced catalytic activity for both DNA and RNA, it is possible that the reduced catalytic activity on either DNA, or RNA, or both, is responsible for the defective heterochromatin formation. A mutation that inactivates the catalytic activity of Top3\u03b2 on one nucleic acid but not the other is needed to clarify this issue. \n\nAnother question is whether Top3\u03b2 acts as a topoisomerase or an RNA-binding protein. Our findings that   Top3\u03b2  -Y332F mutant, which has normal RNA binding but no catalytic activity, is deficient in promoting HP1 recruitment and TE silencing suggest that Top3\u03b2 acts as a topoisomerase. The next question is where the topological problem may come from? The current hypothesis on heterochromatin formation postulates that siRNA-loaded RISC may guide histone methyltransferases and HP1 to their targets by base-pairing interactions with nascent RNAs transcribed from the heterochromatin locus . We predict that this process may produce RNA topological problems at some loci, which depend on Top3\u03b2 to resolve. Possibly, the nascent RNA may generate complex structures by: base-pairing with itself, or other RNAs, or DNA. These structures may prevent the nascent RNAs from being base-paired by the siRNA-loaded RISC, so they need to be resolved by the topoisomerase activity of Top3\u03b2. \n\nHow may Top3\u03b2 solve RNA topological problems during RISC-mediated heterochromatin formation? One RISC component that interacts with Top3\u03b2 is the p68 RNA helicase, which interacts with histone methyltransferase and is needed for heterochromatic gene silencing . The biochemical and genetic interactions between a Type IA topoisomerase and helicase have been similarly observed for Top3\u03b1 and BLM: their enzymatic activities are coupled to resolve complex DNA structures . Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that Top3\u03b2 and p68 may employ a mechanism mimicking their DNA counterpart\u2014their enzymatic activities may be coupled to resolve complex RNA structures during heterochromatin formation (Fig.\u00a0 ). p68 may unwind secondary structures in nascent RNA transcribed at heterochromatin. This unwinding may generate topological stress, which may be relieved by Top3\u03b2 to enable p68 to continue the unwinding reaction, making nascent RNA accessible to binding by siRNA-loaded RISC, and enabling subsequent recruitment of histone methyltransferases and HP1. When either p68 or Top3\u03b2 is mutated, this process is defective, leading to defective heterochromatin, and increased   white   gene expression in PEV assay. However, this hypothesis is difficult to explain why the double mutant between   Rm62   and   Top3\u03b2   exhibits suppression of the PEV phenotype observed in each single mutant. We speculate that when both p68 and Top3\u03b2 are mutated, alternative pathways may be activated to form heterochromatin. One alternative pathway may be mediated by PIWI , which can interact with FMRP to promote heterochromatin silencing in somatic cells . Future work is needed to show whether activities of Top3\u03b2 and p68 are coupled, and to identify the alternative pathway(s).   \nTop3\u03b2 promotes heterochromatin formation by interacting with RNAi machinery. A model illustrating how Top3\u03b2 works with RISC in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. The nascent RNA transcribed from heterochromatin may form secondary and other structures by base-pairing with itself, which prevents access by siRNA-loaded RISC. These RNA structures are unwound by p68 helicase of RISC, and this process may produce torsional stress. Top3\u03b2 may relieve this stress by facilitating the unwinding process and makes nascent RNA accessible to base pairing by siRNA-loaded RISC. Binding of RISC to the nascent RNA may recruit HP1 and H3K9 methyltransferases to assemble heterochromatin. The coordinated actions of p68-Top3\u03b2 in resolving complex RNA structures may resemble those of their homologs, BLM-Top3\u03b1, in resolving complex DNA structures \n  \n\nFinally, our findings that Top3\u03b2 depends on both RNA binding and catalytic activities for recruiting HP1 and silencing TEs are reminiscent of our previous data that Top3\u03b2 requires the same two activities to promote synapse formation , suggesting that these Top3\u03b2-mediated processes may be connected. Indeed, misregulation of heterochromatin and TEs has been linked to abnormal brain development, schizophrenia, other neurological disorders , and aging . Notably, individuals carrying   Top3\u03b2   mutations have increased risks of schizophrenia and other mental disorders ; and   Top3\u03b2   mutant animals exhibit abnormal neurodevelopment and shortened lifespan . Thus, regulation of heterochromatin formation and transcription silencing could be one mechanism used by Top3\u03b2 to prevent mental dysfunction and shortened lifespan. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n###  Drosophila   stocks and genetics \n  \nFlies were cultured on corn syrup-soy recipe food from Archon Scientific at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C and 60\u2009\u00b1\u20095% humidity, under a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light/dark cycle, except for the PEV assay, which was performed at 22\u2009\u00b0C.

Injection of the gRNA expressing plasmids was performed by Thebestgene injection service ( ). The screened and sequence verified   AGO2   line contains a 630\u2009bp deletion in the promoter region and a 7\u2009bp-deletion in exon 6, creating a null-allele.   Top3\u03b2   transgenic lines   UAS-Top3\u03b2   , UAS-Top3\u03b2  , and   UAS-Top3\u03b2   were described previously .

Tagged expression constructs (Flag full-length TDRD3, TDRD3-N250, N440, N500, N547, N720, \u0394CTD, 251C, 441C, 501C, 548C, \u0394loop, \u0394UBA, \u0394241-440, \u0394501-546, \u0394TYD, E772K, Flag-Top3\u03b2, Flag-Top3\u03b2-\u0394RGG, HA-p68, HA-VIG, HA-AGO2) were cloned in pMT/V5 vector according to standard cloning procedure. The genomic layouts of the constructs are pictured in Fig.\u00a0 . Transfection of plasmids and siRNAs were carried out with the Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. IP and MS were performed using our published protocol . \n\nThe immunoprecipitated eluates were analyzed by standard Western blot analysis. Rabbit TDRD3 and Top3\u03b2 antibodies (produced in-house)  were used in 1:1000 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively. \u03b1-FMRP antibody was obtained from abcam (ab10299) and used in a 1:1000 dilution. Guinea pig \u03b1-p68 antibody (1:3000) was a kind gift from A. Spradling . Mouse \u03b1-AGO2 serum (1:1) was a kind gift from M. Siomi . Uncropped images for Western blotting data are included in Supplemental Figure\u00a0 . \n\n\n### ChIP-seq and ChIP RT-qPCR \n  \nChIP and ChIP-seq library generation was carried out by standard protocols . Fly heads (100\u2009\u03bcl) were isolated from fast freeze and sieving. The antibodies used are: HP1\u2014Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) C1A9; H3K9me2\u2014Abcam ab1220; H3K9me3\u2014Abcam ab8898; FLAG\u2014Sigma-Aldrich F7425; Top3\u03b2\u2014our own group . The homogenized and cleared samples were sonicated to a length between 200 and 500\u2009bp. The sheared chromatin was precleared with Protein A beads (GE Healthcare 17-1279-01, Waukesha, WI, USA), and then incubated with 5\u2009\u03bcl of each of the above antibodies and 30\u2009\u03bcl of Protein A beads at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. After thorough washing, the samples were eluted by 10% SDS and Protease K at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 8\u2009h. The eluted chromatin was extracted by phenol\u2013chloroform clean-up followed by ethanol precipitation. For RT-qPCR, 2\u2009\u03bcl of 10\u00d7 diluted chromatin was used for 20\u2009\u03bcl reaction using ABI7800HT. Given the reaction was run in triplicate, the threshold values (Ct) were converted to fold change difference in standard delta Ct method. The primers used in the analysis are in Supplemental Table\u00a0 . \n\nChIP-seq libraries were sequenced by the Hi-Seq 2000 at 50 bases. Reads were mapped to the dm6 fly genome with Bowtie  allowing maximum of 2 mismatches. Non-unique reads with 2 or 3 hits in the genome were assigned weights of 1/2 or 1/3, respectively. Reads with >3 hits in the genome were not counted. The frequency of reads was calculated in 100-bp intervals across the genome in FPKM units. As a control, we used total DNA input samples for the same line of flies (  w   or mutants), that were processed in the same way as the ChIP-seq samples. Input-subtracted positive ChIP-seq frequencies were visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser . For Flag-AGO2 ChIP analysis, the background noises were removed by subtracting Flag ChIP-seq signals from   w   control flies which do not express any Flag-tagged proteins. This subtraction is necessary because Flag ChIP-seq produces high background signals, which interfere with the real Flag-AGO2 ChIP signals. It is known that highly expressed loci are non-specific \u201chotspots\u201d for ChIP-seq that may lead to misleading localization of proteins on chromatin by this technique . A large amount of Flag-ChIP signals from   w   control line are from transcription start sites of active genes in euchromatin, so that they are likely derived from the non-specific \u201chotspots\u201d. \n\nFor SICER analysis, the ChIP-seq results are quantitated by SICER 1.1 against   Drosophila   genome version dm6, with windows of 100\u2009bp-width and 600\u2009bp-gap. The regions with significant SICER scores obtained were referred to as \u201cislands\u201d. The scores for each mutant and control (  w  ) were subtracted of their respective input signals. False discovery setting is <5%, and islands with scores less than 200 are excluded from further analyses. The input-subtracted scores for each mutant were compared with those of the control (  w  ) by using the bedtools suite   intersect  , with settings of 50% cross and 200 cut-off. Three categories of ChIP islands were obtained: the mutant-loss islands, mutant-obtained islands, and the mutant/wildtype-shared islands; in which the ChIP signals are decreased, increased, and of no change, respectively. These islands were combined to produce the bedgraph format files, which were loaded onto genome browser for manual analysis of ChIP signals for their chromosome location, base coverage area, relative levels, and distributions. Comparison of data of 3 samples or more used   bedtools multiIntersectBed   with the same cross criteria and cutoff score. \n\nFor quantification, SICER signals from pericentric heterochromatin and euchromatin of chromosome 2 and 3 were separately calculated for the percentage of islands that are decreased, increased, or of no change in each mutant comparing to the control. The total length covered by each type of islands was also calculated for pericentric heterochromatin. The pericentric heterochromatin regions are distinguished from euchromatin based on chromosome band, which is largely consistent with our ChIP-seq data of HP1. They were manually set as: 2L: 22,090,000\u201323,513,711; 2R: 1\u20134,505,672; 3L: 23,247,000\u201328,110,226; 3R: 1\u20134,165,641. The remaining regions on the two chromosomes were treated as euchromatin in calculations. The quantification of HP1 data is based on average of SICER scores from 3 independent ChIP experiments for   Top3\u03b2  , 2 for   AGO2  , and 2 for   Top3\u03b2/AGO2   mutants. The quantification of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 data is based on SICER analysis from 3 independent ChIP experiments. \n\nThe overlapping of ChIP islands between HP1, Top3\u03b2, and AGO2 was calculated based on the width of ChIP SICER peaks. To summarize, both heterochromatin and euchromatin SICER-predicted islands were selected depending on the subject. The overlaps between two ChIP SICER scores were obtained by crossing the two ChIP SICER islands using   bedtools intersect   with at least 50% overlap of the shortest island. The uncrossed portions were obtained by subtracting the crossed SICER island\u2019s width from the total islands of either heterochromatin or euchromatin. The percentage of the SICER islands of a special protein in total heterochromatin was calculated by using the width of SICER islands divided by the length of total heterochromatin of chromosome 2 and 3 (14,956,269 bases). \n\n\n### RNA-sequencing and microarray analysis \n  \nA total of 200\u2009\u03bcl   Drosophila   heads/per sample were collected by fast freezing and sieving. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Three sets of independently prepared RNA samples were applied for RNA sequencing and microarray assay. For the microarray, RNA concentration and quality were measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was labeled using the Agilent Low-Input QuickAmp Labeling Kit, and was purified and quantified according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. A total of 600\u2009ng Cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized for 17\u2009h to Agilent Unrestricted AMADID Release GE 4x44K 60mer   Drosophila   V2 oligo microarrays (G2519F). Following post-hybridization rinses, arrays were scanned using an Agilent SureScan microarray scanner at 3\u2009micron resolution, and hybridization intensity data was extracted from the scanned images using Agilent\u2019s Feature Extraction Software. \n\nMicroarray data was analyzed using\u00a0parametric statistical analysis approach\u00a0and the JMP11 platform-based DIAINE 6.0 analysis suit. After normalization of the gene expression intensities\u00a0by   z  -transformation and generation of\u00a0  z  -scores, samples were first examined by sample scatter plots, sample hierarchical clusters, and principal component analysis. Possible outlier samples were excluded using pairwise analysis. Then, pairwise analysis between different gene groups were performed by pairwise   z  -test with multi-comparison correction to\u00a0generate   z  -test   p  -value,   z  -ratio, fold-change, false discovery rate\u00a0(FDR), and average gene expression levels for each comparison group. All\u00a0microarray results were filtered globally by\u00a0selecting probes with probe\u00a0detection   p  -values\u2009\u2264\u20090.02, and\u00a0sample group one-way independent ANOVA   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.05. The results from probes not meeting the\u00a0above criteria were excluded.\u00a0The filtered probes were then\u00a0further selected to create a list of\u00a0significant probes that must pass all four criteria for each comparison: (a)   z  -test   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.05, (b) FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.30, (c)   z  -ratio or fold change absolute values >=1.5, (d) average signal intensity for each comparison group \u22650. Only results from the list of significant probes were considered significant and used to produce the significant gene lists. When a gene has multiple significant probes, the maxium of the\u00a0average signals of all probes was\u00a0used as the levels of gene expression in subsequent calculations. The difference between levels of gene expression was then calculated, and the data obtained were utilized for gene set enrichment analysis with the   Drosophila   gene oncology database to find the significant functional/pathway level changes and gene\u2013gene interactions. \n\nRNA-seq analysis was proceeded by genome mapping on dm6 version   Drosophila   standard genome by Tophat 2.0.9 with gene coordinators as template and standard parameters. The mapping result bam format files were aligned using Tuxedo tool suite and generated common alignment transcript files and each sample\u2019s FPKM data for further study. The change of gene expression was calculated by Cuffdiff from Tuxedo tool suite and then summarized by mapping gene position. Largest transcript changes for each gene was selected with a   p  -value and   q  -value. The gene list was first filtered by ANOVA test on   z  -scores with   p  -value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. Then the significant genes were selected on the filtered gene by (a)   q  -value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05, (b) fold change value\u2009\u2265\u20091.5. The sample correlation studies were performed by using FPKM of each gene as the raw gene signal and performed the log   z  -transform to obtain gene expression   z  -score as the normalized gene expression level for each gene on each sample. The Pearson correlation coefficients were analyzed and combined with the agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach with average distance method which was used to find possible sample group outliers. This group aggregation effect was further examined by principal component analysis to unveil the group separation patterns. The gene expression data were further used as the input to calculate gene set enrichment analysis by PAGE algorithm ( ) to monitor relative functional change with various comparison pairs. \n\n\n### Immunostaining \n  \nThe wandering third instar larvae were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS and dissected for the salivary glands. The glands were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.6) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. After washing four times, the samples were incubated in 0.1% Triton X100 and 1% normal goat serum in 1\u00d7 PBS for 30\u2009min at room temperature for permeabilization. The primary antibodies (\u03b1-mouse HP1\u2014DSHB C1A9 1:250; \u03b1-mouse H3K9me2\u2014abcam ab1220 1:200; \u03b1-rabbit H3\u2014abcam ab1791 1:200) and secondary antibodies (1:400) were incubated in 0.1% Triton X100 and 1% NGS overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Washing was performed three times in 10\u2009min intervals after each incubation with 0.1% Triton X100 and 1% NGS. Preparations were examined with Zeiss LSM-710 confocal laser scanning microscopy. For quantification of HP1 and H3K9me2, respective channels were separated and the intensity per area was measured using ImageJ. \n\n\n### PEV, eye pigment, LacZ, and bristle quantification \n  \nPEV assays using different   white   reporters have been described . All crosses were performed at 25\u2009\u00b0C except for   w   at 22\u2009\u00b0C. The phenotypes were examined 48\u2009h after eclosion. For eye color quantification, 10 fly heads were homogenized in 0.1% HCl in methanol. After incubating overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, the absorbance of the cleared supernatant was measured at 480\u2009nm. The data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. \n\nThe PEV assay with a LacZ reporter was performed using a published protocol . To summarize, crawling 3rd instar larvae were heat-shocked at 37\u2009\u00b0C water bath for 30\u2009min followed by recovering at room temperature for 30\u2009min. The larvae were dissected in PBS and salivary glands were fixed at 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 20\u2009min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the samples were incubated with 1\u2009mg/ml X-gal for 30\u201360\u2009min. Stained samples were mounted and imaged with Leica M165FC microscope. The assay was repeated three times and at least 10 larvae per sample were analyzed each time. \n\nThe PEV assay based on the   Sb   reporter was performed using a published protocol .   w   and   Top3\u03b2   females were crossed to male   T(2;3)Sb   , In(3R)Mo, Sb   sr   /TM3, Ser   , cn   to assay   Sb   variegation modification. The male progenies were analyzed by counting 7 pairs of major dorsal macrochaetes. The assay was done three times counting at least 20 flies for each trial. \n\nThe RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional silencing assay was performed using a published protocol . The reporter line (GMR-wIR), which expresses an inverted repeat targeting   white  , was crossed with   Top3\u03b2   or   Dcr-2   mutant, and the eye phenotype was examined for more than 20 flies in each genotype. \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6251927, "text_md5": "471ef638ec71fd263e4744afcfbfffa5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 294], "journal": [295, 305], "publication_year": [307, 311], "title": [322, 449], "keywords": [463, 463], "abstract": [476, 1908], "body": [1917, 66350]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30470739, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-07101-4", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251927", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6251927"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251927\">6251927</a>", "list_title": "PMC6251927  Topoisomerase 3\u03b2 interacts with RNAi machinery to promote heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing in Drosophila"}

To meet the demands of international markets, banana plantations require high amounts of chemical fertilizers which translate into high farming costs and are hazardous to the environment when used excessively. Beneficial free-living soil bacteria that colonize the rhizosphere are known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). PGPR affect plant growth in direct or indirect ways and hold great promise for sustainable agriculture. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nPGPR of the genera   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   in banana cv. Williams were evaluated. These plants were produced through in vitro culture and inoculated individually with two rhizobacteria,   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   strain Ps006. Control plants without microbial inoculum were also evaluated. These plants were kept in a controlled climate growth room with conditions required to favor plant-microorganism interactions. These interactions were evaluated at 1-, 48- and 96-h using transcriptome sequencing after inoculation to establish differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in plants elicited by the interaction with the two rhizobacteria. Additionally, droplet digital PCR was performed at 1, 48, 96\u2009h, and also at 15 and 30\u2009days to validate the expression patterns of selected DEGs. The banana cv. Williams transcriptome reported differential expression in a large number of genes of which 22 were experimentally validated. Genes validated experimentally correspond to growth promotion and regulation of specific functions (flowering, photosynthesis, glucose catabolism and root growth) as well as plant defense genes. This study focused on the analysis of 18 genes involved in growth promotion, defense and response to biotic or abiotic stress. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nDifferences in banana gene expression profiles in response to the rhizobacteria evaluated here (  Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   Ps006) are influenced by separate bacterial colonization processes and levels that stimulate distinct groups of genes at various points in time. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-019-5763-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nBanana (  Musa acuminata   Colla) belongs to the Monocotyledons class, Zingiberales order and to the Musaceae family, which is composed of the   Musa   and   Ensete   genera. The   Musa   genus consists of four sections or species groups:   Australimusa, Callimusa, Rhodochlamys   and   Eumusa   [ ], although another section   Ingentimusa   has also been considered as part of   Musa   [ ]. The species of the   Eumusa   section have the largest geographical dispersion, particularly   Musa acuminata   and   Musa balbisiana   [ ]. Bananas are perennial crops that grow quickly and can be harvested throughout the year, being moreover, the largest monoculture worldwide. Commercial cultivation of banana requires large amounts of nitrogen and potassium followed by phosphorus, calcium and magnesium to maintain high yields [ ,  ]. In 2014, bananas were planted around the world in an area covering approximately 5,393,811\u2009ha. The average global production in 2014 was 114,130,151 tons per year, and yield was reported in 211,595\u2009kg/ha. The largest banana-producing countries are India, Uganda, China, the Philippines and some Latin American countries. Ecuador is the largest producer in Latin America (5.1 million tons), followed by Brazil and Colombia [ ]. \n\nDespite the widespread cultivation of bananas, little is known about the microbial rhizosphere of   Musa   spp. Recent studies have shown that microbial populations in banana can be influenced by the type of production system, e.g. agroforestry. Agroforestry increases the number of beneficial bacteria such as   Pseudomonas   spp. and   Stenotrophomonas   spp., and decreases infections caused by pathogens such as   Erwinia   spp. [ ]. Organic fertilization based on   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   NJN-6 has resulted in significant decreases in the incidence of   Fusarium oxysporum  , f.sp. cubense [ ].   Pseudomonas fluorescens   has been isolated from banana plantations infected with   Cylindrocladium   sp. and its suppression by   Pseudomonas fluorescens   has been demonstrated [ ]. Additionally, various microorganisms including   Arthrobacter  ,   Azospirillum  ,   Bradyrhizobium  ,   Bacillus  ,   Pseudomonas  ,   Azotobacter   and   Paenibacillus,   among others, are known plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) [ ,  ]. PGPRs include a wide range of bacteria that may colonize roots with the ability to enhance plant growth by increasing seed germination, plant weight and crop yield [ ]. It has been shown that some PGPRs, when colonizing plant roots, can transform certain compounds exuded by roots into plant growth-promoting substances that manipulate plant hormone signaling pathways [ ,  \u2013 ]. Seed treatment with PGPRs leads to increased plant growth [ \u2013 ] and fruit production [ ,  ].   Bacillus   spp. and   Pseudomonas   spp. have been reported in the banana rhizosphere [ ], and the presence of these PGPRs, has been associated with plant production of exudates that favors the colonization and formation of biofilms in banana roots [ ]. Recently, and previous to this study, the genomes of two PGPRs,   Pseudomonas fluorescens   strain Ps006 and   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 associated with banana cv. Williams seedlings have been isolated and characterized [ ,  ]. According to the aforementioned, the aim of this study is to explore the effect of these two rhizobacteria,   Pseudomonas fluorescens   Ps006 and   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006, on the banana cv. Williams seedling transcriptome and contribute to the current understanding of the banana plant-microorganism interactions in relation to growth promotion. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Effect of PGPR on banana growth \n  \nThe inoculation effect of   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   strain Ps006 on banana plant growth was investigated 55\u2009days post-inoculation at the greenhouse level. Eight variables were evaluated: height (cm), leaf area (cm ), pseudostem thickness (mm), total fresh weight (g/plant), fresh root weight (g/plant), fresh shoot weight (g/plant), total dry weight (g/plant), root dry weight (g/plant) and shoot dry weight (g/plant) (Fig.  ). All variables were significantly higher in samples inoculated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   or   P. fluorescens   compared to the control (no PGPR inoculation). These results agree with the beneficial effects of PGPR on plant development, quantity, quality and yield [ ].   \nBiological assays. Effect of   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) on banana growth compared to the control (no PGPR inoculation). Nine variables were evaluated in 55-days-old seedlings after inoculation: height (cm), leaf area (cm ), pseudostem thickness (mm), total fresh weight, including shoot and root (g/plant), root fresh weight (g/plant), shoot fresh weight (g/plant), total dry weight (g/plant), and shoot dry weight (g/plant). Samples inoculated with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  ,   Pseudomonas fluorescens  , and the control (no PGPR inoculation) are depicted as light-grey, dark-grey and white, respectively. Asterisk (*) denotes   p  -value <\u20090.0001 in treated samples compared to the control \n  \n\n\n### Differential gene expression in response to PGPR \n  \nTo better understand the direct and indirect interactions between banana roots and rhizobacteria, global transcriptome profiles were obtained at 1, 48 and 96\u2009h post-inoculation with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 or   P. fluorescens   Ps006  .   Treated samples (3 biological replicates) were compared against the control (no PGPR inoculation) at 0\u2009h post-inoculation, and genes were considered differentially expressed when the false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 0.05. The banana transcriptome response to   P. fluorescens   showed an increasing number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) over time with 1027, 1398 and 3541 genes being changed at 1, 48, and 96\u2009h, respectively. In contrast, the banana transcriptome response to   B. amyloliquefaciens   showed a decreasing number of DEGs over time with 2652, 1530 and 1250 genes being differentially expressed at 1, 48, and 96\u2009h, respectively. (Additional files  ,  ,  ,  : Figure S1,Table S2, S3, S4). These gene expression differences observed between the   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   treatments could also be influenced by the bacterial colonization level. To better understand this inverse temporal pattern between   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   on induced transcriptional responses, we identified genes differentially expressed in both treatments. The numbers of DEGs shared between treatments were 473, 663 and 598 at 1, 48 and 96\u2009h post-inoculation, respectively (Fig.  ).   \nVenn diagram of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 1, 48 and 96\u2009h post-inoculation with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) (  a  ) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) (  b  ). Venn diagram of DEGs shared between   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   at 1\u2009h (  c  ), 48\u2009h (  d  ) and 96\u2009h (  e  ) post-inoculation \n  \n\n\n### Gene ontology enrichment analysis of DEGs \n  \nA gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed across six treatments and these were compared with the reference control after the first hour to have a better understanding of the functional classes of DEGs for each treatment. Figure   shows the hierarchical clustering and significance of GO Plant Slim-terms over time for both PGPRs.   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   treatments at 1\u2009h share similarities, meanwhile   Bacillus   at 48 and 96\u2009h are also similar, suggesting differences in timing possibly due to levels of bacterial colonization or the induction of distinct metabolic pathways at different times triggered by the PGPR.   \nHierarchical clustering and heat map of the gene ontology enrichment analysis results at 1, 48 and 96\u2009h post-inoculation with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) \n  \n\nGene ontology enriched terms can be grouped into four distinct classes: transcription factors (sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity); genes involved in response to stimuli (stress, external, biotic, abiotic, endogenous); genes involved in cell proliferation (structural molecule activity, ribosome, translation); and genes involved in energy production (generation of precursor metabolites and energy, lipid metabolic process, plastid, thylakoid, photosynthesis) (Table  ). On the other hand, genes involved in cell proliferation are enriched only in   Pseudomonas   at 96\u2009h, and genes involved in energy production are enriched only in   Bacillus   at 48\u2009h. Transcription factors and genes involved in response to stimuli are enriched in samples inoculated with both rhizobacteria at multiple points in time: in   Pseudomonas   at 48 and 96\u2009h, and in   Bacillus   at 48 and 96\u2009h (Table  ).   \nGene ontology enrichment analysis.

NumInCat: number of expressed genes across all experiments (background) in each gene ontology category. DEInCat: number of differentially expressed genes for each gene ontology category in each treatment \n  \n\n\n### Transcription factors differentially expressed in response to PGPR \n  \nTranscription factors (TFs) interact with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression levels. Additionally, a transcription factor is involved in developmental processes, response to intracellular signals, response to the environment, cell cycle control, and pathogenesis, among others. Differentially expressed transcription factors were found not to have large overlaps at the points in time evaluated. However, there was some overlap between strains Bs006 and Ps006 at similar points in time, but there were also a number of specific TFs elicited by each PGPR. It is clear that there are specific interactions and levels of response of TFs in the plant that vary with the PGPR   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) or   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006), as well as with the times after inoculation. Interestingly,   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 starts with 171 differentially expressed TFs in the first hour post-inoculation. However, this effect tapers off in time, with only 30% of transcription factors differentially expresses after 96\u2009h. In the case of   Pseudomonas fluorescens   Bs006, the effect is opposite. This treatment starts with 35 differentially expressed transcription factors one hour after inoculation, but these increase significantly to 182 genes at a later time after inoculation. This fact could also be closely related to the level of bacterial colonization over time. Figure   shows a hierarchical clustering and heat map of differentially expressed genes in the gene ontology category sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700).   \nHierarchical clustering and heat map of differentially expressed genes in the gene ontology category sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700).

Only top 200 genes (ranked by fold-change) are shown \n  \n\n\n###  Changes in banana gene expression in response to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006   and Pseudomonas fluorescens   Ps006   evaluated using ddPCR  \n  \nThe PGPRs   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   Ps006 induced significant changes in the gene expression in banana cv. Williams seedlings. In this study experimental validation trials on 22 selected genes involved in plant growth promotion, defense and biotic or abiotic stresses were performed (Table  ). The expression levels of these 22 genes related to PGPR effects were validated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and with this technique, it was confirmed that the genes evaluated are differentially expressed in the presence of the two rhizobacteria as shown also by RNA-seq. The experimentally validated genes were categorized into several types of functions associated with PGPR effects on growth: root growth, foliar growth, flowering, metabolism, defense, stress, photosynthesis and their trends were plotted (Figs.  ,  ). The RNA-Seq data showed that   Bacillus   induce a response earlier than   Pseudomonas   (Fig.  ). However, this difference in the timing of response between   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   was not observed by ddPCR. It is not clear why we were not able to observe a correlation between RNA-Seq and ddPCR   \nGenes and sequences of primers used for validation by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) \n    \nGene expression trends for banana DEGs in response to   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (1\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 96\u2009h).

The first 6 genes are common with plants treated with   Pseudomonas fluorescens  \n    \nGene expression trends for banana DEGs in response to   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (1\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 96\u2009h).

The first 6 genes are common with plants treated with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  \n  \n\nA large and diverse group of banana genes specifically triggered either by   P. fluorescens   Ps006 or by   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 were genes associated with plant growth promotion, stress response and defense. Several of the genes identified in this study were connected to major plant growth stages and include: cytochrome C, U-Box domain-containing protein 21-like, and serine/threonine-protein kinase (embryonic development), leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein 4, (cell differentiation and morphogenesis), CASP-like protein 4d1, transcription factor Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Protein bHLHP, pectinesterase-like (root growth), cytochrome C (nutrient transport), truncated transcription factor CAULIFLOWER and U-Box domain-containing protein 21-like (flowering), abscisic stress-ripening protein 2, as well as (fruit maturation) truncated transcription factor CAULIFLOWER and pectinesterase-like genes. Additionally, other genes were closely associated with plant growth promotion and include: cytochrome P450, caffeic acid 3-O-methyl transferase, horcolin, and cyclic dof factor. \n\n\n### Genes related to plant promotion and growth \n  \nPGPR are involved in various biotic activities of the soil ecosystem to make it dynamic for turnover and sustainable for crop production [ ]. They competitively colonize plant root systems and enhance plant growth through different mechanisms. Plant cytochrome C (CYTC) is preferentially expressed in root and apical meristems [ ] and its knock-out results lethal and in an arrest of embryonic development. In the current in vitro study, with the presence of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   Ps006, seedlings of banana cv. Williams expressed the CYTC gene LOC103988136 that was transcriptionally overregulated 6.8-fold and 24.58-fold, respectively, at 1\u2009h post-inoculation (Fig.  a). Another activated gene found and belonging to the U-Box family was FB. This transcription factor belongs to one of the largest gene families related to cellular protein degradation (ubiquitinization), that regulate important processes such as cell growth, embryogenesis, floral development, and plant growth. In chickpea, more than 285\u2009F-box genes are located in 8 chromosomes, showing a synteny with oat,   Lotus   and   Arabidopsis   genes [ ]. The LOC103987539 gene was regulated 10.32-fold in the presence of   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  a) and also the gene LOC103986775 elicited by   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 reported a fold change value of 2.34 (Fig.  a). In this study we found that the gene LOC103990849 was overexpressed in the plants treated. This gene described as a serine/threonine-protein kinase, normally occurs early during somatic embryogenesis of banana growth. Recently, this gene has been observed as differentially expressed in banana, specifically in somatic embryogenesis routes [ ]. Using a cDNA-AFLP approach, these researchers detected the early expression of kinase serine/threonine-protein kinase in growing cells in   Musa accuminata   ssp.   malaccensis   [ ]. This gene showed a 3.84-fold expression difference in seedlings treated with   B, amyloliquefaciens   BS006 (Fig.  b) in the banana cv. Williams transcriptome. Plant architecture is an essential component in its growth and development. There are several genes that target these structures, such as LRXI (LOC103991351), a leucine-rich repeat extensor gene that normally is expressed in radicular hair cells and that was up-regulated by PGPR in the banana transcriptome. It has also been suggested that LRX1 is an extracellular component of a mechanism that regulates root morphogenesis and elongation by controlling the polarized growth or the formation and assembly of the cell wall. In this study, LOC103991351 showed a 6.01-fold change in banana cv. Williams inoculated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   (Fig.  b). The CASP-like protein gene 4D1 is a member of the Casparian Strip Membrane Domain Protein family and a transmembrane protein involved in plant growth [ ]. CASP-like 4D1, LOC103976748 was transcriptionally regulated in the presence of Bs006, with a fold change value of 6.03 (Fig.  b). CASP-like 4D1, as well as the extensin LRX3, are influenced by the PGPR presence and are both actively involved in the construction of the plant cell wall [ ,  ]. Expression of the gene LOC103985511, corresponding to a transcription basic helix-loop-helix protein was overregulated 2.56-fold in plants treated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  b). This gene is known for its role in the maturation and growth of root hairs and trichomes [ ]. The members of this family interact with inhibitory proteins (GL1, MYB23, WER) or activators (GLABRA 1) of the MYB family and factor WD40, such as the MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex, which regulates the appearance and growth of trichomes and root hairs. In banana, some of these transcription factors (TF), including MADS, bHLH, WRKY, AP2-EREBP, MYB-related and NAC domain TF families are highly expressed in ripe fruits [ ].   \nGenes expressed under   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) treatments. Genes related to growth promotion were expressed in ddPCR analyzes. (  a  ) LOC103988136, LOC103987539, LOC103986775. (  b  ) LOC103990849, LOC103991351, LOC103976748, LOC103985511, LOC103977424.

(  d  ) LOC103971944, LOC103997576, LOC103971548, LOC103972371 \n  \n\nPectinesterase (PE) is a ubiquitous cell wall-associated enzyme thought to be responsible for the demethylation of galacturonyl residues in high-Mr pectin. This enzyme has been reported in many plant tissues and has been implicated in many developmental processes, including cellular adhesion, stem elongation [ ], pollen tube development [ ], abscission [ ], and fruit ripening [ ]. A differentially expressed pectinestarase gene LOC103977424 found in this transcriptome analysis, was overregulated in about 3.40-fold in seedlings treated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  b). Up-regulation of the truncated transcription factor CAULIFLOWER (CAL) gene LOC103978845 was found in the presence of   P. fluorescens   Ps006. CAULIFLOWER is a member of the factors that regulate flowering. In addition,   P. fluorescens   Ps006 regulated LOC103978845 by 12.93-fold (Fig.  c). CAL in cauliflower is known as AP1, and its counterpart in   Arabidopsis thaliana   are two duplicate genes in plants of the   Brassicaceae   family. CAL and AP1 are factors of the MADS-box family that are involved in plant development, mainly in sepal and petal differentiation. CAL is expressed early in seed maturation and has an active expression at the time of floral meristem development [ ]. In this study, the abscisic stress-ripening protein 2 (ASR) gene, LOC103989093, was expressed with an 8.96-fold change in banana cv. Williams seedlings treated with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  c). ASR plays a role in plants in the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, structural proteins, as well as in other functions. A study on   Musa acuminata   and   M. balbisiana   gene expression and protein analyses revealed that ASR gene expression would be detected in meristem cultures, roots, pseudostems and leaves [ ]. Another gene found overregulated when plants were treated with   P. fluorescens   Ps006 and   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (a 7.63-fold and a 52.96-fold increase, respectively) was LOC103998260, a cyt P450 714B3 gene (Fig.  c). This gene catalyzes extremely diverse reactions leading to the precursors of structural macromolecules such as lignin, cutin, suberin and sporopollenin. P450 has been reported as an important protein in the ripening stages of the   Cavendish   banana, where a protein accumulation occurs in the skin and pulp of mature fruits, but not in the roots, ovaries, flowers and leaves [ ]. LOC103971944, a gene related to a caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) was transcriptionally up-regulated (93.65-fold) in seedlings by effect of a treatment with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  d). The COMT gene in angiosperms is involved in multistage methylation reactions of hydroxylated monomeric lignin precursors [ ]. In plants as alfalfa, strong downregulation of COMT resulted in decreased lignin content, as well as in a reduction in the total guaiacyl (G) lignin units and a nearly total loss of syringyl (S) units in monomeric and dimeric lignin degradation products [ ]. \n\nAn increased transcription of a horcolin gene-like (LOC103997576) with 53.56-fold change was found in banana cv. Williams plants treated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (Fig.  d). The product of this gene is a protein originally found in embryonic tissue of barley (  Hordeum vulgare  ), a lectin with an affinity for mannose. Horcolin, as well as jacalin are actively induced by the presence of gibberellins [ ], which has been reported to be induced in cucumber by the presence of the PGPRs   Burkholderia cepacia   SE4,   Promicomonospora   sp. SE188 and   Acinetobacter calcoaceticos   SE370. Similar to horcolin, the genes LOC103971548 and LOC103972371(Fig.  d), annotated as Cyclic Dof factor 3, were found overexpressed in the current study. These genes were transcriptionally regulated in 1.73-fold and 84.4-fold, respectively, in plants stimulated by   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006. The Cyclic Dof factor 3 has been involved in embryonic development, seed germination, control of flowering [ ,  ], branching of shoots, and development of pollen, fruit and vascular tissues [ \u2013 ]. Furthermore, Dof TFs also participate in carbon metabolism [ ] and other physiological processes such as nitrogen assimilation, phytochrome and cytochrome signaling, as well as plant hormonal signaling. Additionally, this process is regulated by environmental factors such as light, temperature and nutrients, as well as by phytohormones, in particular gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The corresponding gene of this protein has influence in Dof Affecting Germination protein (DAG1), a repressor of light-mediated seed germination processes [ ]. The newly found Dof protein MaDof23 in banana functions as a transcriptional repressor, interacting also with the transcriptional activator MaERF29. Some authors have suggested that these two proteins control banana fruit ripening by working antagonistically to regulate 10 ripening-related genes involved in cell wall degradation and aroma formation [ ]. \n\nThe expression of all these genes described until now would suggest that both PGPR assessed,   P. fluorescens   Ps006 and   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006, trigger plant growth related genes at all levels, probably by increasing nutrient supply in the rhizosphere and/or stimulating the ion transport system in roots. Furthermore, also biological events such as electron transport, redox, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. PGPR influence soil features and their transformation from a sterile and a low quality environment into an arable land, i.e. revitalizing soil quality and potentiating plant growth. \n\n\n### Genes related to stress \n  \nAbiotic and biotic stresses are the most influential limiting factors for agricultural productivity. PGPRs are soil inhabitants that exhibit significant capabilities to mitigate abiotic and biotic stress [ ]. In this study important genes involved in stress response linked to the presence of either   P. fluorescens   Ps006 or   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 were identified. Among these, we find CYTC, CYT P450, AOX2, ACP, and HSPs, as well as the transcription factors MYB, WRKY, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Protein bHLHP and U-Box domain-containing protein 21-like. \n\nCytochrome C, described above as one of the promoting genes that regulated growth in banana cv. Williams, is normally expressed in the roots of plant seedlings when they are subjected to osmotic stress. This gene is induced especially when the plant must meet the energy demand due to increased oxidative respiration and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), or oxygen free radicals [ ,  ]. The CYTC gene is one of the three genes known to be involved in banana plant mitochondrial respiration [ ], and its function is essential in the early stages of plant development, probably because of its role in cyanide-sensitive respiration [ ]. It is possible that these changes do not necessarily indicate a direct effect of the bacteria on the expression of CYTC, since the in vitro system in which the banana cv. Williams seedlings were grown exposed them to respiratory stress in the controlled atmospheric conditions used. P450 is known as other protein actively involved in attempting to detoxify oxygen free radicals actively released under the in vitro stress conditions, similar to those in which the banana cv. Williams seedlings were grown in the current study [ ,  ]. \n\nUnder stress conditions, as well as in senescence and hormonal response, plants trigger the expression of genes like the U-Box transcription factor. Another gene found differentially expressed in the current study was the Ubiquinol oxidase 2, mitochondrial-like gene (AOX2). The AOX2 gene corresponds to an alternative oxidase (Alternative Oxidase AO3). In our study, the gene LOC103983858 (AOX2) was influenced by the presence of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   Ps006, with 0.57-fold and 10.19-fold, respectively (Fig.  a). AOX2, just like its AOX3 isoform, is a mitochondrial intermembrane protein that functions in the alternative respiration pathway that confers cyanide resistance and is an important redox balance sensor, allowing the plant to have activity under conditions of biotic and abiotic stress [ ,  ]. However, AOX2 and AOX3 are not only stress response proteins, since they also have links to several metabolic processes that include carotenoid biosynthesis, chlorine respiration, electron transport in photosystem I (PSI), and works as a regulator in the photosystem II (PSII) [ ]. As was described above, the ASR gene (LOC103989093) was expressed in seedlings treated with   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   Bs006. In banana meristem cultures mAsr1 and mAsr3 genes have been found to be induced by osmotic stress and wounding, meanwhile mAsr3 and mAsr4 were expressed after plant exposure to ABA in banana.   \nGenes expressed under   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) treatments. Genes related to stress were expressed in ddPCR analyzes. (  a  ) LOC103983858. (  b  ) LOC103994690, LOC103998902. (  c  ) LOC103975709, LOC103975393, LOC103998403 \n  \n\nFurther, another gene regulated under stress conditions is the L-ascorbate oxidase homolog (AO). Mutations in this gene reduce the ability of the plant to respond to oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species) and to harmful levels of ozone [ ,  ]. The AO enzyme is normally associated with glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activities. The associated AO-Glutathione, known as the heart of the redox hub, represents one of the major contributions to peroxide detoxification of hydrogen in the chloroplast [ ,  ]. In the current study, the expression of the AO gene LOC103994690 resulted in a 4.09-fold change when banana seedlings were treated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006, meanwhile in the presence of   P. fluorescens   Ps006 it increased to 7.19-fold change (Fig.  b). Additionally, another AO gene, LOC103998902, was also overexpressed in the presence of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 with 1.52-fold change value (Fig.  b). \n\nAdditionally, the Heat shock cognate protein (HSPs) activity helps the correct formation of structures under thermal shock and protects against cellular function damage and during osmotic stress [ ]. The production of HSPs), cold shock proteins and osmoregulation in bacteria regulates survival under adverse conditions. Furthermore, a small 70 KDa HSP was differentially expressed in the banana cv. Williams seedlings in the presence of   P. fluorescens   Ps006. The LOC103975393 gene showed a 12.5-fold change when overregulated in the presence of   P. fluorescens   Ps006 (Fig.  c), meanwhile the LOC103975709 gene is up-regulated by 46.57-fold (Fig.  ). In the case of plants responding to   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006, the gene LOC103998403 was up-regulated 1.57-fold (Fig.  c). \n\n\n### Genes related to defense \n  \nPlants establish beneficial, harmful, or neutral relationships with bacteria. PGPRs may act as molecular cues influencing plant defense [ ]. One of the characteristics of the defense response of plants is the production of genes related to a wound-induced protein 1-like: The wound gene LOC103978608 belongs to a family of plant wound-induced protein sequences related to WI12 from   Mesembryanthemum crystallinum  . WI12 preferentially accumulates in the cell wall and may play a role in the reinforcement of cell wall composition after wounding occurs and during plant development [ ]. This gene has been reported to be expressed in banana by both PGPR used in this study, suggesting its potential in an eventual response of the plant to damage caused by wounds or attack by pathogens. Following the treatment with   B. amyloliquefaciens   BS006, a gene 1.32-fold-change occured, whereas with plants treated with   P. fluorescens   PS006, the change increased reaching a 6.35-fold (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nGenes expressed under   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   (Bs006) and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   (Ps006) treatments. Genes related to defense were expressed in ddPCR analyzes. LOC103978608 \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPlants have always been in a symbiotic relationship with soil microbes (bacteria and fungi) during their growth and development. The symbiotic microorganisms of the free-living soil that inhabit the rhizosphere of many plant species have various beneficial effects on the host [ ]. PGPR influence plant growth through direct and indirect mechanisms that contribute to improve the resistance of the plant to different pathogens. \n\nIn the case of genes related to plant promotion and growth (maturation, flowering, elongation, structure, differentiation and development), it is known that several mechanisms such as nutrient absorption or increase of nutrient availability by nitrogen fixation, mineralization of organic compounds, solubilization of mineral nutrients and production of phytohormones participate in plant growth [ ]. Variations in plant response may be related to the interacting microbial strains or even the plant species. Direct mineral absorption enrichment occurs due to increases in individual ion fluxes on the root surface in the presence of PGPR, thus, increasing nutrient availability. These statements are supported by the fact that previous to this study, ca. 14 genes involved in the synthesis of cofactors, 25 genes implicated in potassium metabolism, 52 genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and 78 genes associated to phosphorus metabolism have been reported in the genome of   P. fluorescens   Ps006. In the case of   B. amyloliquefaciens   BS006, 20 genes are involved in the synthesis of cofactors, 51 in vitamins, 20 in pigments, 9 are involved in the metabolism of potassium, 31 in nitrogen metabolism and finally, 31 are involved in phosphorus metabolism [ ,  ]. \n\nThe expression of stress and defense genes in plants would be mediated by the action of PGPR, involving processes that helps plants to actively grow under abiotic or biotic stress conditions [ ]. PGPR induce the production of repressive substances that increase the natural resistance to pathogens and pests [ ]. These microorganisms participate in plant defense by producing hydrolytic enzymes as chitinases, cellulases and proteases, as well as various antibiotics, volatile organic compounds (VOC), exopolysaccharides (EPS) and siderophores that protect plants against pathogens, among others [ ,  ]. \n\nThe strain   P. fluorescens   Ps006 used in the current study in banana, has a genome that contains 193 genes for the response to environmental stress, as well as genes involved in plant health and defense, described as follows: 14 genes for bacteriocins and antibacterials synthesized ribosomally (peptides), 123 genes for resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and 12 genes for invasion and intracellular resistance. On the other hand, the PGPR genome of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 contains genes related to plant stress, health and defense such as: 1 adhesion, 16 bacteriocins and antibacterial peptides synthesized ribosomally, 37 genes for antibiotic resistance and toxic compounds, 17 genes that regulate invasion and intracellular resistance, and 117 genes involved in latency and sporulation. \n\nBased on the aforementioned, all these PGPR genes would have effects in the banana transcriptome outcome, since they are known to generate and elicit a specific response in plants. To better understand the direct and indirect interactions between banana roots and rhizobacteria, this study defined global transcriptome profiles at 0, 48 and 96\u2009h after inoculation with the bacterial strains. The treated banana plants were compared with the control (plants not inoculated) at 0\u2009h after bacterial exposure, and genes were considered differentially expressed when the FDR was <\u20090.05. The response of banana cv. Williams to   P. fluorescens   showed an increasing number of DEGs over time, i.e. 1027, 1398 and 3541 at 0, 48 and 96\u2009h, respectively. Conversely, plants inoculated with   B. amyloliquefaciens   showed a decrease in the number of DEGs over time: 2652, 1530 and 1250 at 0, 48 and 96\u2009h, respectively. These differences suggest that   Pseudomonas   and   Bacillus   colonize differently banana plant roots. Correlating these data with the colonization pattern evaluated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy, the colonization took place preferably in defined regions of the elongation and differentiation zones of plant roots, as well as in lateral roots and the unions between roots. These results are consistent with those of a previous report published by Liu et al., 2016. In this study, the cells of   B. amylolyquefaciens   Bs006 colonize externally and begins with a very copious growth but decreases in the final evaluation times. Bacteria obtain several advantages when living in biofilms, including protection against predation, drying and exposure to antibacterial substances, and better acquisition of nutrients present in the plant environment [ ]. According to authors biofilms provide survival sites for beneficial and opportunistic bacteria, also providing protection and increasing the potential of bacteria to survive and evolve in the plant environment [ ]. Biofilms have been shown to improve (i) the behavior of individual bacteria or several members in the soil microbial community, and (ii) the health and productivity of plants as a result of the whole microbiome-host interaction [ ]. This group suggests that somehow, the interaction and exchange of nutrients in the case of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (external to the root) are depleted and show temporality. Moreover, in our study, bacterial cellulose could not be found within the banana root tissue, which indicates that the   Bacillus   strain used was not a banana root endophyte. In disease control studies, the population of the biological control agent decreased 15\u2009days after inoculation, which was consistent with a previous study published [ ]. Perhaps this reduction in the apparent population of the biological control agent resulted from the competition of indigenous microorganisms in the soil or the loss of plasmids [ ]. \n\nThis study corroborated that the colonization pattern of   P. fluorescens   Ps006 was endophytic, namely, that it was able to colonize inside the roots. This strain showed few signs and colonization in the roots during the first hour and after 48\u2009h; however, and in contrast, after 96\u2009h the bacterium initiated the endophytic colonization of the root. Somehow, this bacterium manages to enter into the plant and uses the entire energy, enzymatic and nutrient battery in a more stable way by being inside the plant. It is known that after penetration, the rhizobacteria/endophytes can move towards the xylem and be transported systemically to stems and leaves [ ]. The surface of the bacterial cell would play a key role in bacterial aggregation, which in turn promotes bacterial dispersion, survival, and the ability to adhere to plant surfaces. Without any apparent damage to the plant, the endophytic colonization caused by bacteria would reflect their ability to adapt selectively to specific ecological niches that favor an intimate microbe-host association [ ,  ]; furthermore, by using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) it was possible to demonstrate in olive root that cells of   Pseudomonas   spp. actively moved within the hair of the root quickly multiplying inside and progressing along the hair. In vines it has been reported that strain   Pseudomonas   PsJN colonized the rhizosphere, penetrated the roots and then migrated through all plant tissues within 94\u2009h of bacterial application [ ]. These reports are similar to the findings of this study, where the bacterial colonization of banana roots by   Pseudomonas   Ps006, became endophytic 96\u2009h after inoculation. The similar colonization patterns of Ps006 observed in the current experiments would indicates that some in vitro microbe-host models could approach real soil conditions to a certain extent. \n\nAdditionally, in the validation of the genes by ddPCR the same DEGs behavior was also evidenced. A very high initial expression of   B. amyloliquefaciens   induced banana genes that was not persist in time because it decreased, compared to the response of   P. fluorescens  , which showed a timid initial response that was potentiated in the intermediate and final evaluation times. The tendency in many banana genes expressed by   P. fluorescens   interaction was maintained with a high value change in expression patterns, and most interestingly, persisted in time. The differences in banana gene expression induced by the two PGPR could be explained by contrasting colonization models showed by the two microorganisms. \n\nWith this study, the first banana cv. Williams transcriptome elicited by the PGPRs   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   Ps006 is presented, contributing to a better understanding of the biological process that participates in these microbe-plant interactions. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nBananas are an economically important fruit in many parts of the world. In the current study, the transcriptome of banana cv. Williams was sequenced in response to   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   strain Ps006. Twenty-two genes were validated experimentally using ddPCR; these genes were categorized into several types of functions associated with promotion and growth, stress and defense. \n\nIn recently published data carried out by our laboratory, colonization studies conducted in banana with   B. amyloliquefaciens   and   P. fluorescens   revealed that both bacteria behave differently when colonizing plant roots [ ].   B. amyloliquefaciens   showed colonization on the surface of the roots through biofilms; whereas   P. fluorescens   showed an alternative colonization pattern extending as an endophyte that grows inside the roots. \n\nAlthough a high colonization rate was found at the early stages of the interaction between   B. amyloliquefaciens   and the plant, it decreased over time. In contrast, the abundance of   P. fluorescens   increased gradually after inoculation. These observations suggest that somehow the interaction and exchange of nutrients in the case of   B. amyloliquefaciens   Bs006 (external to the root) decrease, showing temporality.   P. fluorescens   Ps006 conversely, colonizes endophytically banana roots 96\u2009h after inoculation. This would reflect their ability to adapt selectively to specific ecological niches that favor a more intimate and stable association over time between   P. fluorescens   Ps006 and banana. Banana plants inoculated with   P. fluorescens   showed an increasing number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) over time: 1027, 1398 and 3541 at 0, 48 and 96\u2009h, respectively. On the other hand, the banana response to   B. amyloliquefaciens   showed a decrease in the number of DEGs over time: 2652, 1530 and 1250 at 0, 48 and 96\u2009h, respectively (see Fig.  ). These differences suggest that   Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   trigger a contrasting response that is closely related to their root colonization patterns in banana. The same trend was evidenced in the validation of the genes by ddPCR evaluated 15 and 30\u2009days after inoculation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Plant material \n  \nBanana (  Musa acuminata   Colla) cv. Williams (Cavendish subgroup, genome AAA) was used in this study. Mother plants of the Williams cultivar were obtained from the ex vitro Musa Bank at the research center C.I. Caribia, AGROSAVIA. Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture medium [ ] supplemented with 0.1\u2009g/l of myoinositol, 3\u2009ppm of benzyl amino purine (BAP), 0.5\u2009ppm of indole acetic acid (IAA), 1\u2009ppm of vitamins (thiamine hydrochloride), and 30\u2009g/l of sucrose was used, and adjusted to pH\u20095.7, for the micropropagation of banana seedlings (meristem extraction) in the laboratory. Seedlings were placed in the growth room under controlled conditions, with a temperature of 23\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C during the day and 20\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C during the night, at 16/8-h light/dark photoperiod, and with a relative humidity of 65%\u2009\u00b1\u200910% for four weeks. The Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture medium was also used for the in vitro propagation and rooting of seedlings. \n\n\n### Bacterial strains \n  \n Bacillus amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 [ ] and   Pseudomonas fluorescens   strain Ps006 [ ] were isolated from   Physalis peruviana   roots and from   Furcraea   spp. in the departments of Boyac\u00e1 and Cauca, Colombia, respectively. These two rhizobacteria were evaluated at the greenhouse level in banana cv. Williams plants for growth promotion. The bacterial strains were cultured on Luria Bertani agar medium (LBA; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and stored in LB liquid medium (LB; Sigma) with 15% glycerol at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C. The final inocula were obtained from a single colony inoculated in LB medium cultured in constant shaking at 28\u2009\u00b0C for 48\u2009h, and then adjusted to a concentration of 10  CFUs ml  with sterile distilled water. \n\n\n### Planting and microbial inoculation \n  \nSeedlings of around 3\u2009cm of height with three fully expanded leaves were transplanted into trays of 24 cones containing a substrate mixture with a proportion of 3: 1 (sand: alluvion). Substrate mixture was sterilized with Agrodine\u00ae (fungicidal and bactericidal) using 3\u2009ml\u2009L  of water for each 18\u2009kg of substrate. Seedlings developed in the growth room under controlled conditions with a temperature of 23\u2009\u00b0C/20\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C\u2009day/night, with a 16/8-h light/dark photoperiod, and with a relative humidity of 65%\u2009\u00b1\u200910% for a maximum period of 30\u2009days (to perform the samplings in the five sampling times established). In vitro plants were inoculated once with 5\u2009ml (10  CFUs ml ) of the   B. amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   strain Ps006 inoculants. For experimental controls, 5\u2009ml of sterile distilled-deionized water was added to plant preparations. For the purposes of sequencing the transcriptome in this investigation, three sampling times were chosen for three biological replicates at 1, 48 and 96\u2009h. However, considering the growth time in the greenhouse (up to 30\u2009days), gene expression was experimentally validated at five sampling times: 1, 48, and 96\u2009h, and additionally after 15 and 30\u2009days (Additional file  , Figure S5). \n\n\n### Experimental design and sampling \n  \nFor the transcriptomic experiments, whole seedlings with three biological replicates per treatment were inoculated with two rhizobacteria strains (  B. amyloliquefaciens   strain Bs006 and   P. fluorescens   strain Ps006) at 1, 48, and 96\u2009h, and after 15 and 30\u2009days. Each treatment was removed from the container and macerated in liquid nitrogen for processing. \n\n\n### RNA extraction \n  \nFor each treatment, three biological replicates were used (three banana plants). A total of 45 corresponding samples were macerated in liquid nitrogen and transferred to 2\u2009ml sterile microfuge tubes. Cold (4\u2009\u00b0C) Plant RNA Reagent (600\u2009\u03bcl; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, San Diego, USA) was added to the tubes followed by vortexing for 1\u2009min and were then incubated on an inclined mixer for 5\u2009min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u2009g for 3\u2009min at room temperature following the procedure according to Yockteng et al. [ ]. The supernatant was transferred to a Phase Lock Gel tube (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) or a sterile RNase-free (USA Scientific, Inc., Ocala, Florida, USA) 2\u2009ml microfuge tube. One hundred \u03bcl (100\u2009\u03bcl) of sterile 5\u2009M NaCl and 300\u2009\u03bcl of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) were added to each tube, and were well mixed by inversion; then, these were centrifuged at 12,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The aqueous (upper) phase was transferred to a sterile RNase-free microfuge. Four hundred and fifty microliters (450\u2009\u03bcl) of LiCl 4\u2009M (Fisher Chemical, New Jersey, USA) and 150\u2009\u03bcl of isopropyl alcohol were added, and the tube was inverted, allowing total RNA to precipitate at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. Tubes were then centrifuged at 12,000\u2009g for 25\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants were removed with micropipettes being careful not to disturb the pellets. One milliliter (1\u2009ml) of 75% (v/v) cold ethanol was added to the pellets followed by centrifugation at 12,000\u2009g for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The ethanol was withdrawn with micropipette and the tubes were centrifuged again for 2\u2009min to collect the residual liquid. Tubes were allowed to dry on ice for 15\u2009min and the pellets were re-suspended in 20\u2009\u03bcl of RNase-free water. To verify the quality of the RNA an electrophoresis gel was run and the degree of integrity (RNA integrity number RIN) of 7 or more was measured [ ] using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Waldbronn, Germany). \n\n\n###  Musa acuminata   transcriptome sequencing \n  \nFor the development of genomic libraries, the SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina Multiplexed Sequencing was used (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To establish the quality of the amplified product, the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies) were used. The concentration of the library under a range of 200 to 400\u2009bp peaks was monitored. The library construction was done with 200\u2009bp inserts, 100\u2009bp paired-end sequencing and 40\u2009M reads per sample. Sequencing of the   Musa acuminata   transcript was performed in the Illumina Hi Scan SQ\u2122 (Towne Center Drive, San Diego, California, USA). \n\n\n### Preprocessing and quality control of RNA-seq \n  \nThe Trimmomatic program version 0.32 [ ] was used to remove sequence adapters and low quality bases using a sliding window length 4, cutting when the average Phred quality score fell below 20. The FastQC software version 0.11.2 ( ) was used for quality control, before and after trimming. \n\n\n### Differential gene expression \n  \nThe Banana Reference Sequence (RefSeq) genome and annotation files were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) included in the Genomes FTP repository ( ). Paired-end reads were mapped against the banana genome using the HISAT2 program version 2.0.0-beta [ ] ( ) with the   --no-unal   option and other parameters as default. Reads mapped to each gene feature were counted using the HTSeq software version 0.6.0 [ ] with default parameters. Raw count tables from 27 samples were merged and low-expressed genes (genes with less than 1 read per million of reads in at least 3 samples) were removed prior to statistical analysis. Raw count data were normalized using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method [ ]. Differential expression analyses were carried out using edgeR software version 3.10.5 [ ]. Pairwise comparisons of three biological replicates belonging to each group were made compared to the 1-h control group as reference.   P  -values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [ ] and genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) <\u20090.05 were considered differentially expressed genes (DEGs). \n\n\n### Gene ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment \n  \nBanana protein-coding genes were mapped with the Gene Ontology Plant Slim-terms using the Blast2GO software version 3.0.11 [ ]. Gene Ontology (GO) categories enriched in the lists of DEGs of banana were identified with the goseq software version 1.20.0 [ ] and using the list of expressed genes in all samples as background. P-values provided by goseq were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) <\u20090.05 were considered GO-enriched terms. \n\n\n### Primer design for gene validation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) \n  \nPrimers were designed using Primer-BLAST at NCBI ( ). The design parameters employed are as follows: a) Product size\u2009=\u200970\u2013150\u2009bp; b) Tm\u2009=\u200958 \u2013 62\u2009\u00b0C with a maximum Tm difference of 2\u2009\u00b0C; c) Search of pairs of primers specific to the desired PCR template was enabled. In this case ddPCR, d) Database\u2009=\u2009RefSeq mRNA Organism   Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis   (taxid: 214687). \n\n\n### Gene validation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) \n  \n#### Synthesis of cDNA \n  \nFive hundred nanograms (500\u2009ng) of total RNA was used with reverse transcriptase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction mixture using SuperScript\u2122 reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 50\u2009\u03bcM oligo dT, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reaction was incubated at 55\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, then inactivated at 80\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. To remove the RNA, 1\u2009\u03bcl of   E. coli   RNase H was added and followed by incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. Product was quantified with the NanoDrop\u2122 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, Delaware, USA), obtaining concentrations between 567 and 1222\u2009ng/\u03bcl. Samples were stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C until used. \n\n\n#### Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) \n  \n Musa acuminata   cDNA was quantified using the QX200\u2122 Droplet Digital\u2122 PCR system (Bio-Rad, Pleasanton, California, USA). The reaction mixture for Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR) is as follows: 12\u2009\u03bcl of ddGCR\u2122 EvaGreen Supermix; 1.2\u2009\u03bcl of the forward primer (250\u2009nM); 1.2\u2009\u03bcl of the reverse primer (250\u2009nM); 4.6\u2009\u03bcl of molecular grade water; and 5\u2009\u03bcl of cDNA, for a final volume of 24\u2009\u03bcl. The mixture was placed in an 8-channel DG8\u2122 Droplet Generator Cartridge (Bio-Rad Laboratories. Hercules, California, USA) and 70\u2009\u03bcl of droplet generation oil was added to the QX200\u2122 Droplet Generator. Samples and oil were combined in the microchannels of the cartridge to generate an emulsion of up to 20,000 drops per sample. The oil droplet suspension was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and placed in the thermocycler. Cycle conditions were as follows: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, 40\u2009cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, and 59\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. Then, a stabilization phase was applied at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min followed by an increase to 90\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The drops were then read automatically by the QX200 Droplet Reader using the QuantaSoft\u2122 software (Bio-Rad). \n\n\n\n\n## Additional Files \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6518610, "text_md5": "60786a6bf3cd3910c4df6b5a5e76a864", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 161], "journal": [162, 174], "publication_year": [176, 180], "title": [191, 335], "keywords": [349, 511], "abstract": [524, 2899], "body": [2908, 56400]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31088352, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-019-5763-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518610", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6518610"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518610\">6518610</a>", "list_title": "PMC6518610  Banana (Musa acuminata) transcriptome profiling in response to rhizobacteria: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Bs006 and Pseudomonas fluorescens Ps006"}

AMPK maintains energy homeostasis in the cell by promoting catabolic and inhibiting anabolic pathways. Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation by the liver kinase B1 or by the Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKK2). The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT signaling cascades. Recent work implicates the participation of IQGAP1 in metabolic function, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here, using several approaches including binding analysis with fusion proteins, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, RT-PCR, and knockout mice, we investigated whether IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling.   In\u00a0vitro   analysis reveals that IQGAP1 binds directly to the \u03b11 subunit of AMPK. In addition, we observed a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and CaMKK2, which is mediated by the IQ domain of IQGAP1. Both CaMKK2 and AMPK associate with IQGAP1 in cells. The ability of metformin and increased intracellular free Ca  concentrations to activate AMPK is reduced in cells lacking IQGAP1. Importantly, Ca -stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was rescued by re-expression of IQGAP1 in IQGAP1-null cell lines. Comparison of the fasting response in wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice revealed that transcriptional regulation of the gluconeogenesis genes PCK1 and G6PC and the fatty acid synthesis genes FASN and ACC1 is impaired in IQGAP1-null mice. Our data disclose a previously unidentified functional interaction between IQGAP1 and AMPK and suggest that IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling. \n \n\n# Body\n \nThe AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates signaling pathways to maintain cellular energy demands. AMPK is a heterotrimer comprising three subunits: an \u03b1 kinase subunit (which exists as \u03b11 or \u03b12 isoforms in mammals) and the \u03b2 and \u03b3 regulatory subunits. AMPK is usually active only when phosphorylated at Thr-172 on the \u03b1 subunit ( ). Phosphorylation of Thr-172 is mediated by one of two kinases: namely liver kinase B1 (LKB1) ( ) and Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKK2) ( ,  ,  ). Energy stress that reduces ATP production (  e.g.  , hypoxia or inhibition of glycolysis) or promotes ATP consumption (  e.g.  , skeletal muscle contraction) increases the ratio of ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP. The increased ADP and AMP enhance Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1. Generally, LKB1 mediates AMPK phosphorylation in response to nutrient deprivation or metformin treatment in most cell types ( ). By contrast, CaMKK2 is activated by Ca . When intracellular free Ca  concentrations ([Ca ] ) increase, Ca  binds to and activates the Ca  regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). Ca /CaM then binds to and activates CaMKK2, which catalyzes phosphorylation of AMPK ( ). Once activated, AMPK catalyzes the phosphorylation of its substrates, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co enzyme A reductase (HMGCR), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) ( ,  ), to modulate processes that promote catabolic and inhibit anabolic pathways (reviewed in ( ,  ,  )). These processes include promoting the surface localization of GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporters to promote glucose transport ( ,  ), phosphorylating enzymes such as ACC1 to inhibit fatty acid synthesis, and regulating transcription of genes, such as glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and ACC1, to inhibit gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis ( ,  ,  ). Decreased AMPK activity is observed in human diseases with insulin resistance,   e.g.  , diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome ( ). \n\nIQGAP1 is a scaffold that regulates diverse processes in numerous cells and tissues by interacting with over 100 binding partners, including several protein kinases ( ). IQGAP1 scaffolds components of certain intracellular signaling pathways to facilitate signaling. For example, IQGAP1 modulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by directly binding to B-Raf, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to facilitate ERK phosphorylation ( ,  ,  ). Similarly, in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, IQGAP1 assembles multiple components of the PI3K signaling cascade to facilitate AKT signaling ( ,  ,  ). In addition, Ca  regulates IQGAP1   via   CaM. CaM binds to the IQ domain of IQGAP1, which alters numerous interactions of IQGAP1, such as its binding to B-Raf ( ), epidermal growth factor receptor ( ), CDC42 ( ,  ), E-cadherin ( ), and RAP1 ( ). \n\nIQGAP1 regulates several biological processes, and recent studies have demonstrated roles for IQGAP1 in metabolic pathways. For example, IQGAP1 binds directly to the insulin receptor and associated downstream components to facilitate insulin signaling ( ). Importantly, both insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis are impaired in IQGAP1-null mice. Consistent with our observations in mice, IQGAP1 expression is reduced in adipocytes derived from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( ). In addition, IQGAP1-null mice display defects in the fasting response, with impaired ketogenesis and reduced fatty acid oxidation ( ). Since AMPK is also involved in insulin resistance and metabolic signaling ( ), we sought to determine if IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling. \n\nHere we identified direct interactions between IQGAP1 and both AMPK and CaMKK2. Reduction of IQGAP1 expression resulted in diminished AMPK activation in several cell types.\u00a0In addition, reduced IQGAP1 expression decreased Ca -stimulated AMPK activation. Further, loss of IQGAP1 from mice impaired transcription of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis genes. \n\n## Results \n  \n### IQGAP1 interacts with the \u03b11 subunit of AMPK \n  \nWe previously documented that IQGAP1 binds directly to components of the MAPK ( ,  ,  ) and the PI3K ( ) signaling cascades. To ascertain if IQGAP1 can interact with AMPK, we transfected HEK293 cells with a GFP-tagged construct of the \u03b11 subunit of AMPK. IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting revealed that AMPK\u03b11 bound to endogenous IQGAP1 (  A  ). Nonimmune rabbit serum (NIRS) was used as a negative control. AMPK\u03b11 was not seen in the NIRS samples, verifying that the interaction between IQGAP1 and AMPK\u03b11 is specific.   \n AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2 co-immunoprecipitate with IQGAP1.   A  , HEK-293 cells were transfected with GFP-AMPK\u03b11. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and endogenous IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IQGAP1 antibody (IQ1). Nonimmune rabbit serum (NIRS) was used as control. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. 1% of the lysate used for IP was resolved in parallel (Input).   B  , HEK-293 cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-AMPK\u03b11. 72 h after transfection, cells were lysed and GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with GFP-Trap Agarose. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. 1% of the lysate used for IP was resolved in parallel (Input).   C  , HEK-293 cells were transfected with GFP-CaMKK2. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous IQGAP1 and Western blotting were performed as described for panel (  A  ).   D  , HEK-293 cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-CaMKK2. Immunoprecipitation of GFP proteins and Western blotting were performed as in panel (  B  ). The positions of migration of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. All data are representative of at least three independent experiments. \n  \n\nTo confirm the interaction, the reverse immunoprecipitation was performed. HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-AMPK\u03b11. GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with GFP-trap Agarose, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting revealed that endogenous IQGAP1 bound to GFP-AMPK\u03b11, but not to GFP alone (  B  ). These data demonstrate that IQGAP1 and AMPK \u03b11 interact in cells. \n\n\n### CaMKK2 and IQGAP1 coimmunoprecipitate from cell lysates \n  \nTo determine whether IQGAP1 associates with other proteins that participate in the AMPK signaling pathway, we examined whether it binds CaMKK2, a kinase that phosphorylates and activates AMPK. We immunoprecipitated IQGAP1 from HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with GFP-CaMKK2. Analogous to our observations with AMPK, CaMKK2 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IQGAP1 (  C  ). No CaMKK2 coprecipitated with NIRS. \n\nTo validate the observation, we performed the reverse immunoprecipitation. We transfected HEK293 cells with GFP or GFP-CaMKK2 and isolated GFP-tagged proteins from cell lysates with GFP-trap Agarose. Western blotting showed that endogenous IQGAP1 bound to GFP-CaMKK2, but not to GFP alone (  D  ). Together these data strongly suggest that IQGAP1 associates with both AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2 in cells. \n\n\n### AMPK\u03b11 binds directly to the IQ domain of IQGAP1 \n  \nTo assess if IQGAP1 binds directly to AMPK\u03b11, we performed   in\u00a0vitro   binding assays with pure proteins. Full-length IQGAP1 and selected portions of IQGAP1 (  A  ) were expressed by   in\u00a0vitro   transcription and translation (T T) and labeled with [ S]methionine in a reticulocyte lysate. Recombinant GST-tagged AMPK\u03b11 was generated, expressed in   Escherichia coli   and purified (  B  ). The [ S]methionine-labeled constructs were incubated with GST-AMPK\u03b11, and the fragments that bound were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Analysis by autoradiography showed that full-length IQGAP1 bound to GST-AMPK\u03b11 (  C  , left panel). Examination of the two halves of IQGAP1 revealed that the N-terminal half (amino acids 2\u2013863), but not the C-half of IQGAP1, bound to AMPK\u03b11 (  C  , left panel). We previously observed that several proteins interact with the IQ domain of IQGAP1 ( ). Therefore, we examined whether this region is sufficient to bind AMPK\u03b11. Pull-down with GST-AMPK\u03b11 demonstrated a clear interaction with the IQ peptide (amino acids 717\u2013916) (  C  , left panel). None of the IQGAP1 constructs bound to GST alone (  C  , right panel), validating the specificity of binding to AMPK\u03b11.   \n AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2 bind directly to IQGAP1   via   its IQ domain.   A  , schematic representation of IQGAP1 constructs. The identified protein interaction motifs (  CHD  , calponin homology domain;   WW  , two tryptophan-containing domain;   IQ  , IQ domain;   GRD  , GAP-related domain;   RGCT  , RasGAP C_terminus) and amino acid residues of each construct are indicated. These constructs correspond to full-length IQGAP1 (F, amino acids 2\u20131657), the N-half (N, 2\u2013863), the IQ domain (IQ, 717\u2013916), and the C-half (C, 864\u20131657) of IQGAP1. IQGAP1\u0394746-860 has amino acids 746 to 860 deleted.   B  , a Coomassie-stained gel of the GST proteins (GST-AMPK\u03b11, GST-CaMKK2, or GST alone) used for binding assays. Data are representative of two independent experiments.   C  , fragments of IQGAP1 (F, N, IQ or C) were expressed and labeled with [ S]methionine using the T T system. The IQGAP1 (IQ1) fragments were incubated with purified recombinant GST-AMPK\u03b11, GST-CaMKK2, or GST alone. Complexes were pulled down (PD) with glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 1% of the T T products were analyzed in parallel (Input, right panel). The positions of migration of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. Data are representative of at least two independent experiments.   D  , T T products of full-length IQGAP1(F) or IQGAP1\u0394746-860 (\u0394746-860) were labeled with biotinylated-lysine and were incubated with purified GST alone, GST-AMPK\u03b11, or GST-CaMKK2. Complexes were pulled down and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut at \u223c120 kDa. The upper portion of the gel (containing IQGAP1) was processed by Western blotting using IRDye-conjugated streptavidin (Strept.). The lower portion of the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. 1% of the T T products were analyzed in parallel (Input). Data are representative of five independent experiments. \n  \n\n\n### CaMKK2 binds directly to the IQ domain of IQGAP1 \n  \nSimilar binding analysis was performed with GST-CaMKK2. Equal amounts of each of the IQGAP1 fragments (  C  , input) were incubated with the GST-CaMKK2 construct. Analogous to the observations with AMPK\u03b11, full-length IQGAP1 bound CaMKK2   via   its N-terminal half; the C-terminal fragment did not bind (  C  , left panel). Moreover, the IQ region was the smallest fragment of IQGAP1 that bound. Taken together, these results reveal that AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2 bind directly to IQGAP1   via   its IQ domain. \n\nIf the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is required for its interaction with AMPK\u03b11 or CaMKK2, deletion of this region should abrogate binding. To test this hypothesis, we used an IQGAP1 construct, termed IQGAP1\u0394746-860, which lacks the IQ domain (  A  ) ( ). IQGAP1\u0394746-860 and full-length IQGAP1, expressed and labeled with biotinylated-lysine by T T, were incubated with purified GST-tagged AMPK\u03b11. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with labeled streptavidin, which has a high affinity for biotin. As was observed with the [ S]methionine-labeled construct, full-length IQGAP1 bound to GST-AMPK\u03b11 (  D  , left panel). By contrast, no IQGAP1\u0394746-860 was detected in the GST-AMPK\u03b11 pulldown. Analogous experiments were performed to evaluate binding to GST-CaMKK2. The results were essentially the same as we observed with GST-AMPK\u03b11; while biotinylated, full-length IQGAP1 readily formed a complex with CaMKK2, IQGAP1\u0394746-860 was unable to bind (  D  ). No IQGAP1 protein was detected in pulldowns with GST alone. The lower panels in   D   are Coomassie-stained gels, which demonstrate that equal amounts of GST-AMPK\u03b11 or GST-CaMKK2 were incubated with each IQGAP1 protein. Moreover, equal amounts of each of the biotinylated IQGAP1 proteins were incubated with each GST construct (  D  , Input). These results reveal that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for its interaction with either AMPK\u03b11 or CaMKK2. \n\n\n### Loss of IQGAP1 impairs activation of AMPK by Ca \n  \nTo evaluate if IQGAP1 influences activation of AMPK by CaMKK2, we used A23187. The ionophore A23187 increases [Ca ] , thereby activating AMPK   via   CaMKK2. We compared the effect of A23187 on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from IQGAP1-null mice and littermate controls. MEFs were incubated with A23187 or DMSO (vehicle control), and phosphorylation of AMPK was evaluated by Western blotting. A23187 stimulated a 2.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82-fold (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) increase in AMPK phosphorylation in control MEFs ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). While A23187 also enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in IQGAP1-null MEFs, the amount of active AMPK was significantly less than that in control cells. To determine if reexpression of IQGAP1 can rescue Ca -mediated stimulation of AMPK phosphorylation, IQGAP1-null MEFs were transfected with Myc-IQGAP1. A23187 enhanced AMPK phosphorylation by 1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19-fold (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) in cells transfected with empty vector. In cells reconstituted with IQGAP1, the stimulation of AMPK phosphorylation induced by [Ca ]  was significantly greater than that in IQGAP1-null MEFs ( ,   C  \u2013  D  ). Importantly, due to its large size, IQGAP1 is expressed in only 22% of the rescue MEFs (data not shown). These observations suggest that the effect of IQGAP1 is even more robust than indicated in the figures. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IQGAP1 is required for maximal activation of AMPK in MEFs by increased [Ca ] .   \n IQGAP1 influences AMPK activation by Ca   .   A  , wild-type (WT) and IQGAP1-null (\u2212/\u2212) MEF cells were treated with DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) for 15 min. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. Two separate blots (i and ii) were performed from the same lysates to probe for multiple proteins. Blot (i) was probed using anti-pAMPK and antitubulin (loading control) antibodies. Blot (ii) was probed with anti-IQGAP1 (IQ1), anti-AMPK, and antitubulin antibodies. The positions of migration of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left.   B  , the pAMPK and tubulin bands from the same blots were quantified with Image Studio 2.0 and pAMPK was corrected for the amount of tubulin in the corresponding sample. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 8) with vehicle-treated wild-type cells set as 1.   C  , IQGAP1-null MEF cells were transfected with empty vector or Myc-IQGAP1 (Myc-IQ1). 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) for 15 min. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-pAMPK, anti-IQGAP1, and antitubulin antibodies.   D  , the pAMPK/tubulin ratios were calculated as described in panel   B  . Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 8) with vehicle-treated cells transfected with empty vector set as 1. All statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. \u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.01; \u2217\u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.001. \n  \n\n\n### Knockdown of IQGAP1 reduces AMPK activation in human cell lines \n  \nTo determine if IQGAP1 participates in Ca -stimulated AMPK signaling in human cells, we knocked down IQGAP1 using siRNA in HepG2 cells. Analogous to our observations in MEFs, A23187 stimulated a significant (1.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83-fold) increase in AMPK phosphorylation in HepG2 cells transfected with control siRNA ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). The ability of increasing [Ca ]  to activate AMPK was significantly attenuated when IQGAP1 was knocked down in HepG2 cells. Basal AMPK phosphorylation was unchanged by IQGAP1 knockdown ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ).   \n Knockdown of IQGAP1 alters AMPK activation in human cell lines.   A  , HepG2 cells were transfected with control or IQGAP1 (IQ1)-targeted siRNA. 72 h after transfection, DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) was added for 15 min. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. Two separate blots (i and ii) were performed to probe for multiple proteins. Blot (i) was probed with anti-IQGAP1, anti-pAMPK, and antitubulin (loading control) antibodies. Blot (ii) was probed with anti-AMPK and antitubulin antibodies.   B  , the pAMPK and tubulin bands from the same blots were quantified with Image Studio 2.0 and corrected for the amount of tubulin in the corresponding sample. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 12) with vehicle-treated cells transfected with control siRNA set as 1.   C  , HeLa cells were transfected with control or IQGAP1-targeted siRNA. 72 h after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) for 15 min. Samples were processed as described for panel A.   D  , the pAMPK/tubulin ratios were calculated as described in panel B. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 11) with vehicle-treated cells transfected with control siRNA set as 1.   E  ,\u00a0HeLa cells were transfected with control or CaMKK2-targeted siRNA. 72 h after transfection, DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) was added for 15 min. Samples were processed as described for panel A.   F  , pAMPK/tubulin ratios were calculated as described for panel B. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 5) with vehicle-treated cells transfected with control siRNA set as 1.   G  , equal amounts of protein lysate from the HeLa cells transfected as described in panel C were analyzed by Western blotting. Blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 (IQ1), anti-pCaMK1, and antitubulin antibodies.   H  , the pCaMK1 and tubulin bands from the same blots were quantified and corrected for the total amount of tubulin in the sample. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 4) with vehicle-treated cells transfected with control siRNA set as 1. All statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. \u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.01; \u2217\u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.001; ns, not significant. \n  \n\nTo further evaluate the role of IQGAP1 in AMPK activation by CaMKK2, we selected HeLa cells. Because the HeLa cell line lacks LKB1 ( ), AMPK phosphorylation is mediated primarily by CaMKK2. In cells transfected with control siRNA, A23187 stimulated a 3.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83-fold (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) increase in AMPK activation ( ,   C  \u2013  D  ). By contrast, when IQGAP1 is knocked down, the increase in AMPK phosphorylation induced by A23187 is significantly attenuated. As observed with HepG2 cells, reduction of IQGAP1 by siRNA in HeLa cells did not alter basal pAMPK ( ,   C  \u2013  D  ). These data validate that IQGAP1 is required for CaMKK2 to maximally activate AMPK. \n\nIn order to confirm that the effects we observed in HeLa cells are mediated   via   CaMKK2, we repeated the analyses in cells in which CaMKK2 was knocked down by siRNA. Basal AMPK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in HeLa cells transfected with CaMKK2 siRNA ( ,   E  \u2013  F  ). Moreover, A23187 was unable to enhance AMPK activation in cells with CaMKK2 knockdown. These data reveal that A23187 stimulates CaMKK2 to activate AMPK in HeLa cells. \n\n\n### Knockdown of IQGAP1 reduces Ca -stimulated CaMKK2 activity \n  \nWe examined the effect of IQGAP1 knockdown on CaMKK2 actvity by evaluating its ability to phosphorylate CaMK1. CaMK1 phosphorylation on Thr-177 was examined in HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA or IQGAP1-targeted siRNA. In cells transfected with control siRNA, A23187 significantly increased CaMK1 phosphorylation (4G and H). By contrast, when IQGAP1 was knocked down, Ca  was unable to stimulate CaMK1 phosphorylation. These data show that Ca -stimulated CaMKK2 activity is decreased when IQGAP1 protein levels are reduced. \n\n\n### Effect of knockdown and reconstitution of IQGAP1 in HeLa cells on activation of AMPK by Ca \n  \nWe also used a second siRNA to evaluate the effect of IQGAP1 knockdown on AMPK activation by Ca . Endogenous IQGAP1 expression was reduced in HeLa cells using a single IQGAP1 siRNA oligonucleotide. We previously documented that this siRNA reduced IQGAP1 protein expression by \u223c80% ( ). In cells transfected with a scrambled control siRNA sequence, A23187 increased pAMPK by 1.95-fold ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). Consistent with our earlier data with a pooled siRNA ( ,   C  \u2013  D  ), knockdown of IQGAP1 with siIQGAP1-8 resulted in markedly decreased AMPK activation by Ca  ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ).   \n IQGAP1\u0394746-860 fails to rescue AMPK activation by Ca   in cells with reduced endogenous IQGAP1.   A  , to knockdown endogenous IQGAP1, HeLa cells were transfected with IQGAP1-targeted siRNA (siIQGAP1-8). Scrambled siRNA was used as the control. 24 h later the cells were transfected with the following plasmids: empty vector or Myc-tagged constructs of wild-type IQGAP1 (WT) or IQGAP1\u0394746-860 (\u0394746-860). 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO (\u2212) or 10 \u03bcM A23187 (+) for 15 min. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. Two separate blots (i and ii) were performed to probe for multiple proteins. Blot (i) was probed with anti-IQGAP1, anti-pAMPK, and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies. Blot (ii) was probed with anti-Myc, anti-AMPK, and anti-GAPDH antibodies.   B  , the pAMPK and GAPDH bands from the same blots were quantified by densitometry using Image Studio 2.0 and pAMPK was corrected for the amount of GAPDH in the corresponding sample. Data are expressed as means (n\u00a0= 2) with vehicle-treated cells in each condition set as\u00a01. \n  \n\nTo determine if reexpression of IQGAP1 can rescue Ca -mediated AMPK activation in HeLa cells, we transfected the IQGAP1 knockdown cells with siRNA resistant wild-type IQGAP1. The level of IQGAP1 expression in the reconstituted cells was essentially the same as that in control cells (  A  ). A23187 increased AMPK phosphorylation by 1.9-fold in cells reconstituted with wild-type IQGAP1, which was the same magnitude as that observed in control cells (without IQGAP1 knockdown) ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). \n\nIf the interaction between IQGAP1 and AMPK and/or CaMKK2 is required for Ca  to activate AMPK, one would anticipate that an IQGAP1 construct that is unable to bind AMPK and CaMKK2 would not be able to rescue the effect of IQGAP1 knockdown. Therefore, we reconstituted IQGAP1 knockdown HeLa cells with siRNA resistant IQGAP1\u0394746-860. Importantly, A23187 was unable to increase AMPK activation in cells expressing IQGAP1\u0394746-860 ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). Note that the amount of IQGAP1\u0394746-860 protein expressed was the same as that in control cells and in cells reconstituted with wild-type IQGAP1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that reexpression of wild-type IQGAP1 can rescue siRNA-mediated defects in AMPK activation and that an interaction of AMPK\u03b11 and/or CaMKK2 with IQGAP1 is required for maximal Ca -mediated AMPK phosphorylation. \n\n\n### Absence of IQGAP1 abrogates AMPK activation by metformin \n  \nTo determine whether IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling independently of CaMKK2, we used metformin. Metformin activates AMPK   via   LKB1 ( ) by altering mitochondrial respiration and cellular AMP and ADP levels ( ). In MEFs obtained from wild-type mice, metformin induced a significant increase (1.51-\u00a0\u00b1 0.27-fold; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) in AMPK phosphorylation ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). By contrast, metformin was unable to enhance AMPK phosphorylation in IQGAP1-null cells. The absence of IQGAP1 did not significantly alter AMPK phosphorylation in untreated cells ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). These data indicate that IQGAP1 is required for AMPK activation by metformin in mouse fibroblasts. \n\n\n### IQGAP1-null mice displayed altered fasting response \n  \nTo assess the possible role of IQGAP1 in the response to nutrient deprivation   in\u00a0vivo  , we used IQGAP1-null mice ( ). One group of mice was maintained on a normal diet, while the other group was fasted for 16 h with water provided   ad libitum  . RNA was purified from both the liver and epididymal fat and changes in gene expression between wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice under fed or fasted conditions were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. We analyzed hepatic mRNA expression of two gluconeogenic genes, namely PCK1 and G6PC, which are induced by fasting ( ). As expected, both PCK1 and G6PC mRNA levels increased significantly in fasted wild-type mice ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). The expression of PCK1 and G6PC was 5.4- and 4.4-fold, respectively, higher in fasted wild-type mice than in fed mice. Expression of PCK1 and G6PC in fed IQGAP1-null mice was essentially the same as in fed wild-type mice ( ,   A  \u2013  B  ). By contrast, when IQGAP1-null mice were fasted, the magnitude of the increased expression of PCK1 and G6PC was less than that in wild-type mice.   \n IQGAP1 influences AMPK activation by metformin.   A  , wild-type (WT) and IQGAP1-null (\u2212/\u2212) MEF cells were treated without (\u2212) or with (+) 5 mM metformin for 4 h. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of protein lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. Two separate blots (i and ii) were performed from the same lysates to probe for multiple proteins. Blot (i) was probed using anti-pAMPK and antitubulin (loading control) antibodies. Blot (ii) was probed with anti-IQGAP1 (IQ1), anti-AMPK, and antitubulin antibodies. The positions of migration of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left.   B  , the pAMPK and tubulin bands from the same blots were quantified with Image Studio 2.0 and pAMPK was corrected for the amount of tubulin in the corresponding sample. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (  n  \u00a0= 7) with untreated wild-type cells set as 1. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. \u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.01. \n    \n Expression of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis genes in IQGAP1-null mice.   Wild-type (IQ1 ) or IQGAP1-null (IQ1 ) mice were fed or fasted for 16 h. Then, mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide and tissues were extracted. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to measure mRNA expression of PCK1 and G6PC in the liver (  panels A   and   B  ) and FASN and ACC1 in the liver (  panels   C   and   D  ) and epididymal fat pads (  panels E   and   F  ). Expression of genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S RNA. Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (n\u00a0= 2\u20134 mice per group, each assay was performed in triplicate) with fed wild-type mice set as 1. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired   t  -test with Welch\u2019s correction. \u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217  p  \u00a0< 0.01. \n  \n\nThe effect of IQGAP1 on AMPK-regulated fatty acid synthesis was also evaluated. We analyzed mRNA expression of FASN and ACC1, two genes that promote fatty acid synthesis and are regulated by AMPK signaling ( ,  ,  ) ( ,   C  \u2013  F  ). When control mice were fasted, FASN expression decreased significantly in the liver and fat ( ,   C  \u2013  E  ). FASN expression in the liver of fed wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice was similar. However, in fat it was significantly (reduction of 73%) lower in fed IQGAP1-null mice than in fed control mice. Interestingly, fasting significantly decreased FASN only in the liver of IQGAP1-null mice; no alteration was observed in epididymal fat ( ,   C  \u2013  E  ). Analysis of ACC1 in wild-type mice revealed that fasting attenuated mRNA expression in the liver and fat, but the magnitude was <25% and did not reach statistical significance ( ,   D  \u2013  F  ). The response of IQGAP1-null mice to fasting was essentially the same. Interestingly, IQGAP1-null mice had lower ACC1 expression than wild-type mice ( ,   D  \u2013  F  ). This decrease was significant in the liver, being 37% and 55% lower in fed and fasted mice, respectively. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nInitially, IQGAP1 was thought to regulate only the cytoskeleton ( ). Subsequent work revealed that IQGAP1 is a scaffold that participates in multiple signaling cascades, such as the MAPK ( ) and PI3K/Akt ( ) signaling pathways. More recent evidence has shown that IQGAP1 also modulates metabolic processes, including those controlled by insulin ( ), which has a critical role in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism ( ), and the nutrient sensor mTor ( ), which coordinates lipogenesis ( ). By interacting with and assembling selected proteins and molecules, IQGAP1 integrates signaling pathways modulating many cellular functions ( ). In this study, we demonstrate a previously unidentified role for IQGAP1 as a component of AMPK signaling. \n\nHere, we demonstrate that IQGAP1 binds directly to the \u03b11 subunit of AMPK. In addition, we identified direct binding of IQGAP1 to CaMKK2, a kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. Interestingly, we observed that both AMPK \u03b11 and CaMKK2 associate with the IQ domain of IQGAP1. This is reminiscent of our prior finding that both the p85 subunit of PI3K and PIPKI\u03b1, the kinase immediately upstream of it in the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, bind to the IQ region of IQGAP1 ( ). In addition to the direct   in vitro   binding, we found that IQGAP1 associates with both CaMKK2 and AMPK in cells. The latter finding is consistent with an interactome analysis of AMPK \u03b11 and \u03b21 in pancreatic cells ( ). IQGAP1 was one of the 381 proteins identified, but the authors did not investigate potential functional consequences. While IQGAP1 is known to bind directly to CaM ( ), to the best of our knowledge, there is no publication that has demonstrated an interaction between CaMKK2 and IQGAP1. Therefore, we designed experiments to explore the potential functional role of IQGAP1 in CaMKK2-mediated activation of AMPK. \n\nAMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 in the \u03b1 subunit, which is catalyzed by either LKB1 or CaMKK2 ( ,  ,  ,  ). Diverse extracellular stimuli, such as hormones, adipogenic molecules, and other circulatory factors, bind to their respective receptors to trigger a transient rise in [Ca ]  enabling formation of Ca /CaM ( ). The Ca /CaM binds to and activates CaMKK2, which can then phosphorylate and activate AMPK ( ,  ). We used several complementary approaches to examine the potential role of IQGAP1 in the activation of AMPK by CaMKK2. We first evaluated the ability of increasing [Ca ]  to activate AMPK in cells lacking IQGAP1. Analysis revealed that Ca -stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK was significantly lower in IQGAP1-null mouse fibroblasts than in control MEFs. Consistent with the hypothesis that the attenuated response was due to the absence of IQGAP1, we observed that reexpression of IQGAP1 in the cells lacking IQGAP1 restored AMPK activation by A23187 in MEFs lacking IQGAP1. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IQGAP1 in human cells inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPK induced by Ca . Moreover, knockdown of IQGAP1 elicited similar results (  i.e.  , impaired AMPK activation by Ca ) in HeLa cells, which lack LKB1 and are thought to depend on CaMKK2 for AMPK activation ( ,  ). \n\nTo investigate the functional relevance of the association of IQGAP1 with AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2, we generated a mutant IQGAP1 construct, termed IQGAP1\u0394746-860, that is unable to bind the two kinases. We compared activation of AMPK in HeLa cells (with knockdown of endogenous IQGAP1) reconstituted with wild-type IQGAP1 to cells reconstituted with IQGAP1\u0394746-860. While wild-type IQGAP1 completely rescued AMPK phosphorylation, A23187 was unable to stimulate AMPK phosphorylation in cells expressing IQGAP1\u0394746-860. These data indicate that the region of IQGAP1 that interacts with AMPK\u03b11 and CaMKK2 is necessary for Ca  to activate AMPK in cells. \n\nSeveral prior publications have established that IQGAP1 mediates diverse effects of Ca , often   via   CaM. The first evidence for this concept was our observation that, in the presence of CaM, Ca  abrogated the ability of IQGAP1 to regulate CDC42 activity ( ,  ). Subsequently, IQGAP1 was shown to integrate Ca /CaM and B-Raf signaling ( ). In addition, Ca  and cAMP signals are integrated at the leading edges of migrating cells by IQGAP1 in a complex with AKAP220 to control cell migration ( ). Moreover, the ability of increased [Ca ]  to induce the release of insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas in response to glucose is impaired by knockdown of IQGAP1 ( ). The data presented here show for the first time that IQGAP1 is also required for Ca  to maximally activate AMPK in cells. \n\nThe molecular mechanism(s) by which IQGAP1 modulates AMPK activation is (are) not known. It seems reasonable to postulate that, analogous to its role in the MAPK ( ,  ,  ) and PI3K/AKT ( ) pathways, IQGAP1 scaffolds AMPK signaling components. In this model, IQGAP1 promotes the coupling between CaMKK2 and AMPK\u03b11 by bringing the two proteins in immediate proximity, thereby facilitating CaMKK2-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK. AMPK function is known to be influenced by scaffold proteins. For example, kinase suppressor of RAS 2 (KSR2), a MAPK scaffold, interacts with the \u03b11 subunit of AMPK, and loss of KSR2 reduces AMPK activation ( ). Another scaffold protein, Nischarin, binds both the \u03b1 subunit of AMPK and LKB1, thereby modulating AMPK signaling ( ). A second possibility is that IQGAP1 regulates the activity of CaMKK2. Two mechanisms are feasible. IQGAP1 may act as a source of CaM to activate CaMKK2. IQGAP1 binds both Ca /CaM and Ca -free CaM (apoCaM) ( ), while CaMKK2 binds to Ca /CaM) ( ). At resting low [Ca ] , apoCaM is constitutively bound to IQGAP1 ( ). In response to an extracellular stimulus, a transient increase in [Ca ]  in a localized subcellular region converts the apoCaM bound to IQGAP1 to Ca /CaM. The high affinity of Ca /CaM for CaMKK2 induces binding and activation, which leads to AMPK activation. Alternatively, direct binding of IQGAP1 to CaMMK2 may alter the conformation of the enzyme, releasing it from an autoinhibited state and enhancing kinase activity. IQGAP1 is known to augment the activity of other kinases. For example,   in\u00a0vitro   experiments have demonstrated that IQGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of B-Raf ( ) and phosphoinositide kinases ( ). The models proposed above are not mutually exclusive, and more than one may operate in cells. \n\nOur data also reveal that IQGAP1 participates in activation of AMPK independently of CaMKK2. We observed that metformin is unable to increase AMPK phosphorylation in IQGAP1-null cells. Metformin is the primary drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( ) and is used by millions of people worldwide. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how it elicits its effects is important. Although details of the mechanism by which metformin activates AMPK remain controversial ( ), evidence supports a fundamental role for LKB1-catalyzed phosphorylation of AMPK ( ). It is not known whether a direct interaction with IQGAP1 is required for AMPK activation by metformin. While we are not aware of any published data that LKB1 binds IQGAP1, it is conceivable that IQGAP1 could act as a scaffold for LKB1 and AMPK, enabling phosphorylation. Additional work is required to elucidate the role of IQGAP1 in AMPK activation by LKB1. Regardless of the mechanism by which IQGAP1 contributes to activation of AMPK by metformin, our collective data suggest that the absence of IQGAP1 leads to a general defect in AMPK activation. \n\nAMPK signaling is critical for the regulation of many aspects of whole-body metabolism. To investigate the potential effects of IQGAP1 on AMPK signaling, we compared the activation of selected genes in IQGAP1-null mice to their littermate controls. We stimulated the AMPK signaling pathway by fasting mice ( ,  ,  ). The response of G6PC and PCK1 (which regulate gluconeogenesis) to fasting in the liver of mice lacking IQGAP1 was significantly less than that in wild-type mice. Our findings are very similar to the published observations in hepatocytes derived from the livers of CaMKK2 knockout mice ( ). The authors observed that catecholamine-induced gluconeogenesis, assessed by quantifying G6PC and PCK1 mRNA, in hepatocytes was impaired by the absence of CaMKK2. As fasting induces catecholamine release ( ), it is possible that the decreased response of G6PC and PCK1 to fasting in IQGAP1-null mice is mediated by CaMKK2. The expression level of the fatty acid synthesis gene FASN in the epididymal fat of IQGAP1-null mice was 73% lower than that in control mice, and the normal decrease in FASN elicited by fasting was absent from the knockout mice. By contrast, fasting reduces the expression of FASN in the livers of both wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice. This response is most likely due to the high levels in the liver of IQGAP2, which has been shown to influence the expression of FASN in mouse liver ( ). Since G6PC, PCK1, and FASN are regulated by AMPK signaling and we demonstrate here that IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling, we hypothesize that IQGAP1 is involved in fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis at least in part through the AMPK pathway. Notwithstanding our observations, it should be borne in mind that regulation of both gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism   in\u00a0vivo   involves an intricate interplay of multiple signaling pathways, which are influenced by diverse stimuli from different parts of the body. As mentioned, IQGAP1 participates in several signaling cascades, and some of the effects we observed may be mediated through one or more of these pathways. Regardless of the molecular mechanism, our data strongly suggest that IQGAP1 is necessary for the normal expression and response to fasting of genes that regulate gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. \n\nDue to its fundamental role in energy control, AMPK has been the focus of intense research over the last few years. A large body of evidence supports the concept that activation of AMPK is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of a variety of chronic diseases, particularly metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome ( ). We recently documented that IQGAP1 is necessary for optimal activation of insulin signaling, and mice lacking IQGAP1 have impaired glucose tolerance ( ), which is a fundamental component of type 2 diabetes. The data presented in this study that IQGAP1 binds AMPK and is required for maximum activation of AMPK raise the possibility that the interaction between AMPK and IQGAP1 could be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic agents for metabolic disorders. \n\n\n## Experimental procedures \n  \n### Materials \n  \nLipofectamine 2000 Reagent (catalogue number 11668019), Lipofectamine LTX Reagent (catalogue number 15338500), and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (catalogue number 13778150) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Membranes were probed with anti-IQGAP1, anti-pAMPK, anti-AMPK, anti-pCaMK1, antitubulin, and/or anti-CaMKK2 antibodies and visualized as described above. The amounts of pAMPK or pCaMK1 were quantified and corrected for the amounts of tubulin in the same samples. \n\nFor the combined knockdown and rescue experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM siIQGAP1-8 or scrambled siRNA (control) and 10 \u03bcl Lipofectamine RNAi MAX in 200 \u03bcl Optimem per well in a 6-well plate. Cells were trypsinized, and 100,000 cells per well were added to 6-well dishes. After 24 h, HeLa cells were transfected with 2 \u03bcg of siRNA-resistant IQGAP1 plasmids or vector control using 6 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 \u03bcl Optimem according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 72 h after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM A23187 for 15 min. \n\n\n### T T product production and binding analysis \n  \nFull-length IQGAP1, the N-terminal half (amino acids 2\u2013864), the C-terminal half (865\u20131657), and the IQ region (717\u2013916) were synthesized using the T T quick coupled transcription and translation (T T) system (Promega) essentially as described previously ( ). Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of pcDNA3-IQGAP1, IQGAP1-N, IQGAP1-C, or IQGAP1-IQ was incubated with 40 \u03bcl of T T Quick Master Mix (Promega) and 20 \u03bcCi of [ S]methionine (PerkinElmer) at 30 \u00b0C for 90 min.

After washing, complexes were detected using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR). \n\n\n### Immunoprecipitation \n  \nImmunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described ( ). Briefly, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes to obtain 80% confluence. The following day, cells were transfected with GFP-CaMKK2, GFP-AMPK\u03b11, or GFP alone. After 48 to 72 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were subjected to sonication for 5 s, and the insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000  g   at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Supernatants were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Clarified cell lysates were equalized for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent protein assay, and equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. Similar samples were incubated with NIRS as the negative control and were processed in parallel.

The following day, cells were incubated with 5 mM metformin for 4\u00a0h or 10 \u03bcM A23187 for 15 min in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. DMSO was used as a control for A23187. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, sonicated, and resolved by Western blotting as described above. Membranes were probed with anti-IQGAP1, anti-pAMPK, anti-AMPK, antitubulin, and/or anti-CaMKK2 antibodies and visualized as described above. The amounts of pAMPK were quantified and corrected for the amounts of tubulin in the same samples. \n\n\n### Animals \n  \nIQGAP1-null ( ) and wild-type (littermate control) mice were bred in the animal facility at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and maintained according to NIH guidelines. The studies were performed with approval of the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Wild-type or IQGAP1-null male mice (14\u201318 weeks old) were fasted for 16 h with water available   ad libitum  , then mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide. The liver and epididymal fat pads were harvested and frozen immediately. \n\n\n### RNA extraction \n  \n100 mg of tissue was placed in a homogenizing tube containing CKMix beads (catalogue number 10409, Bertin) and 1\u00a0ml of TRIzol Reagent. Tissues were subjected to centrifugation at 6500 rpm for 20 s using a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin). Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000  g   at 4 \u00b0C. 200 \u03bcl of chloroform was added to the supernatant. After incubation for 3 min at 22 \u00b0C, the samples were subjected to centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000  g   at 4 \u00b0C. The aqueous phase containing the RNA was transferred to a new tube, and 500 \u03bcl of chloroform was added. After incubation for 10 min at 22 \u00b0C, samples were subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000  g   at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 75% ethanol and transferred to an RNeasy Mini spin column (catalogue number 74104, QIAGEN). RNA was extracted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n\n### Quantitative RT-PCR \n  \nTotal RNA isolated from mouse tissues was used for quantitative RT-PCR. 1 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase kit (catalogue number 4368814, Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (catalogue number 4309155, Applied Biosystems) and 200 nM forward and reverse primers, essentially as previously described ( ). The primers used are described in  . RT-PCR enzyme activation was initiated for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and then amplified for 40 cycles (15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C). The fold change in mRNA expression was calculated by the delta\u2013delta CT method with StepOnePlus software (Applied Biosystems). Expression of genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S. Each assay was performed in triplicate.   \nPrimers used in this study \n  \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWestern blots were quantified with Image Studio 2.0 (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After quantifying the bands, we calculated the ratio of each pAMPK band to the relevant loading control band (tubulin) in the same sample. We normalized data by dividing each ratio by the ratio of control (untreated, vector-transfected, or endogenous IQGAP1 expressing cells) to its loading control. Thus, control cells equaled 1. Statistical analysis of AMPK signaling was performed by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with a Geisser\u2013Greenhouse correction using Prism7 (GraphPad). All analyses were corrected with the Tukey post-hoc test. Statistical analysis of mRNA expression was performed by unpaired   t  -test with Welch\u2019s correction using Prism7. Wild-type fed mice were set as\u00a01. \n\n\n\n## Data availability \n  \nAll data are contained in the article. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7948462, "text_md5": "d3514225db05af3a1607593f03e90038", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 121], "journal": [122, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 211], "keywords": [225, 1060], "abstract": [1073, 2794], "body": [2803, 54796]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33191271, "doi": "10.1074/jbc.RA120.016193", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7948462", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7948462"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7948462\">7948462</a>", "list_title": "PMC7948462  IQGAP1 binds AMPK and is required for maximum AMPK activation"}

To ensure an optimal inflammatory response, RIPK1 is post-translationally regulated by well characterised ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events, as well as caspase-8 mediated cleavage . The physiological relevance of this cleavage remains unclear, though it is believed to inhibit activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis . Here we show that heterozygous missense mutations p.D324N, p.D324H and p.D324Y prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 in humans and result in early-onset periodic fever episodes and severe intermittent lymphadenopathy, a condition we designate \u2018Cleavage-resistant RIPK1-Induced Autoinflammatory\u2019 (CRIA) syndrome. To define the mechanism for this disease we generated a cleavage-resistant   Ripk1   mutant mouse strain. While   Ripk1   mice die postnatally from systemic inflammation,   Ripk1   mice died during embryogenesis. Embryonic lethality was completely prevented by combined loss of   Casp8   and   Ripk3   but not by loss of   Ripk3   or   Mlkl   alone. Loss of RIPK1 kinase activity also prevented   Ripk1   embryonic lethality, however the mice died before weaning from multi organ inflammation in a RIPK3 dependent manner. Consistently,   Ripk1   and   Ripk1   cells were hypersensitive to RIPK3 dependent TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Heterozygous   Ripk1   mice were viable and grossly normal, but were hyper-responsive to inflammatory stimuli   in vivo.   Our results demonstrate the importance of caspase-mediated RIPK1 cleavage during embryonic development and show that caspase cleavage of RIPK1 not only inhibits necroptosis but maintains inflammatory homeostasis throughout life. \n \n\n# Body\n \nMembers of three families presented with a previously undescribed autoinflammatory disorder characterised by fevers and pronounced lymphadenopathy beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout adulthood ( ). From birth or shortly thereafter, all affected individuals experienced fevers usually occurring approximately every 2-4 weeks, lasting 1-7 days, and reaching temperatures as high as 40-41\u00b0C. Some subjects reported extreme chills, severe headaches, and/or hallucinations coincident with their fevers. These flares were accompanied by intermittent episodes of cervical, axillary, inguinal, and/or periaortic lymphadenopathy that often caused pain or discomfort ( ,  ). Several individuals experienced splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly, which were generally more prominent early in life, as well as oral ulcers, arthralgia, or gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, or weight loss ( ). Patient 7 (P7) exhibited a more chronic inflammation with acute exacerbation. Subjects often had elevated inflammatory markers even during symptom-free periods. In contrast to some more severe autoinflammatory disorders, there were no signs of rash, arthritis, genital ulcers or end-stage organ damage and the condition was not life-threatening in any of the patients ( ). \n\nLymphocyte counts were normal between flares in the seven affected subjects ( ). However, pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated in the serum from P7 when inflamed but not during a flare ( ). Transcriptomic analysis from P7 whole blood RNA revealed an enrichment of several inflammatory gene signatures ( , ). Affected members of family 2 had all taken prednisone during flares, with varying degrees of acute relief but without long term prevention of future episodes ( ). P1, P6 and P7 had tonsillitis ( ), but tonsillectomy did not improve symptoms. Similarly, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, and the TNF antagonist, etanercept, did not suppress inflammation in P1, P2, P4 or P7 ( ). However, treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab markedly, and in some cases dramatically, reduced the severity and frequency of the symptoms of P1, P2, P3, P6 and P7 ( ,  ,  ). Tocilizumab also provided some initial relief to P4, but P4 reported aggravation of pre-existing oral ulcers, while P6 reported eventual onset of hand pain, and both subjects elected to discontinue treatment ( ). \n\nExome sequencing in P1 and her unaffected parents and all eight members of family 2 revealed that   RIPK1   was the only gene in which a variant from both families satisfied filtering criteria. A third mutation in   RIPK1   was later discovered in family 3. Affected individuals from the three families had different heterozygous missense mutations at the same critical aspartate residue required for RIPK1 cleavage by caspase-8 ( ). The mutations p.D324N and p.D324Y occurred   de novo   in families 1 ( ) and 3, respectively, while p.D324H was inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in family 2. These mutations are not reported in variant databases ( ), and none of the families had rare co-segregating coding or splice mutations in genes previously implicated in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) or other monogenic autoinflammatory disorders.   RIPK1   cleavage site mutations were not found in an additional 554 individuals with sporadic unexplained fever, lymphadenopathy, ALPS, or idiopathic Castleman disease that we screened by Sanger or targeted hybrid capture sequencing ( ). We therefore designated this condition as \u2018Cleavage-resistant RIPK1-Induced Autoinflammatory\u2019 (CRIA) syndrome. \n\nThe optimal caspase-8 cleavage motif is highly conserved in vertebrates ( ,  ). RIPK1 can be cleaved by both caspase-6 and -8 yielding products of similar size, though the caspase-6 cleavage site has not been defined . Consistent with these reports, RIPK1 mutants found in the patients, as well as D324A that has previously been shown to prevent RIPK1 cleavage by caspase-8 (ref.  ), were resistant to both caspase-6 and -8 cleavage   in vitro   suggesting the caspase-6/8 cleavage site is the same ( ). \n\nTo investigate the molecular mechanism for CRIA syndrome and characterise the role of RIPK1 cleavage   in vivo  , we generated RIPK1 cleavage-resistant mice. Rather than choose one of the disease-associated variants we mutated the aspartate to alanine. While the heterozygous   Ripk1   mice were viable and grossly normal, the homozygous   Ripk1   mice died mid-embryogenesis; much earlier than the postnatal lethality of the   Ripk1   mice  ( ,  ).   Ripk1   lethality occurred between embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E11.5, with the embryos showing multiple sites of mild to severe hemorrhage beginning in the cephalic vascular plexus, in the the midbrain and hindbrain, but ultimately affecting the entire embryo including the pharyngeal arches and the pericardial space ( ). At E11.5, all   Ripk1   embryos were dead and displayed major hemorrhage in multiple locations ( ,  ). E10.5   Ripk1   embryos had endocardial cushion hypoplasia, smaller limbs buds and a thinner neural retina ( ). These developmental delays might be due to the defective vasculature, associated with extensive cell death observed in the yolk sac of these embryos ( ). This phenotype was reminiscent of several strains of knock-out mice with defects in TNF signalling, including   Casp8   mice . The E10.5 lethality of   Casp8   mice is TNF-dependent , and can be prevented by loss of either   Ripk3   or   Mlkl  , suggesting that the lethality is due to TNF-induced activation of the necroptotic pathway that is normally inhibited by caspase-8. These findings led to the idea that cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis during embryogenesis . However,   Ripk1   Ripk3   mice were not viable, consistent with Zhang   et al.  . Nevertheless loss of RIPK3 extended survival more than MLKL loss indicating that RIPK3 plays a non-necroptotic role in the early embryonic lethality ( ,  ). Combined loss of   Casp8   and   Ripk3   in these mice prevented the embryonic lethality, implying that caspase-8 does more than inhibit RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-induced necroptosis at this embryonic stage ( ,  ). While loss of   Ripk1   ameliorates the ALPS-like disorder observed in   Casp8 Ripk3  mice , lack of RIPK1 cleavage did not dramatically affect it ( ), consistent with observations in   Fadd Ripk3 Ripk1   mice . Interestingly, inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity also rescued the lethality of   Ripk1   ( ). However,   Ripk1   mice were runty and did not survive past weaning ( ). These mice had a multi organ inflammation presenting with skin hyperplasia, infiltration of leukocytes in the liver and the lung, disorganised splenic architecture and scattered cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in these organs ( ). Loss of one allele of   Ripk3   or   Casp8   prolonged survival of   Ripk1   mice to 5-weeks-old and complete loss of   Ripk3   rescued the inflammatory phenotype of   Ripk1   mice ( ). \n\nTo explore the function of RIPK1 cleavage in TNF signalling, we tested homozygous   Ripk1   Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) for their response to TNF-induced cell death. Remarkably, even though TNF is not usually cytotoxic, we found that   Ripk1   MEFs were sensitive to TNF alone and this induced increased phosphorylation of RIPK1, as well as activation of caspase-8 when compared to wild type MEFs ( ). While inhibiting caspases or RIPK3 kinase activity did not affect cell death induced by TNF, genetic loss of RIPK3 or RIPK1 kinase activity significantly reduced TNF-induced cell death ( ). Interestingly, loss of RIPK3 not only completely abrogated death but also blocked RIPK1 phosphorylation and caspase activation ( ). \n\nGiven that the patients harbor   RIPK1   mutations in only one allele, we tested the sensitivity of several   Ripk1   heterozygous cell types to TNF. In contrast to homozygote   Ripk1   MEFs, none of the tested   Ripk1   cell types were sensitive to TNF alone ( ). However, inhibitors that directly activate the cytotoxic activity of RIPK1 (e.g. Smac-mimetic, TAK1, IKK and MK2 inhibitors)  rapidly sensitised   Ripk1   MEFs and Mouse Dermal Fibroblasts (MDFs) to low dose TNF ( ,  ). In contrast, only Smac-mimetic and TAK1 inhibitor sensitised   Ripk1   Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) to low dose TNF ( ). In   Ripk1   MEFs, TNF-induced cell death was more pronounced upon addition of IKK, TAK1 or Smac-mimetic/MK2 inhibitor ( ). In addition, homozygote and heterozygote   Ripk1   MEFs and MDFs were slightly more sensitive to apoptosis induced by low dose TNF and cycloheximide ( ). \n\nTreatment with TNF plus Smac mimetic (TS) induced a strong phosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3, as well as activation of caspase-8 and -3, in   Ripk1   cells ( ) which was more pronounced in the   Ripk1   homozygote cells ( ,  ). This increase in TS-induced cell death correlated with increased formation of a RIPK1/caspase-8 containing complex 2 ( ). \n\nSurprisingly, given the increase in caspase-8 activation, loss of RIPK3 dramatically delayed cell death induced by TNF plus Smac-mimetic or TAK1 or IKK or MK2 inhibitors in both   Ripk1   homozygote and heterozygote fibroblasts ( ,  ). In fibroblasts, loss of RIPK3 correlated with significantly reduced RIPK1 auto-phosphorylation and caspase activation upon TS treatment ( ,  ). However, inhibition of RIPK3 kinase had little effect on the induction of cell death ( ), suggesting that RIPK3 contributes mostly in a structural capacity to the activation of caspase-8 in   Ripk1   cells. \n\nWe next analysed both   Ripk1   homozygote and heterozygote cells and, as expected, genetic loss of RIPK1 kinase activity prevented RIPK1 auto-phosphorylation ( ,  ). It also provided some protection from cell death and this effect was mirrored by treatment with the RIPK1 inhibitor, Necrostatin ( ,  ). Akin to RIPK3 loss, this correlated with reduced caspase-8 activation ( ,  ). Taken together, these results imply that, in fibroblasts RIPK3 promotes caspase-8 activation in a manner that is independent of its kinase activity and mostly independent of RIPK1's kinase activity ( ), unless RIPK1 is further activated by an activating stimulus, such as Smac-mimetic ( ). \n\nOne surprising observation was that the strong activation of caspase-8 in   Ripk1   cells led to RIPK1 cleavage ( ,  ,  ). In the case of the heterozygote cells this was almost certainly due to cleavage of the wild type protein, however, we also detected a slightly smaller RIPK1 cleavage product in homozygote cells ( ,  ,  ). This was the result of an alternative cleavage site (D301 in mouse) that is as well conserved as the canonical site ( ,  ). However, possibly due to the unfavourable hydrophobic amino acid in the P1' position , the D301 site was far less efficiently cleaved than the D325 site and only when the canonical site was mutated ( ,  ,  ). \n\nCRIA syndrome patients suffer from recurrent fevers, so to understand how loss of RIPK1 cleavage might affect the response to inflammatory stimuli, we tested the responsiveness of the   Ripk1   mice to Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) ligands. While there was not a dramatic difference in IL-6 levels, TNF and IL-1\u03b2 levels were higher in the   Ripk1   sera after injection of a non-lethal dose of either LPS or poly(I:C) ( ,  ). Similarly, PBMCs from P7 produced more TNF and IL-1\u03b2 upon LPS or poly(I:C) ( ,  ). Despite these elevated cytokine levels, hypothermia induced by LPS was not life-threatening ( ), which was also consistent with the symptoms of the CRIA syndrome patients. BMDMs also produced more TNF upon TLR activation ( ), which correlated with the amount of cell death induced ( ). \n\nTo define the contribution of the hematopoietic compartment to the hyper-inflammatory phenotype, we generated bone marrow chimeras. Interestingly, both wild type mice transplanted with   Ripk1   hematopoietic cells and   Ripk1   mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow were hyper-responsive to LPS compared with the controls ( ). Although our data suggest that the increased inflammatory response in mice correlates with increased cell death in   Ripk1   cells, RIPK1 also contributes to the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signalling pathways . However, loss of RIPK1 cleavage did not affect TNF-induced NF-\u03baB or MAPK activation in either mouse cells or patient derived dermal-fibroblasts ( ). Furthermore, the cytokine increases observed in the   Ripk1   sera were dependent on RIPK3 and caspase-8, suggesting that cell death is the major contributor to cytokine induction in these mice ( ). \n\nRIPK1 plays a role in activating NF-\u03baB and MAPK inflammatory pathways, caspase-8 mediated apoptosis and RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. Each of these distinct responses can contribute to inflammatory signalling and it has been difficult to disentangle which pathway causes inflammation in any given physiological situation. We describe a human autoinflammatory disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in RIPK1 seemingly constrained to a single, evolutionary conserved, aspartate residue at the caspase-6/8 cleavage site. Mutation of this key aspartate prevents caspase-6/8 cleavage of RIPK1, sensitises cells to TNF-induced cell death, and causes embryonic lethality in homozygous mice. Multiple mechanisms inhibit cell death upon TNF stimulation  and our data emphasize how important this is in limiting an inflammatory response. Pathogens may counter cell death mediated inflammation by expressing caspase-8 inhibitors and a cellular defensive mechanism that amplifies the cell death response in the absence of RIPK1 cleavage makes intuitive sense, and may explain why some pathogens also attempt to cleave RIPK1 . Previously, the presumption was that pathogen inhibition of caspase-8 unleashed the necroptotic pathway, however RIPK1 cleavage not only limits necroptosis, as previously assumed but can also limit caspase-8 mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, RIPK3 and RIPK1's kinase activity have mainly been thought of as activators of necroptosis. However, the rescue of the post-natal lethal phenotype of the   Ripk1   mice by loss of   Casp8   or   Ripk3   reveals a far more complex interplay between these molecules than previously anticipated. Our data provide support for the concept of a hierarchy of preferred responses to TNF signalling: cell survival, then caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, with necroptosis as a last resort ( ). Notably, despite the fact that most of our knowledge of RIPK1 function comes from analyses of TNF signalling, and that TNF plays a pivotal role in many inflammatory diseases, CRIA syndrome patients responded to the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab but failed to respond to TNF inhibitors. It will be interesting therefore to determine what role RIPK1 plays in IL-6 mediated inflammation. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subject enrollment \n  \nFamilies were enrolled and evaluated in the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Human studies complied with relevant ethical regulations and all subjects provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Tocilizumab treatment \n  \nP1 was 11 years old at the time of her first intravenous (IV) infusion of tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg. She initially received medication every 3 weeks but later reduced the frequency to every 4 or 5 weeks because of a busy high school schedule. On the less frequent dosing, P1 had more breakthrough symptoms, mainly tender lymphadenopathy. In 2018, when the FDA approved the use of the injectable form in children with JIA, P1 was switched to 162 mg by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks and did very well on this regimen. P2, P3, P4, and P6 received regular self-administered tocilizumab by 162 mg subcutaneous injections starting at every 2 weeks, the standard dose and route of administration for adults. The dose frequency for P3 was gradually increased to every 6 days. P7 received an initial infusion of tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg before being switched to the subcutaneous injectable form (162 mg every 2 weeks) for convenience. On this regimen, P7 noted prompt resolution of fevers, abdominal pain, and joint pain, and gradual normalization of lab testing, including CRP, ESR, Hgb, hematologic indices and serum iron. \n\n\n### Exome sequencing \n  \nExome capture (Illumina TruSeq v2 for family 1, Roche SeqCap EZ Exome+UTR for family 2, and IDT xGen Exome Research Panel for family 3) and sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000, 2500 and NovaSeq 6000) was performed for all available family members at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) using 2\u00d7101, 2\u00d7126, and 2x151 bp paired-end reads. The data were analyzed as follows: alignment with Novoalign; duplicate marking with Picard; re-alignment, re-calibration, and variant calling with GATK; and annotation with Annovar. Variants were filtered to select those that were nonsynonymous or in splice sites within 6 base pairs of an exon, had less than 1% mutant allele frequency in variant databases, and co-segregated with the phenotype. The mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing in all family members, and to rule out non-paternity, non-maternity, or other sample identity errors, genders and relatedness were confirmed by examining heterozygous call rates on the X chromosome, Y chromosome call rates, and Mendelian inheritance error rates in the exome data. \n\n\n### In vitro cleavage assays \n  \nUnlabelled   in vitro   transcription and translation of 1 \u03bcg of empty pCMV6-Entry control vector (Origene), wild type   RIPK1   cDNA cloned into pCMV6-Entry vector (Origene), p.D324N, p.D324H, p.D324Y and p.D324A mutant   RIPK1   constructs (GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System, Invitrogen) was performed in a 50 \u03bcl reaction using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). We incubated 2 \u03bcl of this reaction with either 12 U of purified recombinant caspase-8 (Calbiochem), 12 U of purified recombinant caspase-6 (Calbiochem), or an equal volume of re-suspension buffer, in caspase reaction buffer from the Caspase-8 Fluorometric Assay Kit (Enzo Life Sciences) and 10 mM DTT in a 40 \u03bcl final volume at 37 \u00b0C for 3 hours. These reactions were blotted for RIPK1 using an antibody recognizing a RIPK1 C-terminal antibody (610459, BD Transduction Laboratories). \n\n\n### RNA sequencing \n  \nTotal RNA was isolated from whole blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes using PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was used for cDNA library preparation using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit for NeoPrep (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 System in a 1 x 50 bp single read mode. Sequenced reads were mapped against the human reference genome (GRCh38) using hisat v2.2.1.0 . Reads mapped to hemoglobin genes were removed from further analysis. Mapped reads were quantified using HTSeq . All the count data were normalized using TCC  and differentially expressed genes were detected using edgeR . Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID . The original RNA sequencing data is uploaded and available online (Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE127572). \n\n\n### Mice \n  \nAll mouse studies complied with relevant ethical regulations and approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Animal Ethics Committee. The   Ripk1   and   Ripk1   mice were generated by the MAGEC laboratory (WEHI) on a C57BL/6J background. To generate   Ripk1   mice 20 ng/\u03bcl of Cas9 mRNA, 10 ng/\u03bcl of sgRNA (ATTTGACCTGCTCGGAGGTA) and 40 ng/\u03bcl of oligo donor (tgtcttctcattacagAAAGAGTATCCAGATCAAAGCCCAGTGCTGCAGAGAATGTTTTCACTGCAGCATGCCTGTGTACCATTACCTCCGAGCAGGTCAAATTCAGgtaactcacctattcgttcatttgcatactcgctca) were injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized one-cell stage embryos generated from wild type C57BL/6J breeders. To generate   Ripk1   mice 20 ng/\u03bcl of Cas9 mRNA, 10 ng/\u03bcl of sgRNA (TGACAAAGGTGTGATACACA) and 40 ng/\u03bcl of oligo donor (GGATAATCGTGGAGGCCATAGAAGGCATGTGCTACTTACATGACAAAGGTGTGATACACAAGAACCTGAAGCCTGAGAATATCCTCGTTGATCGTGACTTTCACATTAAGgtaatccacaatctg) were injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized one-cell stage embryos generated from   Ripk1   Ripk3   Casp8   breeders. Twenty-four hours later, two-cell stage embryos were transferred into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant female mice. Viable offspring were genotyped by next-generation sequencing. Targeted animals were backcrossed twice to wild type C57BL/6J to eliminate off-target mutations and to re-integrate   Ripk3   and   Casp8   genes into   Ripk1   mice. The   Ripk3  ,   Casp8   and   Mlkl   mice were described previously. The   Ripk3   mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for >10 generations. \n\n\n### TLR challenge \n  \nEight to 12-week-old males received intraperitoneal injection of either 2 mg/kg LPS or 50 \u03bcg of poly(I:C). Calculations to determine group sizes were not performed, mice were not randomized but were grouped according to genotype, and experiments were blinded. \n\n\n### Cells \n  \nMEFs were isolated from E10.5 embryos and MDFs were isolated from mouse tails. After SV40 transformation MEFs and MDFs were tested for mycoplasma. 293T cells (ATCC) used to produce SV40 viruses and in   were tested for mycoplasma but not authenticated. \n\n\n### Time-lapse imaging \n  \nPercentage cell death was assayed every 30-45 mins by time-lapse imaging using the IncuCyte\u00ae live cell analysis imaging (Essenbioscience) or the Opera Phenix\u2122 High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, USA) for 16 hours with 5%CO  and 37\u00b0C climate control. For the IncuCyte\u00ae and Opera Phenix\u2122 dead cells were identified by propidium iodide (PI; 0.25 \u03bcg/ml) staining and for the Opera Phenix\u2122 all cells were stained with 250nM of SiR-DNA (Spirochrome, Switzerland). Dyes were added to the cells 2 hours before imaging and compounds were added 10 minutes before the start of imaging. For the Opera Phenix\u2122, images were analysed using the server based Columbus 2.8.0 software (PerkinElmer, USA) to identify nuclei based on SiR-DNA staining and dead cells using PI staining. Results were exported as counts per well to be processed and graphed using R Studio ( ) with the tidyverse package ( ). \n\n\n### Human and mouse cytokines measurement \n  \nHuman serum and PBMC supernatant cytokine content was measured by ELISA (R&D: SLB50, STA00C and S6050) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The measurements were performed in technical duplicates. Student\u2019s t-test was performed for the statistical analysis. Mouse serum and BMDMs supernatant cytokine content was measured by ELISA (eBioscience for TNF and IL-6 and R&D for IL-1\u03b2) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n\n### Human PBMC ex vivo stimulation \n  \nFicoll-isolated human PBMCs were serum starved for 20 minutes and were stimulated for 3 hours with LPS (Invivogen, tlrl-3pelps) or 6 hours with poly(I:C) (Invivogen, tlrl-pic). Cytokines were measured by ELISA as described above. \n\n\n### Reagents \n  \nThe Smac-mimetic Compound A, the caspase inhibitor IDN-6556 (Idun Pharmaceuticals) and the RIPK1 inhibitor Necrostatin were synthesized by TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals. The RIPK3 inhibitor GSK\u2019872 was from Calbiochem. The TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol, the IKK inhibitor IKK-16 and the MK2 inhibitor PF-3644022 were from Tocris Bioscience. Cycloheximide was from Sigma. Recombinant Fc-TNF was produced in house. Ultrapure LPS-EB and poly(I:C) were purchased from Invivogen. \n\n\n### Immunostaining \n  \nEmbryonic yolk sacs were fixed for 20 minutes at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked and permeabilised in PBS with 2% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) and 0.6% triton X, probed with primary antibodies, cleaved caspase-3 (9661, CST) and PECAM1 (AF3628, R&D Systems) at 4\u2019C overnight, then secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit AF488 (Invitrogen A-11008) and donkey anti-goat cy3 (705-165-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 hour. Samples were cleared in a glycerol gradient (5%-80%) overnight, whole mounted in 80% glycerol and imaged using a DP72 microscope and cellSens Standard software (Olympus). \n\n\n### Immunoprecipitation \n  \nTen million cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes. After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed in DISC lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with 20 \u03bcL of protein G Sepharose plus 1.5 \u03bcg of FADD antibody (clone 7A2, in house) with rotation overnight at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed 4x in DISC and samples eluted by boiling in 60 \u03bcL 1x SDS loading dye. \n\n\n### Western blotting \n  \nCells lysates were separated on 4-12% gradient SDS/polyacrylamide gels (Biorad), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore) membranes and blotted with indicated antibodies purchased from CST except for phospho-RIPK3 (Gift from Genentech), Actin (Sigma) and FADD (clone 7A2, in house).   In vitro   cleavage assays were blotted with a with an anti-RIPK1 antibody recognising the C-terminal part (BD Transduction Laboratories, #610459). Cell lysates were blotted with an anti-RIPK1 antibody recognising the N-terminal part (3493, Cell Signaling Technology). \n\n\n### NF-\u03baB assay in patient-derived cells \n  \nNF-\u03baB activation was assessed by measuring nuclear translocation of subunit p65 in single skin biopsy-derived fibroblasts. Cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates seeded at 16000 cells/well, and treated for 30 minutes with TNF\u03b1 (PeproTech) in PBS containing 1 mM CaCl  and 1 mM MgCl  (PBS-CM). Cells were pre-fixed for 5 minutes with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS-CM, then fixed for 10 minutes with 6% PFA in PBS-CM, and aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH Cl in PBS-CM for 15 minutes. After permeabilization with 0.3% SDS in PBS-CM for 5 minutes, cells were incubated with donkey serum dilution buffer (DSDB: 16% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 0.3M NaCl in PBS) for 30 minutes, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with rabbit monoclonal NF-\u03baB subunit p65 antibody (8242, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted at 1:500 in DSDB. Samples were then washed three times with permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA in PBS) and incubated with a 1:300 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 488 (A21206, Molecular Probes) in DSDB for 1 hour. Nuclei were counter-stained with a 1:2000 dilution of SYTO 59 (Thermo Fisher) for 15 minutes. Automated field selection and plate imaging were performed with an IncuCyte\u00ae Zoom incubator-microscopy system (Essen Bioscience) using a 20X objective. Nine fields per well of 4 wells per subject were pooled for analysis of nuclear p65 signal intensity. Nuclei were marked in red over a phase contrast image, and p65 immunofluorescence was labelled in green. Overlaying a p65 mask on a nuclear mask showed both positive and negative nuclei, and a yellow co-staining mask showed positive nuclei only. \n\n\n\n## Extended Data \n     Inflammatory gene signature in P7 whole blood RNA.  \n a,   MA-plot between two P7 samples and two unrelated adolescent healthy controls, both sequenced with technical duplicates.

Loss of   Ripk3   rescued to E12.5, however 50% of the embryos were abnormal. None of the   Ripk1   Ripk3   mice were born. All observed E11.5   Ripk1   Mlkl   embryos were dead showing that loss of   Mlkl   did not provide any protection. All   Ripk1   Ripk3   Casp8   mice were born and developed ALPS due to loss of   Casp8.  \n\n c  , Kaplan-Meyer survival curves of the indicated genotypes. \n\n d  , Cervical lymph nodes (LN), spleen and thymus of 17-week-old mice of the indicated genotypes.

Unpaired, one-tailed, t-test. \n     Proposed model for RIPK1 D325A-induced cell death  \nTNF binding to TNFR1 triggers complex I formation, in which RIPK1 is ubiquitylated and phosphorylated. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) inhibit RIPK1's cytotoxic activity. Complex I formation activates NF-\u03baB and MAPK-dependent survival genes including   cFlar   encoding cFLIP. Subsequently, a cytosolic Complex II containing FADD, caspase-8, RIPK1, and cFLIP is formed. In this complex cFLIP, inhibits caspase-8 activity so that a restricted number of substrates, such as RIPK1, are cleaved, but others, such as pro-caspase-3 are not. Cleavage of RIPK1 dismantles Complex II. Activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signalling pathways and PTM of RIPK1 combined prevent TNF inducing cell death (left panel top part). Inhibition of NF-\u03baB or MAPK signalling pathways reduces cFLIP levels and accelerates formation of Complex II, and cells die through apoptosis (left panel middle part). When NF-\u03baB/MAPK signalling is disrupted in caspase-8 deficient conditions, RIPK1 is not cleaved and auto-phosphorylates triggering the recruitment of RIPK3 and its auto-phosphorylation. RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL and necroptosis occurs (left panel bottom part). \n\nAccording to this model, lack of RIPK1 cleavage could result in several distinct outcomes. 1. it stabilises Complex II, however, the presence of cFLIP and RIPK1\u2019s inhibitory PTMs prevent caspase-8 from killing. 2. The accumulation of \u2018uncleavable\u2019 RIPK1 recruited to Complex II overrides the inhibitory RIPK1 PTMs. RIPK1 auto-phosphorylates and recruits RIPK3 leading to necroptosis. 3. Alternatively, RIPK1 accumulation results in activated caspase-8 that cleaves RIPK3 and cells survive. 4. Or, stabilisation of Complex II results in recruitment and activation of caspase-8 that induces apoptosis and possibly prevents necroptosis by cleaving RIPK3. 5. Finally, the accumulation of RIPK1 results in activation of both RIPK3 and caspase-8 and therefore induces both an apoptotic and necroptotic cell death. \n\nHow do these potential outcomes match with our data? In homozygote   Ripk1   cells, both caspase-8 and RIPK3 are activated upon TNF suggesting that apoptosis and necroptosis occur at the same time (  and  ). However, surprisingly, according to these models, loss of RIPK3 limits caspase-8 activation ( ). This suggests that recruitment of RIPK3 into complex II increases the recruitment and activation of caspase-8. A precedent for this observation comes from experiments utilising RIPK3 inhibitors, that were shown to promote RIPK1 dependent caspase-8 activation , in a mode that we would term \"reverse activation\". In our experiments however RIPK3 activation occurs downstream of TNF signalling, suggesting that reverse activation might represent a physiological amplification loop that increases caspase-8 activation. Yet, this requirement for RIPK3 is not present in all cells as embryonic lethality of the RIPK1 cleavage mutant is only partially rescued by loss of   Ripk3.   In the heterozygote   Ripk1   cells, caspase-8 cleaves wild type RIPK1 limiting TNF induced cell death when compared to homozygote cells. However, reduction of cFLIP and/or RIPK1\u2019s PTM by treatment with IAP, TAK1, IKK or translational inhibitors decreases the threshold of TNF sensitivity ( ).

Remarkably, nearly all species (223) have a potential caspase cleavage site, D300, however it is noteworthy that this Asp is in most cases succeeded by a large hydrophobic amino acid which is less favourable for caspase cleavage. \n  \n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6930849, "text_md5": "6a5ee69301a9eed8c80280df573fdc31", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 1118], "journal": [1119, 1125], "publication_year": [1127, 1131], "title": [1142, 1221], "keywords": [1235, 1235], "abstract": [1248, 2982], "body": [2991, 41011]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31827281, "doi": "10.1038/s41586-019-1828-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6930849", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6930849"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6930849\">6930849</a>", "list_title": "PMC6930849  Mutations that prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 cause autoinflammatory disease"}

During each session, a mirror is used to view the reflected image of the intact limb moving, providing visual feedback consistent with the movement of the missing/phantom limb. To investigate potential neural correlates of the treatment effect, we measured brain responses in volunteers with unilateral leg amputation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a four-week course of mirror therapy. Mirror therapy commenced immediately following baseline scans, which were repeated after approximately two and four week intervals. We focused on responses in the region of sensorimotor cortex corresponding to primary somatosensory and motor representations of the missing leg. At baseline, prior to starting therapy, we found a strong and unexpected response in sensorimotor cortex of amputees to visually presented images of limbs. This response was stronger for images of feet compared to hands and there was no such response in matched controls. Further, this response to visually presented limbs was no longer present at the end of the four week mirror therapy treatment, when perceived phantom limb pain was also reduced. A similar pattern of results was also observed in extrastriate and parietal regions typically responsive to viewing hand actions, but not in regions corresponding to secondary somatosensory cortex. Finally, there was a significant correlation between initial visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex and reduction in PLP suggesting a potential marker for predicting efficacy of mirror therapy. Thus, enhanced visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex is associated with PLP and modulated over the course of mirror therapy. \n   Highlights  \n  \nVisual responsiveness to the sight of limbs in sensorimotor cortex of leg amputees but not matched controls \n  \nConsistent with prior studies, mirror therapy over 4 weeks reduced phantom limb pain \n  \nVisual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex of amputees diminished following mirror therapy \n  \nVisual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex might be useful in predicting the potential efficacy of mirror therapy \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver 90% of amputees experience vivid pain in the missing limb, frequently referred to as phantom limb pain (PLP), which can be experienced within 24\u202fh following amputation ( ). For example, some upper limb amputees have reported that the finger nails of their phantom limb were digging into their palm, while others reported that their phantom hands were stuck in an awkward, immobile position and were hurting ( ). Multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to account for such pain including a mismatch between visual feedback and proprioceptive representations of the limb ( ;  ), neuroplasticity ( ,  ;  ;  ;   but see  ), proprioceptive memory ( ;  ;  ), or the maintenance of sensorimotor representations of the missing limb ( ;  ). Importantly, providing visual feedback consistent with the movement of the phantom limb using mirror therapy has been found to dramatically reduce PLP ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These ameliorative effects of mirror therapy appear to be specific to the visual feedback, since reductions in pain are not observed when the mirror is covered or the amputees engage in mental visualization of movements only ( ). To elucidate why mirror therapy reduces PLP and identify potential neural correlates, we conducted an exploratory longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 9 lower leg amputees prior to, during, and following four weeks of mirror therapy treatment ( ).   \nExperimental design. a) Immediately following a baseline fMRI scan, amputee participants started approximately four weeks of mirror therapy. The second and third scan sessions were conducted at approximately two-week intervals. Age- and gender-matched control participants underwent the same series of scans at the same time intervals. b) During each scan session, participants viewed images of hands and feet from the left or right side of the body in a block design. Within each block, limb and side of body were fixed and images from each side were presented in the congruent screen location (e.g., left foot on left side of screen). Only one image was presented at a time, and participants were asked to fixate at the center of the screen throughout each scan. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nPrior fMRI studies have reported shifts in somatosensory maps in upper extremity amputees with, for example, movement of the lips producing responses extending into the putative hand representation ( ;  ;  ;  ). These extended responses were found to be specific to amputees with PLP compared to those without ( ) and have been interpreted as evidence for maladaptive cortical reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex. However, more recent work ( ) has reported only a small shift in cortical representations of the lip and no clear relationship between the extent of apparent reorganization and phantom sensations or pain. In contrast to these prior studies, and given the importance of visual feedback for the potential beneficial effect of mirror therapy, we focused primarily on responses to visually presented images of hands and feet rather than motor-related responses. Immediately following a baseline fMRI scan, amputees started 15-min daily sessions of mirror therapy following our previous protocol ( ). Specifically, during each session, amputees placed a mirror between their intact and missing/phantom leg, and moved both of their legs simultaneously. While looking at the mirror, the reflection of the intact leg moving in the mirror produces visual feedback consistent with the movement of the missing leg. The second and third fMRI sessions were conducted after approximately two-week intervals ( ). A group of matched control participants without limb amputation underwent the same series of fMRI scans but did not receive mirror therapy. We found strong responses to visually presented limbs in the sensorimotor cortex of amputees that was no longer present by the end of the mirror therapy treatment. Such responses to visually presented limbs were not observed in matched control participants indicating that loss of sensorimotor input such as major limb amputation can modify sensorimotor representations. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Overview \n  \nIn this study, amputee and control participants participated in three MRI sessions. In each MRI session, we measured the cortical responses to visual presentations of the feet and hands. In particular, we focused on sensorimotor cortex, corresponding to the somatomotor representations of the lower limb. This region of sensorimotor cortex was defined in the control participants using a combination of functional and anatomical markers. Immediately following the first MRI session, amputee participants started on daily sessions of mirror therapy and reported their level of subjective PLP using standard questionnaires. There were three main questions of interest: i) What is the impact of amputation on visual responsiveness in cortex? ii) What is the impact of mirror therapy on visual responsiveness? iii) How does visual responsiveness compare with any reduction in PLP? \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nNine right-handed unilateral lower limb amputees (5 male, 4 female, 3 left lower limb, 6 right lower limb, mean age\u202f=\u202f50) were recruited from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Washington, DC, or the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Diabetes, traumatic brain injury, and dysvascular cause of amputation were exclusion factors. All amputees reported taking medications (including opioids, voltage-gated calcium channel modulators and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). Nonetheless, all reported that pain medication(s) were not effective in treating PLP and all reported ongoing vivid PLP. Participants were asked to maintain a constant medication regime throughout the study. Nine healthy control participants without limb amputation (mean age\u202f=\u202f44) were recruited through the National Institutes of Health. We attempted to match for the age and gender of amputees within these control participants to avoid any large demographic differences between groups. All comparisons between amputees and control participants were made at the group level and analyzed in an unpaired manner. See   for participants' demographics. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave written informed consent. The study was approved by both the National Institutes of Health and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Institutional Review Boards.   \nDemographics of amputees and matched control participants. \n  Table 1   \n\nIn MRI sessions before and after starting mirror therapy ( ), each participant completed both functional and structural scans. Functional scans included the viewing of visually presented limbs, bodies, or common objects, as well as a motor localizer run to locate the relevant sensorimotor regions. \n\n\n### Visual representations for hands and feet \n  \nA block design experiment containing single-images of hands and feet in an egocentric view was used ( ). Each stimulus (5 degrees), left hand/ft in the left visual field and right hand/ft in the right visual field, was centered 3 degrees from fixation. Each block lasted 16\u202fs and comprised 20 trials (0.8\u202fs total duration; 0.5\u202fs stimulus plus 0.3\u202fs blank). Within each run a total of 16 stimulus blocks were presented plus a 16\u202fs fixation period every four stimulus blocks as well as at the beginning and end of the run. The total for each run amounted to 5 mins 32\u202fs. Participants were required to maintain fixation throughout the run. \n\n\n### Localizing the sensorimotor regions \n  \nSensorimotor regions for the foot were defined by a combination of anatomical and functional markers. Although, prior work with amputees has sometimes used the response to movement of the phantom to define regions-of-interest (ROIs), we defined our ROIs using data only from control participants to ensure equivalent ROIs in the two groups. While phantom limb movements can elicit muscle activity similar to controls and engage sensorimotor cortex ( ;  ), it is not clear that movement of the phantom produces equivalent cortical responses to executed movement from an intact limb. For example, differences in the difficulty of moving the phantom have been associated with the strength of PLP and differing levels of activity in motor cortex ( ,  ). Further, any changes in somatosensory or motor representations as a result of amputation might be reflected in the activity observed with phantom movement in amputees. Here, we are principally interested in changes in visual responses in the cortical region that would have represented the amputated limb prior to amputation and want to compare equivalent regions in the two groups of subjects. Finally, some of the amputees had difficulty moving the phantom in isolation and would sometimes move other associated body parts, which would lead to different activation across sensorimotor cortex compared to controls. \n\nA block design experiment comprising three conditions was used to identify cortical regions with selective activation during motor movement. Participants were prompted by simple instructions in the center of a viewing screen (simple phrases, e.g. left foot, right foot), which were flashed at a rate of one Hz. Participants were required to either gently perform flexion and extension movement with their left or right foot or contract gluteal muscles for 10\u202fs at one Hz. The gluteal movement condition was included to potentially allow isolation of the cortical representation of the body map adjacent to the lower limb representation. However, participants (especially amputees) had a lot of difficulty making these movements without also simultaneously moving their legs and therefore we focused only on the lower limb region. \n\nThere were 18 blocks within each run, and each condition appeared six times in a counterbalanced order. Each block lasted for 10\u202fs followed by fixation (rest period 6 or 16\u202fs). In addition a 16\u202fs fixation block was added to the beginning and the end of the scan. In total each run lasted for 4\u202fmin 42\u202fs. Participants were instructed to maintain fixation and keep their body still during the rest period. \n\nFunctionally, we contrasted Right Foot Movement vs Left Foot Movement at a threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f10  (random effect) from 14 control participants (including the 9 participants who were matched to the amputees) across all three scan sessions (  N  \u202f=\u202f42). Anatomically, we defined a region using the Freesurfer parcellation for the central sulcus, pre-central gyrus and the paracentral gyrus. Individual foot sensorimotor ROIs were created by extracting the intersection of these functionally and anatomically defined regions. The ROIs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and correspond very well to the recently reported 7\u202fT mapping data of the lower limb ( ). These ROIs were then used to extract visual responses from both the control and PLP groups. \n\n\n### Control ROIs: limb-related regions in ventral and dorsal visual pathways \n  \nA block design localizer containing images of limbs and common objects was used to identify cortical regions that are selective to visual presentation of limbs, namely the extrastriate body area (EBA), to serve as a control ROI for the sensorimotor regions. Images were photos of limbs or objects taken from various angles. All stimuli were presented in the center of the screen. Twelve alternating blocks of limbs and object images subtending 5 degrees were presented in the center of the screen. In addition, a fixation block was presented at the beginning and end of the scan. Each block lasted for 16\u202fs, and each localizer run lasted a total of 3\u202fmin 44\u202fs. Participants were required to maintain fixation throughout the scan. In addition, limb-related superior and inferior parietal regions along the dorsal pathway were defined using previously identified ROIs ( ). These ROIs (  N  \u202f=\u202f40) were defined by contrasting responses during blocks of a movie clip of a hand being brushed by a paint brush versus blocks of a movie clip of the background (no hand) being brushed with the same motion. \n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nAll participants were scanned on a General Electric 3-Tesla Signa scanner located in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Whole brain volumes were acquired using an 8-channel head coil (30 slices, 64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64 matrix, FoV\u202f=\u202f200\u202f\u00d7\u202f200\u202fmm, in-plane resolution 3.125\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.125\u202fmm, slice thickness 4\u202fmm, 0.4\u202fmm inter-slice gap, TR\u202f=\u202f2\u202fs, TE\u202f=\u202f30\u202fmsec). For each participant, a high-resolution anatomical scan was also acquired. All functional localizer and event-related runs were interleaved. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nData were analyzed with the AFNI software package ( ). Prior to statistical analysis, the first and last eight volumes of each run were removed, and all images were motion-corrected to the eighth volume of the first run. Following motion correction, images from the localizer runs were smoothed with a 5\u202fmm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Cortical surfaces were created using FreeSurfer ( ) and functional data were then displayed on cortical surfaces using SUMA ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI statistical analysis \n  \nUsing independent functional localizers, ROIs were generated using the random effect group analysis from control participants across all three scan sessions. Specifically, ROIs in the sensorimotor regions (primary and secondary) in each hemisphere were created from the motor localizers with the contrast of \u201cLeft vs Right Foot Movement\u201d (  p  \u202f<\u202f10 ). Since motor movement from the missing limb could not be reliably produced, this group sensorimotor and SII ROIs from the Controls were served as localizers for the PLP group as well. Further, EBA ROIs from the visual localizer were defined by contrasting limbs versus common objects (p\u202f<\u202f10 ). All ROIs were generated from these maps by taking the contiguous clusters of voxels that exceeded threshold and occupied the approximate anatomical location based on prior reports. Using a standard GLM procedure in the experimental runs we examined the magnitude of response (beta values) within each ROI to all conditions. The responses in each experimental condition were then extracted from each ROI and compared using statistical tests, such as ANOVAs and paired   t  -tests. \n\n\n### Visual mirror therapy \n  \nAmputee participants were asked to complete 4\u202fweeks of visual mirror therapy, 15\u202fmin per day, 5\u202fdays/week. Participants were instructed to place a mirror between their lower limbs and to perform movements with their intact and phantom limbs simultaneously while looking at the reflection of the intact limb moving in the mirror. All amputees reported that they could feel their missing leg and were able to control the movement of the missing/phantom limb. The movements were 5\u202fmin of foot flexion and extension, 5\u202fmin of inward ankle rotation, and 5\u202fmin of outward ankle rotation. Participants reported average PLP daily using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with one end labeled \u201cno pain\u201d and the other end labeled \u201cmost severe pain.\u201d \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo illustrate the pattern of results we observed, we first present whole-brain data from one representative amputee before presenting data analyses at the group level. LA1 was a 57-year old male at the time of the study, with an amputation below the left knee 2\u202fyears previously due to infection. Consistent with prior reports ( ;  ), his perceived pain level, as measured using a 10-cm VAS, diminished over the course of mirror therapy ( a). During the baseline fMRI scan we observed an unexpected response to visual presentation of left foot images (corresponding to the amputated foot) in sensorimotor cortex, close to the putative foot representation at the dorsal end of the central sulcus, likely corresponding to primary somatosensory and motor cortex ( b). The initial measured responses appeared to be specific both to the type of limb (with stronger responses to a foot than a hand) and to the side of the body (with stronger responses to a foot corresponding to the amputated side than to an intact foot from the other side of the body). Further, such responses were not observed in the matched control participant, as expected for static presentation of pictures of limbs ( ;  ). This visual response to images corresponding to the amputated limb declined over the course of mirror therapy, and by the third fMRI session, visual responses in sensorimotor cortex were no longer observed.   \nImprovement in pain symptoms. a) Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score over the course of the mirror therapy in a single participant (LA1). b) Group averaged VAS scores for the days corresponding to the scan sessions, demonstrating a significant reduction in PLP from scan 1 to scans 2 and 3. ** p\u202f<\u202f.001 indicates significant difference in VAS level between scans. Error bars show the standard error of the mean. \n  Fig. 2     \nResponses to visually presented limbs for a single amputee participant (LA1) and the matched control (C1). a) Baseline scan for the matched control participant showing no significant activation near the sensorimotor foot representation at the dorsal end of the central sulcus (white boundaries). Results were similar for the second and third scan sessions. b) During the baseline scan for the amputee participant, significant activation was observed in and around the central sulcus, corresponding to the typical location of the foot representation in sensorimotor cortex defined in the control group (light blue boundaries). This activation was observed for the visual presentation of a foot, but not hand, from the side of the body corresponding to the amputation (left foot). These responses diminished over the course of the three scan sessions, concomitant with the reduction in pain scores, and there was no significant activation in or around the central sulcus in the third session. Activations are projected onto the inflated brain surface reconstructed from each participant's own brain volume. \n  Fig. 3   \n\nThis general pattern of visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex at baseline that was much reduced by the end of mirror therapy was seen in most amputees, although the effect of type of limb (hand versus foot) and side of body (amputated versus intact) was not consistent across amputees. PLP reduction over the course of mirror therapy was observed in all except one of the amputees. Overall, VAS scores on the day of each fMRI session showed an average of 46% reduction from Session 1 to Session 3 ( b). A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA confirmed the reduction in subjective pain over the course of mirror therapy, F(2,14)\u202f=\u202f12.237,   p  \u202f<\u202f.001. \n\nTo examine the effects of amputation and mirror therapy on cortical responses across the group of amputees, we identified the putative cortical foot representations in and around the central sulcus using a combination of anatomical and functional constraints (see Methods). This region includes both primary somatosensory and motor areas. Using this ROI we extracted responses to the visual presentation of hands and feet in both amputees and their matched controls. As with the representative amputee presented above, on average across the group we found responses to visually presented limbs in sensorimotor cortex at baseline that were no longer present by the end of mirror therapy ( ).   \nGroup average changes in visual responsiveness in the sensorimotor foot representation. a) Across the group of amputees there was an elevated response to visually presented limbs in the sensorimotor representation of the foot (identified using foot movements in the matched control participants) during the baseline scan session. These responses were greater for the foot than the hand and were no longer present in Session 3. b) There was no significant response to visually presented limbs in the control participants in any session.* indicates significant difference from zero (  p  \u202f<\u202f.05). \n  Fig. 4   \n\nTo examine the fMRI responses, we conducted statistical analysis across sessions, comparing both PLP and control groups. However, one of our PLP participants was only scanned in Sessions 1 and 3. Given our already limited sample size, we therefore focused on Sessions 1 and 3 only to maximize power ( ). However, the pattern of results does not change when including only those participants scanned in all 3 Sessions (Supplementary Fig. 2) and details of the statistical analysis across all three Sessions are provided in supplementary material.   \nSummary of the data entered into the main statistical analysis in sensorimotor cortex, collapsed across hemisphere and side. The 5-way ANOVA revealed an interaction between Group, Limb, and Session. Follow-up paired   t  -tests directly compared responses for Limb across Group within each Session separately. For Foot, there was a significant difference in Session 1 (t(1,8)\u202f=\u202f2.59,   p  \u202f<\u202f.032, two-tailed) but not Session 3 (t(1,8)\u202f=\u202f0.73, p\u202f<\u202f.49, two-tailed). For Hand, there was no significant difference in either Session (all   p  \u202f<\u202f.12, two-tailed). * indicates significant difference between conditions or significant difference from zero, while n.s. indicates non-significant difference between pairs of conditions. \n  Fig. 5   \n\nA 5-way ANOVA with Group (Control, PLP), Hemisphere (Contralateral, Ipsilateral to missing limb), Session (Scan 1, 3), Side (Missing, Intact), and Limb (Foot, Hand) as factors revealed a significant three-way interaction between Session, Limb and Group (F(1,16)\u202f=\u202f7.07,   p  \u202f<\u202f.017). No other main effects or interactions were observed (all F\u202f<\u202f3.626,   p  \u202f>\u202f.074). There were no effects involving Hemisphere, with similar results in both hemispheres (contra- and ipsilateral to the amputation). \n\nTo better understand the nature of this three-way interaction, we conducted follow-up analyses focusing separately on each Group and each Session. First, two-way ANOVAs within each Group with Session and Limb as factors (collapsing across Side and Hemisphere) revealed a significant main effect of Session in the PLP group (F(1,8)\u202f=\u202f5.51,   p  \u202f<\u202f.047) but not the Control group (F(1,8)\u202f=\u202f0.053,   p  \u202f<\u202f.82), confirming the reduction in visual responses for the amputees over the course of mirror therapy. However, the interaction between Session and Limb did not reach significance in the PLP group (1,8)\u202f=\u202f4.08,   p  \u202f<\u202f.078). \n\nSecond, separate analyses for each Session, revealed a significant interaction of Limb and Group within Session 1 (F(1,8)\u202f=\u202f5.47,   p  \u202f<\u202f.048), reflecting stronger responses to the foot than the hand in the amputees but not the controls. However, in Session 3 there were no significant differences between the two groups and no interactions (all F\u202f<\u202f0.96,   p  \u202f>\u202f.20). \n\nFollow-up paired   t  -tests directly compared responses to each limb between groups for each Session (see  ), revealing stronger responses in the PLP compared to Control group for seeing the foot in Session 1 (t(1,8)\u202f=\u202f2.59, p 0.032, two-tailed), but not Session 3 (t(1,8)\u202f=\u202f0.73,   p  \u202f<\u202f.49, two-tailed). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups for seeing the hand in either Session 1 or Session 3 (all   p  \u202f>\u202f.12, two-tailed). \n\nThe reduction in visual responsiveness from Session 1 to Session 3 was highly consistent across participants ( ) and was observed in all but one of the amputees.   \nIndividual participants' responses from sensorimotor foot region, illustrating changes in responses across Sessions 1 and 3 in controls and amputees (  n  \u202f=\u202f9). All amputees (except one) showed much sharper reduction in responses from Session 1 to Session 3, relative to controls. \n  Fig. 6   \n\nThus, our results demonstrate an initial enhanced visual responsiveness in the sensorimotor cortex in the PLP group compared to the Control group, which is specific for the amputated (foot) compared to the unaffected limbs (either hand, intact foot) in Session 1. Further, this visual responsiveness was reduced following visual feedback through mirror therapy, suggesting that prolonged visual experience corresponding to the missing limb modulates these atypical visual responses. \n\nTo investigate the specificity of our results to the primary sensorimotor regions, we examined. \n\nresponses in other sensorimotor regions, in particular the secondary somatosensory area (SII). Our localizer for the sensorimotor foot representation also revealed a region close to the parietal operculum, which likely corresponds to SII. We extracted responses from this region and performed the same analyses as for the primary sensorimotor region described above. The 5-way ANOVA with Group (Control, PLP), Hemisphere (Contralateral, Ipsilateral to missing limb), Session (Scan 1, 3), Side (Missing, Intact), and Limb (Foot, Hand) as factors revealed no significant main effects or interactions. Furthermore, responses to the visual presentation of feet and hands in the PLP group were not significantly elevated over baseline (all   t  \u202f<\u202f0.20,   p  \u202f>\u202f.23, two-tailed). Thus, we found no evidence of visual responsiveness in SII in either the PLP or the Control groups ( ). A 6-way ANOVA with ROI (Sensorimotor, SII), Group (Control, PLP), Hemisphere (Contralateral, Ipsilateral to missing limb), Session (Scan 1, 3), Side (Missing, Intact), and Limb (Foot, Hand) as factors showed no significant interaction of ROI x Session x Limb x Group (F(1,16)\u202f=\u202f3.380,   p  \u202f<\u202f.085). No other main effects or interactions were found.   \nResponses to visually presented limbs in the parietal operculum region (likely corresponding to SII) between PLP and Control groups. In contrast to primary sensorimotor cortex, there were no significant responses to visually presented limbs in any Session and no change over time. n.s. indicates non-significant difference between pairs of conditions. \n  Fig. 7   \n\nWe primarily focused on the sensorimotor cortex given prior results suggesting reorganization in this region in upper limb amputees. To test whether the impact of mirror therapy on the visual responses to limbs in the PLP group was observed only in sensorimotor cortex, we also analyzed the responses in other regions associated with representations of the body. Specifically, we examined the Extrastriate Body Area (EBA;  ,  ;  ;  ), which is selectively responsive to the sight of body parts, as well as two regions in posterior parietal cortex that are responsive to the sight of the body being touched/brushed, but not to static limb images ( ). Given our prior results which showed no effect of hemisphere or side, for each region ( ) we conducted a 3-way ANOVA with Group (PLP, Control), Session (1, 3), and Limb (Hands, Feet) as factors. In each region there was a significant interaction of Session and Group (EBA: F(1,16)\u202f=\u202f6.327,   p  \u202f<\u202f.023; superior parietal: F(1,16)\u202f=\u202f6.000,   p  \u202f<\u202f.026; inferior parietal: F(1,16)\u202f=\u202f5.883,   p  \u202f<\u202f.027), reflecting reduced visual responsiveness to images of both hands and feet from Session 1 to Session 3 in the PLP but not the control group. However, in contrast to the sensorimotor cortex, the pattern of results in all three regions was similar for both hands and feet. In the superior and inferior parietal regions, as in sensorimotor cortex, the visual responsiveness observed in Session 1 of amputees was absent in control participants. In EBA, which is normally responsive to images of static body parts, the initial response was not statistically different between the PLP and the control groups. Thus, the enhanced responsiveness to visually presented limbs is also observed in posterior parietal cortex and a change in visual responsiveness over the course of mirror therapy is also found in posterior parietal cortex and EBA, although the specificity to the type of limb (foot versus hand) was only observed in sensorimotor cortex.   \nResponses to visually presented limbs in (a) superior parietal, (b) inferior parietal and (c) EBA regions-of-interest. In all three regions there was a significant interaction between Group and Session, reflecting reduced responses in Session 3 compared to Session 1 for the PLP group. However, in contrast to sensorimotor cortex, the pattern of results was similar for both hands and feet. * indicates significant difference between conditions or significant difference from zero, while n.s. indicates non-significant difference between pairs of conditions. \n  Fig. 8   \n\nMirror therapy is not efficacious for all amputees   (  ;  ;   )  . If the visual responsiveness of sensorimotor cortex is related to the experience of PLP, it might provide a useful marker for the potential efficacy of mirror therapy. Thus, in an exploratory analysis we investigated whether activation of the sensorimotor ROIs (averaged across the sensorimotor foot ROIs in both hemispheres) in Session 1 for the presentation of an image of the hand or foot (corresponding to the amputated side or intact side) correlated with treatment response, as measured by reduction in PLP (VAS S1 to S3). We found a significant correlation between seeing an image of the foot corresponding to the amputated side and a reduction in PLP (Spearman's   r  \u202f=\u202f0.703,   p  \u202f<\u202f.035, two-tailed), suggesting that amputees who have stronger initial responses for viewing the foot image corresponding to their amputated foot have a greater reduction in PLP following four weeks of mirror therapy ( ). However, there was no correlation between responses for viewing the intact foot and reduction in PLP, despite the lack of an effect of side on fMRI responses (Spearman's   r  \u202f=\u202f0.167,   p  \u202f<\u202f.667, two-tailed). We conducted a further exploratory follow-up analysis excluding those amputees who had their amputation surgery >10\u202fyears ago (LA 2 and 5) and the correlation between reduction in PLP and visual responsiveness in the sensorimotor region remained significant (Spearman's   r  \u202f=\u202f0.786,   p  \u202f<\u202f.036, two-tailed). We did not find any significant correlation between responses in EBA and reduction in PLP (Spearman's   r  \u202f<\u202f0.569, all   p  \u202f>\u202f.11, two-tailed).   \nVisual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex predicts pain relief from mirror therapy. Within each amputee, visual responses to the foot extracted from sensorimotor cortex correlates with the reduction in PLP (normalized VAS z-scores Session1 minus Session 3), demonstrating that the stronger the initial visual responses in Session 1 for seeing the amputated foot, the better the therapeutic outcome (Spearman's   r  \u202f=\u202f0.70,   p  \u202f<\u202f.035, two-tailed). \n  Fig. 9   \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCollectively, our findings provide insight into the impact of amputation and the previously reported beneficial effect of mirror therapy. First, consistent with prior reports, we found that mirror therapy reduced perceived PLP, where we have previously found that mirror therapy was more effective than imagined movement or movement of the phantom limb in the absence of the mirror component ( ). Second, we demonstrate an atypical responsiveness to visually presented limbs in sensorimotor cortical regions corresponding to the somatosensory and motor representations of the foot. Third, visual responsiveness was also enhanced in posterior parietal cortex but we found no evidence for visual activation in SII. Fourth, the visual responsiveness decreased by the end of the treatment when PLP was also reduced. Finally, the extent of visual responsiveness at baseline correlated with the reduction in PLP, suggesting that it could potentially be a marker for the likely efficacy of mirror therapy. \n\nVisual responses are not typically reported in sensorimotor cortex of healthy individuals, especially to static images. There have been reports of responses to the sight of touch in somatosensory areas ( ;  ,  ;  ,  ,  ), but in an earlier study we found that the sight of a hand being brushed elicited responses in regions of posterior parietal cortex that did not overlap with the somatosensory representations of the hand ( ), with similar results recently reported in monkeys ( ). There is also some evidence for decoding of visual objects based on the pattern of responses in somatosensory regions (e.g.,  ;  ), but the univariate responses in these studies are very weak. Consistent with this prior literature ( ;  ;  ), we did not observe any responses to the sight of static hands and feet in sensorimotor cortex of our control participants in any session. Thus, the strong responsiveness to visually presented limbs (particularly the amputated limb) appears to be a specific effect following major limb amputation. This atypical visual responsiveness following amputation may reflect unmasking of pre-existing connections between visual areas in parietal cortex and sensorimotor cortices ( ), rather than being due to functional re-purposing by other modalities (i.e., the sensorimotor cortex now becoming a visual region). Such unmasking has also been suggested to underlie changes in receptive field properties in visual cortex following deprivation of visual input ( ;  ). Consistent with this view, visual perception can be disrupted very rapidly following the onset of deprivation, too quickly for any structural changes to arise in the cortex ( ). \n\nOur results suggest that visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex may be a consequence of amputation. However, we do not think there is a simple, one-to-one causal relationship between visual responsiveness and the level of PLP. For example, while we observed a clear drop in PLP from Session 1 to Session 2, there was not an equivalent drop in the visual responsiveness observed. However, the increased responsiveness was largely specific to primary sensorimotor regions and was not observed in the putative SII. Somewhat surprisingly, we found no difference in sensorimotor cortex response between the hemispheres, although it might have been expected that any effects would be specific to the hemisphere contralateral to the amputation. This lack of hemispheric specificity may reflect strong connectivity between the sensorimotor cortices via the corpus callosum ( ;  ;  ). We also observed enhanced responsiveness to visually presented limbs in posterior parietal cortex, but this effect was not specific to the limb, in contrast to our results in primary sensorimotor regions. While our findings do not provide a direct link between the atypical visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex and PLP, this visual responsiveness was reduced over the course of treatment, and by the end of treatment both visual responsiveness and pain were reduced. Further, the magnitude of visual responsiveness at baseline correlated with the amount of pain reduction following 4\u202fweeks of mirror therapy. This reduction in visual responsiveness suggests that one impact of mirror therapy may be to modulate visual influences on sensorimotor cortex, perhaps by altering intracortical inhibition ( ;  ). \n\nIt is important to consider alternative interpretations of our findings. One possibility is that the presence of chronic pain associated with the amputation has increased the salience of visually presented limbs corresponding to the amputated limb, increased visual attention. The fact that increased responses were observed in multiple regions in both hemispheres with some decrease over the sessions could be taken to support this view. However, we do not think that a change in salience causing a gain in responses provides an easy explanation for our results. First, it is important to note that there is no observable response to the visual stimuli in the sensorimotor cortex of the control participants, so no pre-existing response for saliency to enhance. Second, the effects we observed were not uniform across all regions. In particular while responses were stronger for feet over hands in sensorimotor cortex, in other regions there was no obvious difference between feet and hands. Another possibility is that amputees may have been more likely to mentally image a limb moving when viewing images of limbs producing activation in sensorimotor cortex. However, we think this is unlikely. First, the visual stimulation was of static limbs, which should have minimized any tendency to imagine movement. Second, it's not clear to us that any such tendency should have been greater in the amputees compared to the controls. Finally, any tendency to imagine a limb moving would, if anything, have increased over the course of the mirror training as amputees were trained to move their phantom simultaneous with visual stimulation. Nevertheless, future work will need to test these potential hypotheses. \n\nPrior work has investigated whether PLP is related to plasticity of somatosensory and motor maps ( ) with a shift in the cortical representation of the lips toward the representation of the missing hand. However, the extent of these effects has recently been questioned ( ), and fine-scale topography of the hand appears to be maintained in somatosensory and motor cortex following hand amputation ( ). Our findings, combined with evidence for network-level reorganization with amputation ( ), suggest there may be widespread changes following loss of sensory input, but in the context of maintained cortical representation of the missing limb. The tendency for representation to be maintained has recently been linked to the severity of PLP ( ) and the visual responses we observed could potentially be one driving force for the maintenance of this representation. \n\nWhile our study provides some insight into the effects of amputation on sensorimotor cortex and suggests potential neural correlates of pain reduction through visual training (i.e. mirror therapy), there are a number of limitations that should be taken into account. First, our sample size (9 amputees for Sessions 1 and 3, 8 in all three Sessions) is quite small and while we did observe significant and consistent visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex of amputees in Session 1 and reductions in visual responsiveness from Session 1 to Session 3 in all but one amputee, there is also quite a lot of variability in the data. Thus, we may not have had sufficient power to detect smaller effects in the data, and the correlation we observed between visual responsiveness in Session 1 and efficacy of mirror therapy remains preliminary. Further, this small sample size means that we cannot meaningfully ask questions about the effects of factors such as age and time since amputation on our results. Second, in contrast to much of the prior published literature examining changes in upper limb amputees, we focused on lower limb amputees. Given the smaller cortical representation of the leg and foot compared to the arm and hand, we may not have had sufficient sensitivity to detect changes and it is difficult to directly relate our findings to those in arm amputees. Third, we had no amputee control group receiving other treatments. Thus we cannot rule out that the effects we observed would also have occurred with those alternative treatments or the effect of time. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the potential importance of examining visual responses to the body in amputees and future work will be needed to establish the robustness of our findings and whether similar effects are observed in arm amputees. \n\nWhile a number of studies and groups have independently demonstrated a benefit from using mirror therapy in the treatment of phantom limb pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), other groups have not reported similar successes ( ;  ;  ;  ). In this study we followed mirror therapy treatment protocols that had previously been shown to be effective compared with limb movements alone (mirror covered) or imagined movement in a randomized, controlled, cross-over design ( ). It is worth noting that the impact of mirror therapy may not be entirely consistent across amputees due to the heterogeneity of the population, and it is known that some amputees do not benefit from mirror therapy even after 4\u202fweeks of treatment ( ; Griffin et al., 2017). There are wide variations in the location, timing, cause, and age at the time of amputation. All of these may have influence on the effectiveness of mirror therapy. It is also worth noting that those groups which did not report PLP reduction employed only a single session of mirror therapy ( ;  ), whereas the studies demonstrating efficacy of the therapy had sustained treatment sessions of a period of time. Recently, it was reported that amputee with greater severity of PLP require a longer duration of treatment (more sessions) before an effect can be seen, compared to fewer treatment sessions required for pain reduction in amputees with less severe phantom pain (Griffin et al., 2017), and this finding likely affects the negative conclusions drawn from analyses of prior studies ( ;  ). Future studies should also examine why some amputees do not derive benefit from mirror therapy whereas many others experience complete pain relief. \n\nIn conclusion, we report atypical responsiveness to visually presented limbs in sensorimotor cortex that reduces over the course of 4\u202fweeks of mirror therapy seems to associate with a reduction in phantom pain. Such visual responsiveness found in the PLP group could potentially be a neural correlate or biomarker for quantifying the impact of major limb amputation and the likely efficacy of visual mirror therapy. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6587025, "text_md5": "198a4e46e0a8b99d73cd862f235f50b0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 181], "journal": [182, 197], "publication_year": [199, 203], "title": [214, 325], "keywords": [339, 393], "abstract": [406, 2692], "body": [2701, 44314]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31226622, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101882", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6587025", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6587025"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6587025\">6587025</a>", "list_title": "PMC6587025  Visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex is increased following amputation and reduced after mirror therapy"}

However, the complexities of current protocols limit the use of this in vitro system in applications requiring large-scale production of organoids. Currently, widely used methods require the isolation of presumed optic vesicle-like structures from adherent cultures by dissection, a labor-intensive and time-consuming step that involves extensive practice and training. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nWe report a simple and efficient method for generating ROs by scraping the entire adherent culture and growing the resulting cell aggregates in a free-floating condition. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWithin 1 to 7 days following the procedure, emerging morphologically well-defined optic vesicles can be identified and harvested with ease. The transition from two-dimensional (2D) to 3D culture condition favored the formation of ROs from areas devoid of typical optic vesicle-like structures, thus increasing the RO yield. Moreover, ROs generated by this approach were more often associated with the pigment epithelium. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis improved, robust, and efficient protocol should facilitate large-scale differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into retinal organoids in support of human disease modeling and therapy development. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHereditary retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis, are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions that lead to progressive loss of vision [ , ]. Currently, few therapeutic options are available, at least in part, due to the physiologic differences between human and animal models and the lack of in vitro systems to efficiently evaluate therapies. With advances in three-dimensional (3D) culture systems, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be differentiated into retinal organoids (ROs). These organoids broadly mimic in vivo retinogenesis and retinal morphology, with appropriate apical-basal polarity and time-dependent self-patterning of major cell types into a laminated structure [ - ]. Subsequent improvements of differentiation protocols generated ROs with rudimentary outer segment-like structures and light responses, suggesting at least partially functional maturation of photoreceptors in culture [ - ]. \n\nROs carrying retinal disease-causing mutations could potentially recapitulate disease progression in vitro and facilitate the development of effective treatments [ ]. However, despite initial successful attempts at modeling inherited retinal dystrophies [ - ], the high degree of complexity and relatively low yield in current protocols remain significant technical challenges, particularly for inexperienced personnel. Currently widely used differentiation protocols require labor-intensive and time-consuming dissection of optic vesicle (OV)-like domains after such structures have emerged in adherent cultures [ , , ], thus hindering applications that require large-scale production of ROs, such as biochemical studies and high-throughput drug screening. Furthermore, the efficiency of this step can drastically vary depending on dissection skills and the ability to correctly identify prospective OV domains, which are not always morphologically well defined in adherent cultures. In addition, organoids generated from dissection often lack RPE domains, which are normally concomitantly generated, positionally contiguous with the neural retina (NR), and play an important role in retinal differentiation and photoreceptor maintenance [ ]. \n\nWe report a significant yet simple modification of the conventional methods for generating retinal organoids from pluripotent stem cells, which is more efficient, robust, and convenient. In lieu of dissecting out prospective OV domains, the adherent culture is scraped off entirely and cultured in a free-floating condition. OVs with classical appearance and clear lamination emerged within 1 day. The OVs are easy to identify and require little effort in harvesting. We evaluated this method using one human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line and five human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines and obtained up to a fivefold higher yield of ROs. These organoids are more consistently associated with an RPE-like domain, and thus, better mimic human retina morphogenesis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Generation and maintenance of hPSCs \n  \nThe CRX-GFP hESC line (a derivative of H9) was generated and characterized as described in our previous publication [ ]. The hiPSC lines PEN8E, 901, 902, 1C, and 2D were reprogrammed from skin biopsies using integration-free Sendai virus carrying the four Yamanaka factors, as previously described [ ]. Characterization of PEN8E, 1C, and 2D has been reported [ ]. Pluripotency of 901 and 902 was confirmed with immunostaining of multiple pluripotency markers SSEA4, OCT4, TRA-1-60, and NANOG (data not shown). All hPSC lines were maintained in growth factor-reduced (GFR) or hESC-qualified Matrigel (Corning, NY)-coated plates using either Essential 8 (E8; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada). hPSCs were passaged at 60% to 80% confluency using the EDTA-based protocol. \n\n\n### Embryoid body formation and OV induction in adherent cultures \n  \nhPSCs were induced to form OVs as previously described [ , ]. Briefly, to start differentiation, hPSCs from one well of a six-well plate were dissociated into small clumps using 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA/PBS (1X, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH PO , 137.9 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na HPO -7H O, pH 7.4; Corning, NY), resuspended in either E8 or mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10\u00a0\u00b5M Y-27632 (Tocris, Bristol, UK), and transferred into one 100\u2010mm polyHEMA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)-coated Petri dish for embryoid body (EB) formation. Neural induction medium (NIM) composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F-12 (1:1; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1X MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAAs; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml heparin (Sigma) was supplied to the culture at a ratio of 3:1 and 1:1 at differentiation day (D) 1 and 2, respectively. At D3, the media were switched to 100% NIM. EBs from one 100-mm Petri dish were plated onto a 60-mm Petri dish coated with BD GFR Matrigel at D7 and cultured in NIM for 9 additional days, with the media changed every 2\u20133 days. At D16, the media were completely switched to 3:1 retinal induction medium (3:1 RIM) composed of DMEM/F-12 (3:1) supplemented with 2% B  supplement without vitamin A (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1% GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific), and 1X NEAA (Sigma). The media were changed every 2\u20133 days until OV-like structures appeared, which usually emerged between D20 and D30 ( ). \n  \nDescription of the scraping protocol for differentiating retinal organoids.   A  : Schematic representation of the scraping differentiation protocol used in this study. hPSCs: human pluripotent stem cells; EBs: embryoid bodies; ROs: retinal organoids; NIM: neural induction medium; RIM: retinal induction medium; IGF1: insulin-like growth factor 1.

C  : Representative bright-field images of differentiating ROs 10 days after scraping from hESC line H9 and hiPSC lines 1C, 2D, 8E, 901, and 902. White asterisks: optic vesicle-like structures; white arrowheads: neural retina; black arrowheads: pigmented epithelium domains; black arrow: presumptive photoreceptor cilia. \n  \n\n### Generation and maintenance of ROs \n  \nAdherent cells from one 60-mm Petri dish were scraped off using a cell scraper (Corning, NY) into small clumps (<5\u00a0mm ) between D20 and D30. The resulting clumps were transferred to two polyHEMA-coated 100-mm Petri dishes and maintained in free-floating cultures in 3:1 RIM supplemented with 20 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; ThermoFisher Scientific). A full media change was performed the next day. Well-formed singlet or doublet optic vesicles can be harvested with a wide-bore pipette. Bunched optic vesicles in a large mass were dissected with a pair of 30 gauge/0.5 inch hypodermic needles fitted to 1\u00a0ml syringes using a scissoring motion under a stereomicroscope and transferred to polyHEMA-coated culture dishes. \n\nStarting from D35, 3:1 RIM was supplemented with 20 ng/ml IGF-1, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ThermoFisher Scientific), and 1\u00a0mM Taurine (Sigma). From D63 onward, 3:1 RIM was supplemented with 1\u00a0\u03bcM 9-  cis   retinal, which subsequently decreased to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM starting from D91. From D91 until the end of differentiation, 1% N2 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used instead of B27 supplement without vitamin A. The media were half-changed every 2\u20133 days until D200, with 9-  cis   retinal and IGF-1 freshly added to the media under dim light environment. \n\n\n### Immunofluorescence \n  \nhPSC-derived ROs were collected at different time points and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (FD NeuroTechnologies, Columbia, MD) for 1 h at room temperature. ROs were then cryoprotected using a sucrose gradient (15\u201330%) and embedded in M1 embedding matrix (Thermo Scientific) before sectioning. Ten-micron sections were obtained using Leica Biosystems Cryostat (Buffalo Grove, IL) at \u221214\u00a0\u00b0C. Sections were dried on Superfrost Plus Microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) and stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C until use. For immunostaining, after 30-min incubation in blocking solution (PBS with 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton) at room temperature, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C (antibody information and dilution are listed in Appendix 1). After three 10-min washes in PBS, appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added for 1\u2009h at room temperature. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and analysis \n  \nFor bright-field images, samples were visualized and imaged using an EVOS XL Core Cell Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific). Fluorescence images were acquired with an LSM-700 or LSM-880 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with Zen software. Images were exported, analyzed, and processed with Fiji and Photoshop CC 2019 software. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe number of ROs (with or without RPE domains) in three independent differentiation batches were quantified based on morphological criteria (presence of a phase-bright neuroepithelial outer rim for the NR and the presence of pigmentation for RPE cells). Comparisons between the dissection and scraping methods were performed using the unpaired   t   test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The scraping method for generating ROs \n  \nRetinal differentiation was initiated as previously described [ , ], by aggregating dissociated hPSCs to form EBs and plating them on Matrigel-coated dishes to induce the formation of OV-like domains ( ). At approximately D20 (counting the first day of EB formation as D0), adherent cells were completely lifted using a cell scraper and dispersed into small pieces and clumps, which were then cultured in free-floating conditions. As short as 24 h after scraping, we consistently observed efficient formation of a high number of ROs in six different hPSC lines, as shown by a phase-bright neuroepithelial outer rim ( ). Depending on the clump size after scraping, formation of individual ROs ( , upper row) or bunched ROs ( , lower row) was observed. In both cases, ROs were able to differentiate comparably in size and morphology, suggesting that the surrounding tissues in bunched structures did not impair RO growth and differentiation. Given that smaller clumps (<5\u00a0mm ) yielded mostly singlet or doublet OVs that can be cultured to maturity with no need for dissection, they are preferred over the larger bunched ones. \n\n\n### NR in ROs generated by the scraping method \n  \nTo compare RO production efficiency between the dissection and scraping methods, we quantified the number of ROs generated by both methods at D60\u2013120 using four different cell lines ( ). Despite variation between cell lines in differentiation efficiency [ ], a significant (2.5- to 4.6-fold) increase in RO production was reproducibly obtained by the scraping method compared to dissection. Notably, we were able to obtain OVs by lifting areas \u201cdepleted\u201d of OV-like domains after dissection by experienced operators (data not shown), providing a potential explanation for the better yield of the scraping method. \n  \nThe scraping method improves the yield of ROs with morphology similar to those obtained with dissection.   A  : Quantification of the number of retinal organoids (ROs) produced by the scraping and dissection methods, using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) from one well of a six-well plate. The bar charts summarized data from three independent experiments using four different hPSC lines and presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. *p<0.05; n.s., non-significant.   B  : Immunohistochemistry analysis of H9 human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived ROs using antibodies against markers for retinal ganglion cells (BRN3A, green), horizonal or amacrine cells (CALB, red), photoreceptor progenitor cells (RCVRN, red), M\u00fcller glia (CRALBP, green), retinal progenitor cells or bipolar cells (CHX10, green), rod bipolar cells (PKC\u03b1, red) and photoreceptors (RHO, green), S-cones (OPN1SW, yellow), and L/M-cones (OPNL/MW, red).   C  : Ciliary markers showing the basal bodies (PCTN, red, left panel) and the cilia (ARL13B, green, right panel) of photoreceptors. Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Arrowheads indicate relevant staining of each marker. \n  \nWe then assessed whether the ROs produced using the scraping method differentiated in a comparable manner with the dissected ones, by evaluating the biogenesis of major retinal cell types using immunohistochemistry ( ). Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and horizontal cells are the two earliest-born cell types in the human retina. As early as D60, an abundance of RGCs (BRN3A positive) was evident in the innermost layer of the dissected and scraped ROs. However, few BRN3A-positive cells were observed at D200 in ROs generated by both methods, which is consistent with previous studies [ ]. Horizontal or amacrine cells (CALB positive) were observed at D60 and D200, regardless of the method used. In ROs obtained with both methods, retinal progenitor marker CHX10 initially expanded to the whole neuroblastic layer at D60 and was subsequently restricted to bipolar cells in the inner nuclear layer at D200, mimicking the in vivo expression pattern. Rod bipolar cells were also shown by PKC\u03b1 staining in both conditions. Consistent with in vivo retinal development, late-born M\u00fcller glial cells were not detected at D60, as shown by the absence of CRALBP staining, but were found expanding in the inner nuclear layers and forming the outer limiting membrane at D200, as the ROs became more mature. Finally, no significant differences were found in photoreceptor development between the dissected and scraped ROs. Regardless of the method used, relatively weak expression of photoreceptor progenitor cell marker RCVRN was observed at D60, suggesting the start of photoreceptor cell fate specification. The robust RCVRN staining at D200, together with the development of outer segment-like structures shown by the staining of rhodopsin and cone opsins (L/M- and S-opsin), indicate the partial maturation of rod and cone photoreceptors in ROs generated by both methods. As shown by ciliary marker ARL13B and basal body marker PCNT, photoreceptor cilia and basal bodies at D200 were correctly aligned at the apical side of the retinal organoids ( ). Taken together, these results confirmed that ROs obtained with the scraping method displayed similar morphology to those obtained with dissection and recapitulated the temporal development of major retinal cell types in vivo. \n\n\n### Cogeneration of pigment epithelium and NR domains \n  \nAdditionally, we noted a higher proportion of ROs associated with one or more pigmented domains using the scraping method compared to the dissection. For the four cell lines evaluated, a significantly higher proportion of organoids were found to contain pigmented cells using the scraping method (22.3% to 35.1% by dissection versus 77.2% to 82.6% by scraping,  ). We then examined the identity of these pigmented cells by assessing the expression of RPE-specific markers with immunostaining ( ). As expected, cells localized in pigmented domains formed a monolayered epithelium and expressed the pigmentation marker MITF and PMEL17. Moreover, these cells expressed, specifically at their apical membrane, the microvilli-associated proteins EZRIN and MERTK. The latter is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in phagocytosis of the shed outer segment, confirming their RPE identity and at least partial maturation of these cells as early as D60. In contrast, pigmented domains were less frequently detected in dissected ROs. We also noticed the presence of a distinct subgroup of cells, at the junction between the RPE and NR domains, that coexpressed the ciliary epithelium marker AQP-1 and CHX10 but not the RPE marker MITF. This could indicate the presence of a ciliary margin zone as previously described in human ROs [ ] ( ). \n  \nCogeneration of the neural retina and pigmented epithelium is enhanced by the scraping differentiation method.

The bar charts summarized data from three independent experiments using four different human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines and presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. *p<0.05.

Arrowheads indicate relevant staining of each marker. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe described a modified differentiation protocol for efficient production of ROs from hPSCs. Replacement of the dissection step with a simpler and less labor-intensive scraping method not only saves time but also increases the yield of RO production by up to about fivefold. Moreover, as the whole adherent culture is scraped off, this method circumvents subjective selection of OVs-like domains which, when adherent to plastic dishes, do not always display a readily identifiable morphology. These features make the new method far more robust and accessible to inexperienced personnel. With this new method, we consistently obtained ROs from cultures depleted of all apparent OVs-like domains by dissection, which indicates that organoids emerged from areas without typical morphology and explains the higher yield of the scraping method. Whether these ROs emerged from specified retinal progenitors that failed to form typical OV-like structures in adherent culture conditions, or from less mature eye field progenitors whose differentiation could be stimulated by the 2D to 3D transition remains to be determined. Regardless, this observation suggests the prevalence of latent OVs or eye field cells that are constrained in adherent cultures but are released from such inhibition upon transitioning to 3D conditions. This idea can be best understood in the context of matrix stiffness and mechanical forces having a profound influence on stem cell development [ ]. OVs in vivo evaginate from the anterior neural plate where tissue stiffness is measured in dozens of Pascals in contrast to the standard in vitro culture dish measured in millions of Pascals, differing in stiffness by orders of magnitude. The hypothesis that a softer matrix environment favors eye field specification and OV generation remains to be validated experimentally. \n\nWe have shown that organoids obtained with this new scraping method displayed morphology similar to that of the dissected organoids and recapitulated the temporal development of the in vivo retina [ ], with initial biogenesis of early-born retinal cell types, such as RGCs and horizontal cells, followed by specification of bipolar and M\u00fcller cells concomitantly with photoreceptor maturation. Importantly, no differentiation delay or increased variability among organoids was observed using the scraping method. Recent studies indicated that the proportion of cone and rod photoreceptors in ROs could be modified by modulation of key signaling pathways, such as DHA and FGF1 [ ], Notch [ ], retinoic acid [ ], IGF-1 [ ], and thyroid hormone [ , ]. Such modifications could be implemented in the new scraping method for applications requiring enrichment of a specific cell type. \n\nAnother interesting observation in this study was more frequent cogeneration of the NR and RPE using the scraping protocol. One possible explanation is that ROs are able to retain surrounding tissues by scraping, leading to the conservation of RPE precursors that may be removed by dissection. As shown in a previous study, RPE spheroids consistently emerge from the remaining adherent cells after dissection of OVs [ ]. Despite the high proportion of ROs associated with RPE domains, however, we never detected direct apposition of RPE and NR as is observed in the in vivo retina after optic cup invagination, an observation consistent with previous reports [ , ]. Nevertheless, we noted the presence of a distinct pool of cells at the NR and RPE junction(s), with the expression of ciliary epithelium marker AQP1 but not RPE marker MITF. This pool of cells could represent the ciliary margin stem cells described in a previous study [ ], in which a complex \u201cinduction-reversal method\u201d was used to manipulate cell fate specification and promote cogeneration of the RPE and NR. However, although the method presented here is simpler, additional investigations are required to confirm \u201cstemness\u201d and the proliferative capacity of this particular domain. \n\nDespite the improved yields, photoreceptors in the organoid cultures in this study still lacked outer segment structures with well-stacked discs. Comparative transcriptome analyses of human adult retina and hPSC-derived organoids revealed downregulation of many phototransduction genes in cultures [ ], suggesting that retinal organoids are not yet functionally mature. Given the crucial role of RPE in photoreceptor outer segment homeostasis [ ], it has long been postulated that coculture of ROs in direct apposition with RPE could improve photoreceptor maturation. The recently reported retina-on-a-chip model, which incorporates the coculture of RPE and ROs in a microfluidic system, enhanced the formation of outer segment\u2013like structures [ ], although the photoreceptor outer segments in these organoids still lacked organized discs. An alternative approach used decellularized extracellular matrix\u2013derived peptides from the bovine NR and RPE, which may enhance synaptogenesis and light responsiveness of human ROs [ ]. Improvement of oxygenation and material exchanges, by culturing organoids in a rotating bioreactor, also increased the yield of photoreceptors [ , ], suggesting a crucial role of the microenvironment in organoid differentiation. Additional investigations are necessary to identify and incorporate additional missing factors for photoreceptor maturation in vitro. \n\nTo conclude, by increasing the yield while decreasing the complexity of RO production, the method described in this study should facilitate the development of applications requiring large-scale generation of ROs, such as high-throughput drug screening, and benefit less experienced researchers in their quest for a simple and reliable method for generating ROs. Consequently, this method presents a valuable in vitro platform for understanding retinal development and evaluating effective treatments for diseases. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7051860, "text_md5": "091104072e0859a52f4fc5d4cc47b5ee", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 112], "publication_year": [114, 118], "title": [129, 197], "keywords": [211, 211], "abstract": [224, 1689], "body": [1698, 24768]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32174751, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7051860", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7051860"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7051860\">7051860</a>", "list_title": "PMC7051860  A simple and efficient method for generating human retinal organoids"}

Because neutrophils are implicated in atherosclerosis development, this study reports that the interaction among low-density granulocytes, a subset of neutrophils, and platelets is associated with a noncalcified coronary plaque burden assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography. Because early atherosclerotic noncalcified burden can lead to fatal myocardial infarction, the low-density granulocyte\u2212platelet interaction may play a crucial target for clinical intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \nPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated skin disease that affects 2% to 3% of the adult U.S. population  ,  ,  . Psoriasis is associated with detrimental effects beyond the skin; it significantly reduces the quality of life through emotional and physical complications  . Most concerning, multiple studies have demonstrated that psoriasis patients have increased susceptibility to early-onset atherosclerosis and its ensuing complications, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular mortality beyond traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors  ,  ,  ,  . CVD is the leading cause of mortality in psoriasis, especially in patients with severe psoriasis  ,  . \n\nThe immune response plays a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis, with neutrophils playing an important role in plaque progression  ,  ,  . Circulating neutrophil frequency is reported to\u00a0be a potential biomarker of CVD  , and in inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, neutrophils are associated with accelerated atherogenesis  ,  ,  . Circulating neutrophils in psoriasis exhibit an activated phenotype, and the inflammatory neutrophil protein calprotectin (S100A8/A9) is elevated in psoriasis  . Moreover, S100A8/A9 is\u00a0related to vascular disease. Neutrophils are the foremost immune cells to infiltrate the papillary layer and subepidermal zone of the skin before psoriatic lesion formation, which suggests they may be a potential link between early-onset CVD and psoriasis  . The distinct subset of neutrophils termed low-density granulocytes (LDGs) are of particular interest. LDGs are neutrophils purified from the less dense peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction after density gradient centrifugation  ,  ,   and are associated with CVD in chronic inflammatory disease states  ,  . LDGs have an enhanced capacity to spontaneously form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a cell death process termed NETosis, which is characterized by the extracellular release of chromatin material bound to proteins present in neutrophil granules  ,  ,  . However, the stimulus that activates the spontaneous NETosis mechanism in LDGs in inflammatory diseases remains unclear. \n\nActivated platelets have been described to play a role among the various stimuli known to induce NETs  ,  ,  . Platelet activation characterized by the expression of platelet activation molecules (e.g.,\u00a0CD36) is associated with atherosclerosis and other inflammatory conditions  ,  . Although platelets are involved in NET formation, only a few\u00a0studies have investigated this in nonchronic inflammatory states  ,  . Furthermore, when spontaneous NETosis occurred at a higher frequency in a small preliminary study, it was not studied, but the reason may be related, in part, to unexplored neutrophil\u2212platelet interactions  . \n\nIn the present study, we aimed to characterized LDGs and normal-density granulocytes (NDGs) in psoriasis. Our goal was to understand the potential relationship between neutrophil subsets and the presence of early coronary artery disease in humans with psoriasis. We hypothesized that LDGs would be associated with psoriasis skin disease severity and early noncalcified coronary plaque burden (NCB) as assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Subsequently, we identified the interaction between LDGs and platelets as a prospective mechanism that stimulated increased LDG NETosis, which resulted in endothelial damage. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study population \n  \nStudy approval for the cohort study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in accordance with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki. This study reported the baseline visits of patients recruited longitudinally and consecutively into 2 ongoing protocols from January 2013 to May 2017 ( ). To be included in the study, psoriasis patients were required to have a formal diagnosis of psoriasis confirmed by a health care provider. All patients underwent CCTA to assess coronary plaque burdens, as described previously  . Psoriasis skin disease severity was assessed with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and was measured as published  . The PASI score combines the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score, considering erythema, induration, and desquamation within each lesion. A combination of isolation and flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of LDGs and NDGs for each patient. Exclusion criteria for healthy control subjects included a history of systemic inflammatory or vascular disease, active infectious disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and overweight to obese individuals (body mass index >30 kg/m ). In total, 81 psoriasis patients and 36 healthy control subjects were enrolled with comprehensive CCTA data ( ). Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were followed for reporting the findings of our observational study  . \n\n\n### Acquisition of CCTA \n  \nAll patients underwent CCTA on the same day as the blood draw, using the same computed tomography scanner (320-detector row Aquilion ONE ViSION, Toshiba, Japan). \n\n\n### Analysis of CCTA \n  \nA single, blinded reader (blinded to treatment and time of scan) evaluated coronary plaque characteristics across each of the main coronary arteries at >2 mm using dedicated software (QAngio CT, Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands)  ,  . Results of the automated contouring were also reviewed on transverse reconstructed cross sections of the artery on a section-by-section basis at 0.5-mm increments. Lumen attenuation was adaptively corrected on an individual scan basis using gradient filters and intensity values within the artery. \n\n\n### Laboratory procedures \n  \nFor detailed methods see the   section. \n\n\n### Whole blood processing and immunophenotyping \n  \nBriefly, lysed whole blood cells or ficoll-separated PBMCs were incubated for 30 min in a 10-color antibody cocktail ( ) and acquired on a BD Biosciences LSRII flow cytometer using DIVA 6.1.2 software (BD Bioscience, San Jose, California). We determined the frequency of LDGs by quantitating the percentage of CD14 CD15 CD10  cells in the PBMC fraction by flow cytometry and used the complete blood count to determine the frequency of LDGs per microliter. \n\n\n### RNA sequencing analysis \n  \nPaired NDGs or LDGs (n\u00a0= 50,000) were isolated from 7 psoriasis patients. We performed quantile normalization and used limma   for differential expression analysis to identify genes that were dysregulated between the NDG and LDG subsets, controlling for the individual and batch effects. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for multiple testing, and significant differentially expressed genes had a FDR\u00a0\u22640.1 and |log2(fold change)|\u00a0\u2265 1.5. We then identified functions or gene ontologies that were enriched among differentially expressed genes, and FDR\u00a0\u22640.1 was used to declare significance. All graphical illustrations and RNA-seq analyses were conducted using custom scripts and libraries implemented in R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nSummary statistics were presented as mean \u00b1 SD for normally distributed variables, medians and interquartile range were used for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and frequencies were used for categorical variables. Normality was assessed by skewness and kurtosis. Parametric variables were compared between groups using Student\u2019s   t  -test, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was performed for nonparametric variables. Dichotomous variable comparisons were done using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test. Unadjusted regression analyses were performed to evaluate for potential relationships between LDG frequency and coronary plaque burden, and regression results were represented as standardized beta-coefficients with p\u00a0values. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses to evaluate the association of coronary plaque burden with LDG and NDG frequency. These analyses were adjusted for traditional CVD risk as assessed by the Framingham 10-year risk, body mass index, type 2 diabetes, treatment with statins, and treatment with systemics. Results were presented with 95% confidence intervals, where applicable, and p values\u00a0<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical characteristics of study participants \n  \nWe summarized the characteristics of our study population in  . The study cohort consisted of 81 consecutively recruited psoriasis patients and 36 healthy control subjects for LDG and NDG frequency comparisons ( ,  ). The psoriasis cohort was middle aged (49.1 \u00b1 12.9 years), with a slight male predominance (64%), and a low CV risk as assessed by Framingham 10-year risk (median: 2; interquartile range: 1 to 4). The median PASI score was 7.4 (interquartile range: 3.4 to 11.8), which was consistent with moderate psoriasis skin disease severity ( ).   \nBaseline Characteristics of Psoriasis Patients and Healthy Control Subjects \n          \n\n\n### Circulating LDG counts in psoriasis are associated with psoriasis skin disease severity \n  \nBoth LDG and NDG subsets were elevated in psoriasis patients compared with healthy control subjects (1.3- and 2.0-fold, respectively) ( ). The frequency of circulating LDGs was associated with psoriasis severity (PASI: \u03b2\u00a0= 0.28; p\u00a0= 0.01), which remained significant after adjustment for body mass index, psoriasis treatment, and absolute neutrophil count (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.26; p\u00a0= 0.03) ( ). However, an association between NDG frequency and psoriasis skin disease severity was not detected (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.006; p\u00a0= 0.92) ( ). We then compared the surface markers of LDGs and NDGs in psoriasis to LDGs and NDGs from healthy control subjects ( ) and observed a significant elevation in CD15 in healthy control and psoriasis LDGs compared with both healthy control and psoriasis NDGs. This was concomitant with a reduction in CD11b on psoriasis LDGs and NDGs compared with healthy control NDGs ( ). CD62L was significantly downregulated on psoriasis LDGs compared with both psoriasis and healthy control NDGs ( ). Increased shedding of CD62L might indicate that psoriasis LDGs were in a higher state of activation compared with NDGs. No change in the surface expression of CD15, CD16, CD11b, or CD62L was observed when comparing LDGs from psoriasis patients with LDGs from healthy control subjects ( ).   \nLDGs Are Elevated in Psoriasis Patients and Are Associated With Psoriasis Severity \n\n (A)   Normal-density granulocyte (NDG) and low-density granulocyte (LDG) frequencies were determined by flow cytometry and are elevated in psoriasis patients (n\u00a0=\u00a081) compared with healthy control subjects (n\u00a0= 36). Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The Mann-Whitney test was performed, and significance was set at *p\u00a0< 0.05* and ***p\u00a0< 0.001. Regression analyses between   (B)   LDGs but not   (C)   NDGs are associated with the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score for the psoriasis cohort (n\u00a0= 81).   (D)   Surface marker expression of NDGs and LDGs was analyzed by flow cytometry and   (E)   showed a significant elevation in CD15 on psoriasis LDGs compared with healthy control and psoriasis NDGs, as well as lower CD11b and CD62L expression on psoriasis LDGs compared with healthy control LDGs. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Significance was established by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test set at *p\u00a0< 0.05, ****p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, and ****p\u00a0< 0.0001. MFI\u00a0= median fluorescence intensity. \n  \n\n\n### NCB in psoriasis associates with LDG counts \n  \nEvidence of early coronary atherosclerosis in psoriasis patients is driven by an increase in NCB ( ). Moreover, total coronary plaque burden (TB) and NCB within 3 major epicardial coronary arteries were positively associated with LDG frequency (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.18; p\u00a0= 0.005), which persisted beyond adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors and lipid treatment (TB: \u03b2\u00a0= 0.13; p\u00a0= 0.026) (NCB: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.13; p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) ( ). Furthermore, no association was observed between NDG frequency and TB, as well as NCB, even when adjusted for traditional risk factors (TB: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.003; p\u00a0= 0.98; NCB: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.03; p\u00a0= 0.76) ( ).   \nLDGs and Their NETs Induce Endothelial Cell Damage \n\n (A)   Psoriasis LDGs but not   (B)   psoriasis NDGs are associated with noncalcified coronary plaque burden (NCB) in psoriasis (n\u00a0= 81).   (C)   Representative flow cytometry plots from the cytotoxicity assay show   (D)   psoriasis LDGs (n\u00a0= 7) increase apoptosis of human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs) compared with psoriasis NDGs (n\u00a0= 5), an effect abrogated by DNase treatment (n\u00a0= 4).

To normalize activation between LDGs and NDGs from psoriasis due to the isolation process, we sorted both LDGs and NDGs following an identical gating strategy ( ). We then measured the cytotoxic potential of psoriasis LDGs compared with psoriasis NDGs by quantifying the percentage of apoptotic CD146  HAoECs via flow cytometry in a co-culture system ( ). LDGs (2:1, LDGs-to-HAoECs) led to an increase in the percentage of apoptotic HAoECs by 1.6-fold compared with the same number of NDGs ( ). To further support our hypothesis that HAoEC death might have been due be to LDG-derived NET formation, HAoECs were simultaneously treated with DNase and LDGs. DNase-treated co-cultures led to a 1.5-fold decrease in the percentage of HAoEC deaths comparable with NDGs, which resulted in increased HAoECs in the early apoptotic stage compared with LDGs alone ( ). To further mimic the psoriasis-like inflammatory state, HAoECs were pre-treated with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3, followed by psoriasis LDGs or NDGs  . LDGs further increased the percentage of HAoEC death upon activation ( ). \n\nWe next measured the cytotoxic potential of NETs harvested from psoriasis LDGs and NDGs, which contain NET-associated proteins and fragmented DNA, on HAoECs. Upon treatment of HAoECs with LDG or NDG NETs, normalized to 50 \u03bcg of either LDG or NDG NET-associated proteins, we determined that HAoECs treated with LDG NETs showed a 32% reduction in live HAoECs concomitant with a 1.4-fold increase in early apoptotic cells compared with NDG NET-associated proteins ( ). No difference was detected in the percentage of dead HAoECs subsequent to LDG and NDG NET treatments ( ). This suggested that the mechanism by which LDGs exerted cytotoxic effects might, in part, rely on the cellular interaction between LDGs and HAoECs or intact DNA. To visualize the NETosis process between psoriasis LDGs and NDGs, we acquired scanning electron microscopy images of NET formation over time. Nonstimulated LDGs formed NETs by the 2-h timepoint compared with psoriasis NDGs stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is an inducer of NETosis. NETs were not observed until 4 h ( ). We observed the\u00a0initial stages of NETosis, characterized by rounding and flattening at 30 min for LDGs and 2 h for NDGs  . \n\n\n### RNA sequencing of LDGs compared with NDGs reveals upregulation of granule proteins and adhesion molecules \n  \nTo understand the relationship between psoriasis LDGs and NCB, which is a relationship not observed with psoriasis NDGs, we studied RNA expression between these neutrophil subsets derived from 7 patients with active psoriasis. By comparing the transcriptomes between LDGs and\u00a0NDGs, we determined that 1,076 ( ) were differentially expressed ( ). The volcano plots showed a separation of genes corresponding to NDGs relative to LDGs ( ). Functional analyses revealed that gene pathways that were differentially expressed between LDGs and NDGs were clustered in leukocyte activation (p\u00a0= 1\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 10 ) and cell activation (p\u00a0= 2\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 4\u00a0\u00d7 10 ) ( ). In addition, the granule proteins were upregulated at the gene level in LDGs ( ), which is a mechanism that typically stops before release from the bone marrow  . Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed this finding, demonstrating LDGs had more electron-dense granules that corresponded with primary granules ( )  . Concomitant with increased granule proteins, we observed that the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-2, integrin subunit alpha M (ITGAM), and integrin alpha subunit L\u00a0(ITGAL) were upregulated in LDGs ( ).   \nGranule Proteins and Adhesion Molecules Are Upregulated in LDGs Compared With NDGs at the Gene Level \n\nRNA sequencing analysis was completed on 50,000 LDGs relative to NDGs from psoriasis patients.   (A)   Differentially expressed genes (n\u00a0= 1,076) were identified between NDGs and LDGs from psoriasis patients (n\u00a0= 7). NDGs are the reference, as are upregulated genes in LDGs.   (B)   The volcano plot shows clear separation between NDGs and LDGs. The upregulated   (red)   and downregulated   (green)   transcriptomes are NDGs, as LDGs are the reference sample.   (C)   The gene ontology biological process analysis highlighted biological processes that were differentially expressed between NDGs and LDGs. Significance was established by false discovery rate (FDR).   (D)   Granule proteins are upregulated in all patients (n\u00a0= 7) and when normalized and by   (E)   FPKM values (n\u00a0= 7). Data are represented as means \u00b1 SEM. Significance was established by the unpaired Mann-Whitney Student\u2019s   t  -test and set at *p\u00a0< 0.05.

Therefore, we investigated the relationship of platelets and LDGs as a potential link to the positive association between LDGs and NCB. From the transcriptome data, we observed a clear upregulation of platelet-specific biological processes in the LDG sample, clustered in pathways that included platelet\u00a0alpha granules (p\u00a0= 4\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 2\u00a0\u00d7 10 ), platelet activation (p\u00a0= 2\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 10 ), platelet\u00a0alpha granule lumen (p\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 6\u00a0\u00d7 10 ), platelet activation signaling and aggregation (p\u00a0= 4\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 7\u00a0\u00d7 10 ), and platelet degranulation (p\u00a0= 6\u00a0\u00d7 10 ; FDR\u00a0= 9\u00a0\u00d7 10 ) ( ). These were selected pathways because they were not the most significant from the biological pathways list. To understand neutrophil\u2212platelet interactions, we tested the frequency of neutrophil platelet aggregates and found an upregulation of neutrophil platelet aggregates in psoriasis ( ). We then focused on a subset of those genes and determined that CD40 and SELP (platelet-specific receptors that bind to CD40LG and SELPLG on neutrophils), as well as CD40LG and SELPLG were upregulated in LDGs, which suggested increased adhesion between platelets and LDGs ( ). We measured CD36 expression because CD36 promoted thrombosis, and we determined that CD36 expression was upregulated on LDGs compared with NDGs ( ) and were also associated with NCB ( ). After measuring the percentage of LDGs or NDGs that aggregated with platelets in psoriasis using flow cytometry ( ), we determined that the NDG platelet aggregation was highly variable, and there was no difference in the percentage of aggregates compared with LDGs when considering the mean ( ). However, the percentage of LDG platelet aggregates had a positive linear association with NCB, and this association was specific to LDGs ( ). Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed the presence of platelets that adhered to LDGs, a finding that was not observed in the NDG samples ( ).   \nUpregulated Genes in LDGs Show Increased Binding to Platelets \n\nRNA sequencing analysis shows an   (A)   upregulation of platelet-specific biological pathways in psoriasis LDGs versus psoriasis NDGs. Significance was established by FDR.   (B)   Neutrophil platelet aggregates were increased in psoriasis patients (n\u00a0= 12) compared with matched control subjects (n\u00a0= 10).

This finding was similar to the association between LDGs and NCB ( ); however, the association between LDG platelet aggregates and NCB was more robust. Consistent with previous data, this association was attenuated and not significant with the product of NDGs and platelets (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.11; p\u00a0= 0.12) ( ). Lastly, we confirmed that LDGs had increased spontaneous NETosis ( ) and determined that the percentage of LDGs to spontaneously form NETs was associated with the frequency of circulating platelets (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.78; p\u00a0= 0.022) ( ).   \nPercentage of LDGs to Spontaneously Form NETs Is Associated With Circulating Platelet Counts \n\n (A)   The product of platelets and LDGs in circulation is associated with NCB; however,   (B)   this relationship is absent with the product of platelets and NDGs.

(E)   The percentage of LDGs (n\u00a0= 8) to undergo spontaneous NETosis is associated with the frequency of circulating platelets. Abbreviation as in  ,  , and  . \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe demonstrated the following: 1) an increase in LDG frequency was associated with psoriasis severity and TB, specifically NCB, in psoriasis beyond in\u00a0vitro traditional risk factors for CVD; 2) the frequency of NDGs, the dominant neutrophil subset, was not associated with TB or NCB; 3) psoriasis LDGs might exert a cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells compared with NDGs, similar to SLE; and 4) the amount of CD36 gene expression, a platelet gene, in LDGs and the percentage of circulating platelet LDG aggregates were associated with early atherosclerotic NCB. These findings suggested that in an inflammatory environment platelets might potentially interact with LDGs and promote vascular damage. These observations suggested that the adherence of LDG to platelets might be an important link between psoriasis skin disease severity and early atherogenesis, as well as represented a potential target for treatment of both diseases in the future. \n\nNeutrophils are critical to the development of psoriasis, and a reduction in circulating neutrophils is accompanied by regression of psoriatic plaque development  . Our previous study reported an increased circulating frequency of activated neutrophils, as defined by lower CD62L and CD16 surface expression, in psoriasis patients compared with healthy control subjects  . When we focused on biologic-na\u00efve psoriasis patients and the different neutrophil subsets in this study, we determined that CD62L expression on LDGs was significantly lower compared with both healthy control and psoriasis NDGs. We found CD62L expression to be decreased on LDGs compared with NDGs. Although both CD16 and CD62L mark a heightened activation state, only CD62L was reduced on LDGs compared with NDGs in psoriasis. This might, in part, be a result of the formation of LDG platelet aggregates. Neutrophil platelet aggregation in resting neutrophils reduces CD62L expression, and primes neutrophils for adhesion  . This might explain why only the LDGs were associated with psoriasis severity and psoriatic comorbidities. In addition, this positive relationship between LDG frequency and psoriasis severity suggested that LDGs might potentially be a clinical target for treating psoriasis. \n\nNeutrophils are increasingly being recognized as significant contributors to the pathogenesis of CVD. Neutrophil frequency was a predictor of coronary events  , and more recently, this frequency was involved in early atherosclerotic plaque development  . To understand if the development of in\u00a0vivo atherogenesis is related to neutrophils, we leveraged CCTA as a reliable, noninvasive imaging technique to detect atherosclerotic plaque composition in coronary arteries. Comprehensive plaque characterization permitted us to directly assess and correlate TB and NCB with the frequencies of both neutrophil subsets in circulation. Similar to psoriasis severity, we found a positive linear relationship between LDGs and TB in the major coronary arteries, primarily driven by NCB. Furthermore, these activated neutrophils might, in part, be responsible for early damage to both the epidermis and endothelium. \n\nWe hypothesized that early plaque formation evidenced by the increase in NCB in psoriasis was potentially related to the cytotoxic effects of LDGs by 2 factors. First, LDG NETs themselves are more cytotoxic than NDG NETs, and second, LDGs form NETs spontaneously; therefore, the amount of circulating NETs in psoriasis was increased due to increased LDGs. NETs are known to play a role in atherosclerotic plaque development independently of autoimmunity; NETs are released from neutrophils in response to cholesterol-crystal priming, and within the atherosclerotic lesion, NETs are localized to cholesterol-rich areas  . Impairments in DNA clearance by DNase I were described in autoimmunity and might lead to an enhanced half-life of immunogenic material present in NETs, further exacerbating endothelial damage. When endothelial cells were treated with isolated NETs from LDGs or NDGs, we did not observe an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis from LDG NETs. However, the early stage of apoptosis was elevated by LDG-NET treatment compared with NDG NETs, and there was a significant reduction in live HAoECs. Endothelial cell apoptosis required a cell\u2212cell interaction. Notably, DNase I treatment abrogated the cytotoxic effect of LDGs, which suggested that endothelial cell death was not induced by LDGs independent of NET formation. Studies focused on the effects of NETs showed multiple outcomes. At lower concentrations of NETs normalized to DNA content, NETs that contained fragmented DNA were not as potent at activating human pulmonary artery endothelial cells  . However, at significantly higher DNA concentrations, fragmented DNA induced endothelial cell apoptosis to the same extent as intact DNA  . In the present study, the NDG and LDG NETs were composed of NET-associated proteins and fragmented DNA. In addition, we normalized the HAoEC treatments to protein content as opposed to DNA concentrations. This might explain the lack of apoptotic HAoECs subsequent to LDG NET treatment. \n\nTo understand the enhanced cytotoxicity of LDGs compared with NDGs, we completed RNA sequencing of paired LDGs and NDGs derived from biologic-na\u00efve psoriasis patients with severe, active skin disease and identified a potential mechanistic target driving the spontaneous NETosis of LDGs. First, RNA sequencing data showed that LDGs were activated, which was demonstrated by the differential biological pathways corresponding to leukocyte activation, cell activation, regulation of leukocyte activation, positive regulation of cell activation, and regulation of cell activation. These data are in agreement with the decrease in surface expression of CD62L observed on the LDG surface compared with both healthy and psoriasis NDGs. Second, we determined that P-selectin and P-selectin ligand transcriptomes were upregulated in LDGs compared with NDGs. P-selectin is a platelet-specific receptor that is upregulated on activated platelets and binds to the P-selectin ligand on neutrophils. Concomitantly, CD40 and CD40 ligand were upregulated in the LDG sample. This is of interest because activated platelets are reported to induce NET formation from neutrophils in acute lung injury and sepsis  ,  ,  . Furthermore, for the neutrophil inflammatory response to fully ensue, stimulation through the P-selectin ligand is required and drives neutrophil migration  . Blockade of P-selectin ligand signaling altered neutrophil migration and protected mice against thromboinflammatory injury  . Although it was clear that the interaction of platelets and neutrophils through P-selectin and P-selectin ligand is essential, it was shown that high-mobility group box-1 on platelets directs neutrophils to undergo NETosis  . High mobility group box-1 expression increases on the platelet surface upon activation and elicits NET formation through a receptor for advanced glycation end products, a process that is independent of toll-like receptor-4  . \n\nWe determined that the frequency of LDGs co-localized with platelets had a linear association with early NCB. This observation was further strengthened by a significant association between the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads of CD36 in the LDG sample and NCB. The CD36 reads were most likely contributed by platelets co-localized with LDGs because our samples were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry to exclude other cell populations that might express CD36. Combined, our data highlighted a potential role for the LDG\u2212platelet interactions in early atherogenesis. It was possible that the association between the percentage of LDGs to spontaneously form NETs and platelet counts was driven by an increase in activated platelets in psoriasis. Further investigations are required to validate this hypothesis and decipher a biological mechanism by which platelets contribute to NET formation in psoriasis. Recent studies provided insight into which LDGs undergo spontaneous NETosis  ,  . Spontaneous NETosis in isolated SLE LDGs occurs within 50 min. This was reported to occur by a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species\u2212dependent mechanism  . A similar NETosis timeframe was observed when neutrophils were treated with platelet activating factor. Because the adherence of platelets to LDGs might stimulate the release of platelet activating factor, and the NETosis timeframe seen in our studies was similar, we proposed that platelet activating factor was involved in the mechanism of LDG-dependent NETosis. \n\nThis study could be extended to other autoinflammatory pathologies such as SLE. In SLE patients, activated platelets enhance the interferon response, and platelet depletion in an SLE murine model significantly improved disease measures and survival  . \n\n### Study limitations \n  \nThere were important limitations to our study. This was an observational study; therefore, it was subjected to potential for confounders and needs experimental follow-up. We also acknowledged that our control group was not adequately matched to our psoriasis group, which was a limitation. Thus, our results should be interpreted with caution. Our plaque characterization and quantification by CCTA was used as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis, although intravascular ultrasound would be the gold standard to prove these findings  . In\u00a0vitro characterization studies are lacking and will be conducted to determine potential drivers of neutrophil platelet aggregation. The RNA sequencing should be followed up with validation studies of protein content and include control samples to determine if LDGs from healthy control subjects have a similar RNA signature compared with psoriasis LDGs. In addition, future studies using single cell RNA sequencing to better characterize our findings and validation studies should be conducted. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe demonstrated that LDG frequency is elevated in psoriasis and is related to skin disease severity and NCB. Our in\u00a0vitro studies showed that psoriasis LDGs were cytotoxic to the endothelium following direct contact. This study identified the interactions between LDGs and platelets as a mechanistic focus of future studies to determine how spontaneous NETosis of LDGs might be partly dependent upon platelets. Furthermore, this LDG\u2212platelet interaction might provide a potential therapeutic target in the future to reduce atherosclerosis in psoriasis.  \n COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:   Neutrophils have been shown to play an important role in the development early-onset atherogenesis, especially in inflammatory disease states. In addition, a distinct subset of neutrophils termed LDGs are shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease in chronic inflammatory diseases. Finally, the inter-relationship of LDG, platelets, and CCTA-derived early NCB highlights the potential role of LDG\u2212platelet interaction as a driver in chronic inflammatory disease\u2212associated atherosclerosis. \n\n TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1:   Studies in\u00a0vitro should focus on the effect of antiplatelet therapy on neutrophil\u2212platelet aggregate interactions. \n\n TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2:   Studies in\u00a0vivo should deplete platelets in pre-clinical models to understand if neutrophil platelet aggregates and atherosclerosis are reduced. \n \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6390681, "text_md5": "a80245613f159a7fd0a53aea9058aacf", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 683], "journal": [684, 705], "publication_year": [707, 711], "title": [722, 786], "keywords": [800, 1284], "abstract": [1297, 2632], "body": [2641, 38338]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30847414, "doi": "10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.10.008", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6390681", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6390681"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6390681\">6390681</a>", "list_title": "PMC6390681  Neutrophil Subsets, Platelets, and\u00a0Vascular Disease in Psoriasis"}

Recent work found that posttranslational modifications, such as monoubiquitylation, can determine cell fate also independently of effects on transcription, yet how monoubiquitylation is implemented during development is poorly understood. Here, we have identified a regulatory circuit that controls monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification by the E3 ligase CUL3 and its substrate adaptor KBTBD8. We found that CUL3  monoubiquitylates its essential targets only after these have been phosphorylated in multiple motifs by CK2, a kinase whose levels gradually increase during embryogenesis. Its dependency on multisite phosphorylation allows CUL3  to convert the slow rise in embryonic CK2 into decisive recognition of ubiquitylation substrates, which in turn is essential for neural crest specification. We conclude that multisite dependency of an E3 ligase provides a powerful mechanism for switch-like cell fate transitions controlled by monoubiquitylation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMetazoan development relies on accurate cell fate decisions that give rise to the\u00a0~200 cell types of an adult organism. Most differentiation events are switch-like and instruct progenitor cells to decisively adopt a more specialized fate. Epigenetic and transcriptional control have long been known to drive differentiation, and self-reinforcing circuits built around transcription factors or chromatin modifiers help establish the switch-like character of these reactions ( ;  ). Recent work suggested that posttranslational modifications, including monoubiquitylation, guide differentiation events also independently of gene expression, yet the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. \n\nMonoubiquitylation plays a critical role during craniofacial development ( ;  ;  ). This process begins with the emergence of neural crest cells, which originate at the border of the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm and migrate to various target tissues in a developing organism ( ;  ). Upon reaching their destination, neural crest cells differentiate into various derivatives, including chondrocytes, melanocytes, or glial cells. Cranial neural crest cells emerge at the rostral end of the neural tube, migrate to the branchial arches of the developing head, and differentiate into chondrocytes that lay out a collagen matrix for subsequent bone formation. Accordingly, the misregulation of cranial neural crest specification or differentiation results in pathologies that are characterized by the aberrant formation of craniofacial bone ( ). \n\nGeneration of neural crest cells relies on the E3 ligase CUL3 and its substrate adaptor KBTBD8 ( ). CUL3  monoubiquitylates the RNA-binding proteins TCOF1 and NOLC1, which allows these paralogs to associate with each other and recruit enzymes of ribosome biogenesis and modification. The subsequent production of new and possibly modified ribosomes reshapes the mRNA translation landscape of stem cells in favor of neural crest specification ( ). Underscoring the importance of this regulatory circuit for human biology, mutations in   TCOF1   account for\u00a0~90% of cases of the craniofacial disease Treacher Collins Syndrome ( ;  ), while additional transcription factor binding sites in the promoter of   KBTBD8   drive melanoma, a cancer of neural crest origin ( ). At later stages of craniofacial development, CUL3 pairs up with a distinct adaptor, KLHL12, to monoubiquitylate a COPII vesicle coat protein and accelerate collagen secretion ( ;  ), and mutations in this pathway lead to the craniofacial disorder cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia ( ). Together, these findings revealed critical roles of monoubiquitylation in cell differentiation and implied that tight regulation of CUL3 is essential for human development. \n\nDespite its importance for neural crest specification, mechanisms that ensure accurate CUL3  activation and function are very poorly understood. While CUL3  is essential for establishing neural crest cells, it is not required for the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells ( ). This suggested that CUL3  engages its targets at specific stages of differentiation, yet how it recognizes its substrates at the right time and place is not known. How monoubiquitylation by CUL3  helps TCOF1 and NOLC1 bind each other is also unclear: while monoubiquitylation often recruits effector proteins to a modified target ( ;  ), no ubiquitin-binding domains have been identified in TCOF1, NOLC1, or their known binding partners. Indeed, rather than being organized into structural domains that engage in distinct interactions, TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain large stretches of acidic residues that are predicted to be of low structural complexity ( ). How monoubiquitylation of an intrinsically disordered protein can precipitate a switch-like transition in cellular state is an open question. \n\nHere, we show that CUL3 -dependent monoubiquitylation and neural crest specification require multisite substrate phosphorylation by CK2, a kinase whose levels gradually increase during development of the nervous system ( ). The essential CUL3 -substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain 10 or more motifs that, following their phosphorylation by CK2, can be independently recognized by a conserved surface on KBTBD8. We found that multiple CK2 motifs need to be phosphorylated in the same substrate to mediate both monoubiquitylation by CUL3  as well as neural crest specification. Multisite dependency allows cells to convert a gradual increase in kinase input, as seen for embryonic CK2, into decisive activation of signaling output ( ;  ). We therefore propose that multisite dependency of CUL3  provides an elegant mechanism for switch-like cell fate decisions controlled by monoubiquitylation. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### CK2 kinase is required for CUL3 -dependent neural crest specification \n  \nCUL3  drives neural crest specification by catalyzing the monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 ( ), but how it selects its targets at the right time during development is not known. As substrate recognition by cullin-RING ligases often requires posttranslational modifications or co-adaptor proteins ( ;  ), we speculated that regulators of CUL3  could be identified as shared interactors of NOLC1 and TCOF1. We therefore affinity-purified  NOLC1 and  TCOF1 from human 293T embryonic kidney cells, a system that had previously allowed us to discover stem cell-related signaling pathways ( ;  ;  ), and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by CompPASS mass spectrometry ( ;  ). These experiments showed that both NOLC1 and TCOF1 interacted with all subunits of the CK2 kinase ( ), which was consistent with earlier studies that found these proteins to be phosphorylated by CK2 ( ;  ;  ). We confirmed the robust interaction of NOLC1 and TCOF1 with CK2\u03b1 and CK2\u03b2 by affinity-purification and western blotting ( ). \n   CK2 kinase is required for CUL3 -substrate binding and ubiquitylation in cells.  \n(  A  ) Both NOLC1 and TCOF1 associate with the CK2 kinase.  NOLC1 and  TCOF1 were affinity-purified from 293 T cells and specific binding partners were determined by CompPASS mass spectrometry. Total spectral counts (TSCs) of specific interactors were normalized to 1000 TSCs for each bait protein and plotted against each other. For each CUL3 -substrate, three independent affinity-purification and mass spectrometry experiments were performed. The results of each affinity experiments were compared to a database, which included\u00a0~100 unrelated affinity-purifications performed with the same antibody and in the same cell line. (  B  ) TCOF1 and NOLC1 associate with endogenous CK2 in cells.  NOLC1 and  TCOF1 were affinity-purified from 293 T cells, and co-purifying proteins were identified by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. KLHL12  was used as a negative control. The low molecular weight species seen in TCOF1 samples are proteolytic degradation products caused by partial cleavage of the large and intrinsically disordered TCOF1 during the affinity-purification. (  C  ) CK2 is required for substrate recognition by CUL3  in cells. 293 T cells were depleted of CK2\u03b2 using shRNAs and the activity of the remaining CK2 kinase was simultaneously inhibited using the small molecule CX4945. KBTBD8 , the substrate adaptor of CUL3, was affinity-purified and bound endogenous proteins were detected by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. PKN1 is a specific binding partner of KBTBD8 that is not known to be ubiquitylated by CUL3  and that is not important for neural crest specification. (  D  ) CK2 is required for monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 in cells. Ubiquitylated proteins were purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells expressing  ubiquitin. Ubiquitylated proteins were detected by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. PCNA is ubiquitylated by a distinct E3 ligase and hence is used as a control for general ubiquitylation efficiency; unmodified PCNA is not detected in NiNTA pulldowns, demonstrating the specificity of this assay. Input: 3% of lysate used for denaturing purification. (  E  ) CK2 is required for monoubiquitylation of NOLC1 in cells. Ubiquitylated NOLC1 was purified both in the absence or presence of CK2 inhibitors, as described for TCOF1 above. Input: 3% of lysate used for denaturing purification. (  F  ) Inhibition of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases, which counteract CK2 in cells, promotes substrate binding by CUL3 . KBTBD8  or the negative control KLHL12  were affinity-purified from cells treated with the PP1/PP2A-inhibitor okadaic acid. Co-purifying proteins, including endogenous TCOF1, NOLC1, and the control KBTBD8-interactor PKN1, were detected by western blotting. This experiment was performed at smaller scale than  , explaining the lack of TCOF1 binding to KBTBD8 under conditions without phosphatase inhibitors. (  G  ) Inhibition of PP1/PP2A phosphatases increases TCOF1 ubiquitylation in cells. Ubiquitylated  TCOF1 was purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells expressing  ubiquitin and treated with or without okadaic acid. Ubiquitylated proteins were detected by Western blotting. Input: 3% of lysate used for denaturing purification. \n \n   Expression analysis of CK2 and PP1/PP2A in differentiating hESCs.  \n(  A  ) Expression analysis of CK2 and PP1/PP2A subunits in self-renewing hESC and hESCs undergoing neural conversion for the indicated time periods using previously published RNAseq data sets ( ). (  B  ) Expression analysis of CK2 and PP1/PP2A subunits during neural conversion of hESCs by Western blotting using specific antibodies. \n  \n \nExpression of CK2 gradually increases during embryogenesis at times of neural crest development ( ), and CK2 activity had been detected in the branchial arches that are important for craniofacial bone development ( ). Together with our binding studies, these observations suggested that phosphorylation by CK2 might play a role in target recognition and monoubiquitylation by CUL3 . To test this hypothesis, we purified KBTBD8, the subunit of CUL3  that directly binds substrates, from cells that were transfected with shRNAs against CK2\u03b2, that\u00a0is the subunit shared by both CK2a/\u03b2 and CK2\u03b1\u2019/\u03b2 complexes, and treated with a small molecule CK2 inhibitor (CX4945). Such effective inhibition of CK2 prevented NOLC1 or TCOF1 from binding to CUL3 , whereas PKN1, a protein that associates with a different surface of KBTBD8 and is not important for neural crest specification ( ), was still recognized ( ). Inhibition of CK2 also blocked CUL3 -dependent monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1, while the modification of an unrelated protein, PCNA, was not impaired ( ). In line with these results, inactivation of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases, which oppose CK2 in cells ( ), strongly promoted substrate binding and monoubiquitylation by CUL3  ( ). Interestingly, the phosphatase subunit PP1A decreases during neural crest specification in vitro at times when TCOF1 and NOLC1 engage CUL3  ( ). \n\nMonoubiquitylation by CUL3  allows NOLC1 and TCOF1 to bind each other and recruit enzymes required for ribosome biogenesis and neural crest specification ( ). To determine whether CK2 is required for CUL3 -dependent signaling, we therefore asked whether CK2 inhibition impaired formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes. As seen before ( ), we found that the expression of KBTBD8 caused TCOF1 and NOLC1 to associate with each other ( ). Loss of CK2 prevented the CUL3 -dependent assembly of the TCOF1-NOLC1 platform to the same extent as inactivation of KBTBD8 through mutation of its CUL3-binding motif (KBTBD8 ) ( ). Accordingly, depletion of CK2\u03b2 or small molecule inhibition of CK2 kinase activity interfered with neural crest specification ( ). We had previously shown that hESCs that fail to produce neural crest cells induce a compensatory pathway characterized by increased expression of forebrain markers, FOXG1 and SIX3 ( ), and we observed the same response if hESCs were subjected to differentiation in the absence of CK2 ( ). By contrast, low concentrations of the PP1 and PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid increased the efficiency of neural crest specification ( ). We conclude that CK2 is required for the recognition and monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 by CUL3 , formation of a TCOF1-NOLC1 ribosome biogenesis platform, and neural crest specification. \n   CK2 is required for neural crest specification.  \n(  A  ) CK2 is required for CUL3 - and ubiquitylation-dependent formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes.  TCOF1 was affinity-purified from control- or CK2 activity-depleted cells (shCK2\u03b2/CX4945) that expressed WT-KBTBD8 or mutant KBTBD8 , which is unable to bind CUL3 and thus cannot catalyze monoubiquitylation. Bound proteins, including endogenous NOLC1, were detected by western blotting. KLHL12  was used as a control protein. (  B  ) CK2 activity is required for neural crest formation from hESCs. H1 hESCs were subjected to neural conversion in the absence or presence of 1 \u03bcM CK2 inhibitor CX4945. Expression of markers for central nervous system precursor (PAX6) or the neural crest (SOX10) was analyzed by Western blotting. Differentiation was monitored by following the stem cell-specific transcription factor NANOG, using specific antibodies. (  C  ) CK2 controls a switch between CNS and neural crest precursors. Neural conversion of H1 hESCs was induced under control conditions (shControl), in the presence of an shRNA to deplete endogenous CK2\u03b2 (shCK2\u03b2), or in the presence of 1 \u03bcM CK2 inhibitor CX4945 (shControl/CX4549). Differentiation was followed by qRT-PCR analysis of markers of the CNS (SOX2, PAX6, FOXG1, SIX3) or the neural crest (SNAIL2, SOX10, FOXD3, EDNRA, TFAP2). Fold change expression is relative to shControl at day 6 of differentiation. Error bars denote s.e.m. of three technical replicates. (  D  ) CK2 is required for neural crest specification, as detected at the single cell level. H1 hESCs were subjected to neural conversion in the absence of presence of indicated concentrations of CK2 inhibitor CX4945 for 7d. Formation of neural crest cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies specific to SOX10. Representative images are shown. SOX10 positive cells were quantified from three independent experiments and expressed as percentage of total cells imaged. Error bars denote standard deviation. \n \n   Phosphatase inhibition increases the efficiency of neural crest specification.  \nhESCs were subjected to neural conversion in the presence of increasing concentrations of the PP1/PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, and neural crest specification was monitored by following the expression of the neural crest markers SOX10 or SNAIL2 using western blotting. Okadaic acid is toxic to hESCs at concentrations above 1 nM. \n  \n \n\n### A conserved loop in KBTBD8 is required for CK2 substrate recognition \n  \nBy phosphorylating residues embedded in acidic sequences, CK2 generates highly negatively charged proteins ( ;  ). As CK2 appeared to drive target recognition by CUL3 , we expected that a complementary positively charged motif in KBTBD8 might mediate substrate binding. By investigating sequence conservation among 54 vertebrate KBTBD8 homologs, we found a highly conserved positively charged loop that was in proximity of Trp579 ( ;  ), a residue that is known to be required for substrate binding by CUL3  ( ). Replacing five His and Lys residues within this loop with Ala (KBTBD8 ) prevented binding of KBTBD8 to NOLC1 and TCOF1, whereas the interaction of KBTBD8 with CUL3 or PKN1 was not affected by this charge removal ( ). Similar observations were made by affinity-purification coupled to mass spectrometry, where mutation of its positively charged loop blocked KBTBD8-binding to TCOF1 or NOLC1 ( ). \n   A conserved loop in KBTBD8 is required for CK2-substrate recognition.  \n(  A  ) KBTBD8 contains a loop with five His- or Lys-residues that is close to W579, a KBTBD8-residue known to be important for substrate recognition. Depicted is a structural model of the Kelch-domain of KBTBD8; W579 is shown in red, whereas the 5HK-loop is shown in blue. (  B  ) The 5HK-loop in KBTBD8 is required for substrate recognition. KBTBD8  or KBTBD8  (i.e. a KBTBD8-mutant in which all five His- or Lys-residues in the conserved loop were exchanged to Ala) were affinity-purified from cells. Co-purifying TCOF1, NOLC1, or PKN1 were detected by western blotting. (  C  ) The 5HK-loop of KBTBD8 is essential for substrate recognition. The indicated KBTBD8 variants (wt; W579A; 5HK-Ala; F550A; Y74A) were affinity-purified from 293 T cells and analyzed for binding partners by CompPASS mass spectrometry. The heatmap depicts the relative binding of interactors identified for wild-type KBTBD8 in the respective KBTBD8 variant (black\u00a0=\u00a0no interaction, red\u00a0=\u00a0equal or more interaction). A quantification of normalized total spectral counts (TSCs) of three biological replicates is shown for the wild-type KBTBD8 affinity-purification is shown on the left. (  D  ) The 5HK-loop of KBTBD8 is required for TCOF1 ubiquitylation in cells. Ubiquitylated proteins were purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells expressing  ubiquitin. Modified proteins were detected by western blotting, using the indicated antibodies. (  E  ) The 5HK-loop of KBTBD8 is required for NOLC1 ubiquitylation in cells. Ubiquitylated proteins were purified from 293 T cells under denaturing conditions and analyzed as described above. (  F  ) The 5HK loop of KBTBD8 is required for TCOF1-NOLC1 complex formation. Cells expressing  TCOF1 and either KBTBD8 , KBTBD8 , or the control protein KLHL12  were subjected to anti-HA affinity-purification and analyzed for co-purifying proteins by western blotting. ARBB1 and ARBB2 binding to TCOF1 shows that the efficiency of affinity-purification was identical under all conditions. (  G  ) The 5HK loop in KBTBD8 is required for neural crest specification. H1 hESCs were depleted of endogenous KBTBD8 using stably expressed shRNAs. Where indicated, hESCs were reconstituted with shRNA-resistant wild-type (WT) or mutant (5HK) KBTBD8. Differentiation was followed be western blotting using markers of the neural crest (SOX10), CNS precursors (PAX6), or pluripotency (NANOG; OCT4). (  H  ) The 5HK loop of KBTBD8 is required for neural crest specification. H1 hESCs were depleted of KBTBD8 and reconstituted with shRNA-resistant wild-type KBTBD8 or mutant KBTBD8 . Expression of markers of CNS/forebrain (FOXG1, SIX3, PAX6) or the neural crest (SOX10, EDNRA, FOXD3, TFAP2, SNAIL2) was followed by qRT-PCR. Fold change expression is relative to shControl at day 6 of differentiation. Error bars denote s.e.m. of three technical replicates. \n \n   Conservation analysis of KBTBD8.  \nKBTBD8 variants from 54 vertebrate species were subjected to conservation analysis, and conserved residues were mapped onto a structural model of the KELCH-repeats of human KBTBD8. The 5HK loop is highly conserved. \n  \n \nIn line with these results, KBTBD8  was an inactive substrate adaptor that was unable to promote NOLC1 or TCOF1 ubiquitylation in cells ( ) and failed to induce formation of the NOLC1-TCOF1 complex ( ). Moreover, if KBTBD8  was the only KBTBD8 variant expressed in hESCs, cells did not differentiate into neural crest cells and instead showed the compensatory induction of the forebrain markers FOXG1 and SIX3 upon neural conversion ( ). Thus, a positively charged loop in KBTBD8 is required for CUL3  substrate monoubiquitylation and neural crest specification. This strongly suggested that CK2 phosphorylates CUL3 -substrates to mark them for monoubiquitylation. \n\n\n### CK2 is required for NOLC1 and TCOF1 recognition by CUL3 \n  \nTo test the above hypothesis, we purified TCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments that contained two CK2 consensus motifs with several phosphorylation sites each. As evidenced by a CK2- and ATP-dependent increase in molecular weight, these proteins were efficiently phosphorylated by the CK2\u03b1/\u03b2 holoenzyme in vitro ( ). Importantly, when we then incubated purified KBTBD8 with either unmodified or phosphorylated TCOF1 or NOLC1, we found that KBTBD8 selectively bound the phosphorylated, but not unmodified, targets ( ). KBTBD8 did not recognize phosphorylated substrates if its Trp579 or the positively charged 5HK-patch were mutated ( ), and KBTBD8 also did not bind a TCOF1 fragment, whose CK2 motif was destroyed by introduction of positively charged Arg residues or mutation of seven phosphoacceptor Ser residues ( ). By contrast, Phe550 of KBTBD8, which is required for recognition of PKN1 ( ), was not needed for the interaction between phosphorylated TCOF1 or NOLC1 and KBTBD8 ( ). \n   CK2 marks CUL3 -substrates for monoubiquitylation in vitro.  \n(  A  ) TCOF1 and NOLC1 are phosphorylated by recombinant CK2 in vitro. Recombinant Flag-tagged TCOF1  or NOLC1  fragments with two CK2 motifs (Flag-TCOF1*, Flag-NOLC1*) were incubated with either the catalytic subunit CK2\u03b1 or complexes between CK2\u03b1 and the regulatory subunit CK2\u03b2. ATP was added as indicated, and proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. The molecular weight shift observed in the presence of both CK2 and ATP is indicative of phosphorylation. The red asterisk marks CK2\u03b2, as detected at its highest concentration. In the absence of the stabilizing CK2\u03b2-subunit, high concentrations of CK2\u03b1 likely lead to aggregation and reduced TCOF1 phosphorylation. (  B  ) KBTBD8 selectively binds phosphorylated TCOF1. The binding of recombinant Flag-TCOF1* (containing two CK2 motifs) to KBTBD8 was analyzed in the absence or presence of CK2\u03b1/\u03b2. TCOF1 was immobilized on beads and bound KBTBD8 was detected by Coomassie staining. The KBTBD8 variants tested (WT, 5HK, W579A, F550A) are indicated on the right. (  C  ) KBTBD8 selectively binds phosphorylated NOLC1. The binding of recombinant Flag-NOLC1* (containing two CK2 motifs) to KBTBD8 was analyzed as described above for TCOF1. (  D  ) Mutation of a CK2 motif obliterates its recognition by KBTBD8. The indicated CK2 motif of TCOF1  was altered by introduction of one or two Arg residues (sites indicated by red arrows in scheme above) or by mutation of one (S1A), three (S3A) or all seven (S7A) phosphoacceptor Ser residues. Binding to immobilized KBTBD8 was analyzed either in the absence or presence of CK2, using Coomassie staining. (  E  ) KBTBD8 binds a CK2 motif in TCOF1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. A single N-terminally TAMRA-labeled CK2 motif of TCOF1  was either incubated with CK2 (\u2018-PO4\u2019) or kept unmodified and incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant KBTBD8. Binding of KBTBD8 to the CK2 motif was measured as change in fluorescence polarization, and the dissociation constant of the binding reaction was determined by fitting to a two-state binding curve. In addition to wild-type KBTBD8, the ability of a monomeric variant of KBTBD8 (KBTBD8-\u0394dim) was monitored (green curves). In the absence of CK2, no measurable binding was detected (red curves). (  F  ) Mutation of the 5HK loop, but not of W579, obliterates binding of KBTBD8 to a single CK2 motif. Binding of distinct KBTBD8 variants (WT, \u0394dim, W579A, 5HK) to a phosphorylated CK2 motif of TCOF1 was measured by fluorescence polarization. (  G  ) Substrate binding by KBTBD8 is likely electrostatic in nature. Binding of a single phosphorylated CK2 motif from TCOF1 to recombinant KBTBD8 was measured by fluorescence polarization in the presence of increasing concentrations of the highly negatively charged molecule inositolehexakisphosphate (IP6). (  H  ) TCOF1 is monoubiquitylated in vitro. A TCOF1 fragment containing two CK2 motifs (\u2018R1/2\u2019) was first phosphorylated by CK2\u03b1/\u03b2 and then immobilized on FLAG-agarose followed by incubation with KBTBD8; immobilization interfered with non-specific ubiquitylation of the substrate peptide. Next, recombinant neddylated CUL3/Rbx1, E1, UBE2D3, ubiquitin, and ATP were added as indicated, and ubiquitylation of TCOF1 was followed by Western blotting. (  I  ) Monoubiquitylation of TCOF1-R1/2 by CUL3  was analyzed as described above, using the indicated KBTBD8 mutants. \n  \nTitration experiments relying on fluorescence polarization revealed that KBTBD8 bound a single phosphorylated CK2 motif with a K  of\u00a0~1.4 \u03bcM, while we did not detect any interaction with an unphosphorylated TCOF1 peptide ( ). A monomeric variant of KBTBD8, in which residues at the BTB interface were mutated to prevent adaptor dimerization ( ), bound the phosphorylated CK2 motif with a similar affinity as the wildtype dimeric KBTBD8 ( ), whereas mutation of its positively charged surface (KBTBD8 ) or competition with a negatively charged molecule known to interfere with CK2 substrate recognition, IP6, prevented substrate binding by KBTBD8 ( ). The latter finding underscores the importance of electrostatic interactions for substrate recognition by CUL3 . \n\nHaving observed the direct binding of phosphorylated TCOF1 to KBTBD8, we were able to reconstitute CUL3 -dependent substrate monoubiquitylation in a purified setting. We first allowed KBTBD8 to bind a phosphorylated TCOF1 fragment with two CK2-motifs, a step that was required for specific substrate modification. We then added neddylated CUL3-RBX1, E1, E2, and ubiquitin and found that the phosphorylated TCOF1 was efficiently monoubiquitylated ( ). No ubiquitin transfer was detected in the absence of ATP or KBTBD8 ( ); moreover, we observed a strong inhibition of ubiquitylation in the presence of KBTBD8 variants that were less efficient in binding TCOF1, including KBTBD8  or KBTBD8  ( ). We conclude that phosphorylation by CK2 marks TCOF1 and NOLC1 for recognition and monoubiquitylation by CUL3 . \n\n\n### TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain multiple recognition motifs for CUL3 \n  \nInterestingly, while KBTBD8  did not bind TCOF1 fragments with two or more CK2 motifs ( ), it associated with a peptide containing a single phosphorylated CK2 motif ( ). This implied that Trp579 stabilizes a conformation of KBTBD8 that is required for this E3 to engage more than one negatively charged CK2 motif at the same time. Consistent with this, we noticed that TCOF1 and NOLC1 each have more than 10 CK2 motifs that are embedded in the central acidic domain of low structural complexity ( ). To assess whether these motifs provide CUL3  recognition elements, we purified 24 distinct CK2 repeats from TCOF1 and NOLC1 and tested whether they could bind KBTBD8 in vitro. We found that KBTBD8 associated in a CK2-dependent manner with 10 CK2 motifs in TCOF1 and nine counterparts in NOLC1 ( ). These results were supported by cellular studies: TCOF1 was monoubiquitylated on distinct Lys residues that were in close proximity to nine different phosphorylated CK2 motifs ( ) ( ). TCOF1 and NOLC1 therefore do not contain a single, but many recognition motifs for CUL3 . \n   Multisite dependency of substrate recognition by CUL3 in vitro.  \n(  A  ) TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain multiple CK2 motifs (light green). Functional motifs are marked with a red dot (non-functional motifs typically contain Arg substitutions that are incompatible with recognition by CK2). The LisH domain is a protein interaction module found in many proteins, but often with unknown function. (  B  ) Multiple CK2 motifs are recognized by KBTBD8. TCOF1 or NOLC1 fragments containing single CK2 motifs (number according to position in sequence) were incubated with buffer or with CK2/ATP, immobilized on beads, and incubated with recombinant KBTBD8. Bound KBTBD8 was visualized by western blotting using a specific antibody. (  C  ) TCOF1 is ubiquitylated in vivo on multiple Lys residues that are all in close proximity to CK2 motifs. Ubiquitylated TCOF1 was purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells and ubiquitylated Lys residues were determined by mass spectrometry. The figure depicts the location of ubiquitylated lysine residues identified in individual peptides. (  D  ) The more CK2 motifs are in a substrate, the better it binds to KBTBD8. A single phosphorylated and fluorescently labeled CK2 motif of TCOF1 was bound to KBTBD8. Unlabeled TCOF1 competitor fragments containing either two (R1/2), three (R1/3), four (R1/4), six (R1/6) or eight (R1/8) CK2 motifs were phosphorylated and titrated into the binding reaction, and dissociation of the reporter peptide was monitored by loss of fluorescence polarization. ( ) The increase in affinity afforded by multiple CK2 motifs also applies to monomeric KBTBD8. A monomeric variant of KBTBD8 was produced by mutation of conserved residues at the BTB dimer interface, as described for KLHL12 ( ). Binding of a single phosphorylated CK2 motif of TCOF1 to monomeric KBTBD8 was then monitored in the presence of competitor peptides by fluorescence polarization, as described above. (  F  ) Multiple CK2 motifs increase substrate affinity for KBTBD8. TCOF1 fragments containing either two (R1/2), three (R1/3), four (R1/4), six (R1/6) or eight (R1/8) CK2 motifs were incubated with immobilized KBTBD8 either in the presence or absence of CK2. In the last two lanes, all TCOF1 fragments were mixed and incubated at the same time with KBTBD8. Binding was monitored by western botting (top lanes: input; bottom lanes: KBTBD8-immunoprecipitation). (  G  ) Multiple CK2 motifs increase substrate affinity towards KBTBD8 at low substrate concentrations.   Upper panel:   450 nM of TCOF1 fragments with a single (F2) or multiple (R1/2, R1/4, R1/8) CK2 motifs were incubated with either wild-type KBTBD8 or monomeric KBTBD8 , and KBTBD8 was then affinity-purified using a specific antibody.   Lower panel:   Same binding reaction as above, but TCOF1 was immobilized on beads. Complex formation was analyzed by western blotting. (  H  ) Dimerization of KBTBD8 is required for TCOF1, but not PKN1, binding in cells. Cells expressing indicated KBTBD8 variants were subjected to KBTBD8  affinity-purification and analyzed for dimerization (KBTBD8 ), CUL3-binding, or substrate recognition (TCOF1, PKN1) using Western blotting with specific antibodies. (  I  ) CUL3 -substrates with multiple CK2 motifs are monoubiquitylated. Ubiquitylation of TCOF1-R1/8, a fragment containing eight CK2 motifs, was analyzed in vitro using purified neddylated CUL3-RBX1, KBTBD8, E1, UBE2D3, ubiquitin and ATP, as described above. (  J  ) Ultrasensitivity of the KBTBD8-TCOF1 interaction. Binding of TCOF1-R1/8 to KBTBD8 was analyzed in the presence of increasing CK2 concentrations, as described in the  . Western blots of three independent experiments were quantified by Image J, and error bars denote standard deviation. Green curve: binding reaction in the absence of competitor; blue curve: binding of TCOF1-R1/8 in the presence of a ten-fold excess of TCOF1-R1/2, which mimics endogenous CK2 substrates that typically have one or two CK2 motifs. \n \n   N- and C-terminal TCOF1 fragments both require multiple CK2 motifs for recognition.  \nTCOF1 fragments containing different numbers of CK2 motifs were generated from a more C-terminal part of the protein and compared for their affinity to KBTBD8 to N-terminal fragments described in  . Note that the R3/8 fragment contains an inactive motif in between two and three active CK2 motifs, respectively, and it accordingly behaves like a TCOF1 fragment with three consecutive CK2 motifs (R1/3). \n  \n \n\n### Multisite dependency of CUL3  substrate recognition \n  \nWhy do TCOF1 and NOLC1 have so many recognition motifs for their E3? Multiple E3 binding sites might ensure robust substrate ubiquitylation, as backup sites could buffer mutation or defective phosphorylation of a single motif. If this were to be the case, increasing the number of CK2 motifs should not improve substrate affinity under conditions of saturating kinase activity. Alternatively, studies on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SIC1 found that multiple E3-binding sites could produce allovancy ( ;  ;  ): following dissociation of one SIC1-degron, neighboring E3 recognition motifs already in proximity to the enzyme rapidly rebind and thereby retain the interaction between the substrate and its E3. It would also be possible that multiple CK2 motifs access different positively charged patches on KBTBD8 in a multivalent manner. If the latter two mechanisms were at play for CUL3 , adding more CK2 sites would be expected to increase the affinity of substrates for this E3. Supporting these models, we found in a competition assay that the more CK2 sites were included in TCOF1, the better it bound KBTBD8 ( ;  ). We noted a particularly prominent increase in substrate affinity if TCOF1 fragments contained six or more CK2 sites ( ). \n\nWe confirmed these results by monitoring the ability of immobilized KBTBD8 to retain TCOF1 fragments with increasing numbers of CK2 motifs. When assayed at high substrate concentration, TCOF1 fragments with 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 CK2 motifs were all able to bind KBTBD8 in a CK2-dependent manner ( ). However, if all peptides were incubated with KBTBD8 at the same time, only TCOF1 fragments with six or more CK2 motifs were retained by the E3 ( ). When tested at substrate concentrations below the K  of a single CK2 motif, KBTBD8 only bound fragments with multiple CK2 motifs even in the absence of competition ( ). Under these conditions, KBTBD8 required dimerization for target recognition ( ), which was also seen with KBTBD8 immunoprecipitated from cells ( ), as well as in in vitro ubiquitylation assays ( ). In contrast to the effects on affinity, increasing the number of E3-binding sites did not alter the nature of ubiquitylation, and a TCOF1-fragment with eight CK2 motifs was still only monoubiquitylated by CUL3  ( ). Thus, CUL3  requires multiple CK2 motifs for optimal substrate recognition, a feature that is referred to as multisite dependency. \n\nMultisite dependency allows cells to translate small increases in the levels or activity of a kinase into large changes in signaling output ( ;  ), which can introduce ultrasensitivity needed for switch-like differentiation ( ). To test whether its mode of substrate recognition enables CUL3  to convert the gradual increase in CK2 levels during embryogenesis into decisive recognition of NOLC1 or TCOF1, we titrated CK2\u03b1/\u03b2 into reactions that monitored the binding of a TCOF1 fragment with eight CK2 motifs to KBTBD8; to mimic the cellular situation, where many proteins compete for access to CK2 ( ), we also included an excess competitor with two CK2 motifs. Notably, we found that in the presence of the competitor, TCOF1 was only able to bind KBTBD8 at high CK2 levels, where the affinity gain provided by eight phosphorylated CK2 motifs overcame the concentration advantage of the competitor ( ). Accordingly, the Hill coefficient of the TCOF1-KBTBD8 binding reaction increased from\u00a0~1 in the absence of a competitor to\u00a0~3.5 in its presence, which is indicative of ultrasensitive behavior. Based on these observations, we infer that multisite dependency of CUL3  provides a mechanism for cells to translate a slow increase in CK2 levels into switch-like E3 substrate recognition. \n\n\n### Multisite dependency by CUL3  controls substrate recognition in cells \n  \nWe finally wished to determine whether multisite dependency governed substrate regulation by CUL3  in cells. Different from in vitro conditions, we could not address this question by expressing TCOF1 or NOLC1 fragments with an increasing number of CK2 motifs, as truncated polypeptides would miss interaction surfaces for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and neural crest specification ( ;  ). Instead, we decided to inactivate distinct CK2 motifs in full-length NOLC1, which could be introduced into cells more reproducibly than the much larger TCOF1. We then tested how many functional CK2 motifs were required for NOLC1 recognition by CUL3 . \n\nBuilding off of our observation that introduction of Arg residues destroyed CK2 motifs ( ), we first generated a NOLC1 variant in which all but one CK2 consensus sites were inactivated (NOLC1 ). Contrary to the wildtype protein, NOLC1  failed to bind endogenous KBTBD8 either in 293 T cells or in differentiating hESCs ( ). Thus, although a single CK2 motif can mediate binding of NOLC1 to KBTBD8 in vitro ( ), it is not sufficient to mediate its CUL3 -recognition in vivo. We then reintroduced CK2 motifs into NOLC1  to generate NOLC1  (i.e. NOLC1 with three intact CK2 consensus sites), NOLC1 , NOLC1 , and NOLC1  ( ). Upon analyzing the behavior of these variants toward endogenous or overexpressed KBTBD8, we found that multiple CK2 repeats were required for an interaction between NOLC1 and KBTBD8, and wild-type NOLC1 with 10 CK2 motifs showed the strongest binding to KBTBD8 ( ). In line with these results, we found that CUL3 -dependent monoubiquitylation of NOLC1 and its ubiquitin-dependent association with TCOF1 required multiple CK2 motifs, and the most robust signaling was again observed in the presence of all phosphorylation sites ( ). Interestingly, NOLC1 variants with five or less CK2 motifs were ubiquitylated by an E3 ligase distinct from KBTBD8 ( ), which did not promote TCOF1-NOLC1 complex formation and has an unknown function ( ). \n   Multisite dependency of CUL3  substrate recognition in cells.  \n(  A  ) A single CK2 motif is not sufficient for substrate recognition by KBTBD8 in cells. Wild-type  NOLC1 or a mutant containing only a single CK2 motif ( NOLC1 ) were affinity-purified from 293 T cells and analyzed for binding to endogenous KBTBD8 and CK2 by western blotting using specific antibodies. (  B  ) A single CK2 motif is not sufficient for KBTBD8 and TCOF1 recognition by NOLC1 in differentiating hESCs.  NOLC1 was affinity-purified from hESCs or hESCs subjected to 1 day of neural conversion (NC1), and bound endogenous KBTBD8, TCOF1, or CK2 were detected by western blotting using specific antibodies. (  C  ) Scheme of CK2-mutants of NOLC1. CK2 motifs that remained functional are labeled with a red dot; the last two CK2 motifs of NOLC1 do not mediate KBTBD8-binding in vitro, as shown above. (  D  ) KBTBD8-recognition of NOLC1 depends on multiple CK2 motifs. The indicated NOLC1 variants were affinity-purified from 293 T cells and analyzed for binding to endogenous KBTBD8 or CK2\u03b2 by western blotting using specific antibodies. Note that wild-type NOLC1, which contains all 10 functional CK2 motifs is the most efficient KBTBD8-recruiter. (  E  ) Multisite dependency of NOLC1 ubiquitylation in cells. Ubiquitylated NOLC1 mutants were purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells that expressed  ubiquitin and, where indicated, KBTBD8 . Ubiquitylation of  NOLC1 was analyzed by \u03b1FLAG-Western; note that NOLC1 mutants containing up to five CK2 motifs are ubiquitylated by an E3 ligase distinct from KBTBD8 (i.e. ubiquitylation is observed in the absence of KBTBD8 expression in these cells). Ubiquitylation of endogenous PCNA was monitored by western blotting using specific antibodies. (  F  ) Multisite dependency of TCOF1-NOLC1 complex formation.  NOLC1 variants with increasing numbers of CK2 motifs were affinity-purified from 293 T cells that expressed KBTBD8 as indicated. Complex formation with endogenous TCOF1 was monitored by western blotting using specific antibodies. In addition, overexpression of KBTBD8 allowed for KBTBD8 recognition already in the presence of five CK2 motifs, consistent with multisite dependency providing an increase in affinity (i.e. that can in part be overcome by overexpression), rather than creating a specific complex E3 recognition element. \n  \nTo determine how many CK2 motifs were required for NOLC1-dependent neural crest specification, we depleted NOLC1 from hESCs using stably expressed shRNAs that targeted the 3\u2019-UTR of its mRNA. Consistent with previous findings ( ), the loss of NOLC1 prevented neural crest specification and induced compensatory expression of forebrain markers, as seen by qRT-PCR, western blotting, or fluorescence microscopy ( ). These phenotypes could be rescued by shRNA-resistant wild-type NOLC1, which underscores the specificity of our depletion approach ( ). When we introduced NOLC1 variants with increasing numbers of CK2 sites, we found that only those containing seven or more CK2 motifs were able to support neural crest specification ( ). As seen with KBTBD8 binding and formation of the NOLC1-TCOF1 platform, wild-type NOLC1 containing all ten CK2 sites was most efficient in driving neural crest specification. Although it is difficult to exclude unknown effects of point mutations, the ability of NOLC1 variants to support neural crest specification therefore closely mirrored their ubiquitylation by CUL3  in cells, and seven or more CK2 motifs need to be present in NOLC1 to allow for modification and function of this ribosome biogenesis factor. We conclude that multisite-dependency of CUL3  governs monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification, a switch-like change in cell fate. \n   Multisite dependency of CUL3  during neural crest specification.  \n(  A  ) Multiple CK2 motifs in NOLC1 are required for its role in neural crest specification. Control or NOLC1-depleted H1 hESCs were generated by stable expression of shRNAs. Cells were then reconstituted with doxycycline-inducible wildtype (WT) or CK-mutants of NOLC1 and subjected to neural conversion for 6 days. The outcome of cell differentiation was monitored by western blotting using specific antibodies against PAX6 (CNS precursor marker), SNAIL2 and SOX10 (neural crest markers), and GAPDH (control). (  B  ) Multiple CK2 motifs in NOLC1 are required for its role in neural crest specification. H1 hESCs expressing wild\u00a0type or NOLC1  variants were generated and subjected to neural conversion as described above, and the outcome of differentiation was monitored using qRT-PCR of markers of the CNS (FOXG1, SIX3, PAX6) or the neural crest (SOX10, SNAIL2, FOXD3). (  C  ) Multiple CK2 motifs in NOLC1 are required for its role in neural crest specification, as seen at single-cell resolution by fluorescence microscopy analysis. H1 hESCs expressing wild\u00a0type or specific NOLC1  mutants were generated and subjected to neural conversion as described above, and neural crest differentiation was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-SOX10 antibodies. (  D  ) Quantification of SOX10-positive cells in   (n\u00a0=\u00a03, two biological and one technical replicate; error bars denote s.e.m). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe central role of CUL3 in metazoan development ( ;  ;  ), and its frequent misregulation in cancer, autism, or hypertension ( ;  ;  ), implies that this E3 ligase needs to be under strict control. Providing a first mechanism of regulation, CUL3  constitutively ubiquitylates the transcription factor NRF2, until this reaction is prevented upon cysteine modification of KEAP1 during oxidative stress ( ;  ). Conversely, CUL3  regulates COPII vesicle size only after calcium has been released from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ). Here, we add another layer of regulation by showing that multisite phosphorylation is required for target recognition by CUL3 , an E3 ligase that controls neural crest specification ( ). While phosphorylation is a common event in promoting substrate recognition by SCF E3 ligases ( ), this example shows that similar regulation exists for the CUL3 family of E3 ligases. \n\n### Multisite dependency of substrate recognition by CUL3 \n  \nThe essential CUL3 -substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 each contain 10 or more motifs that can be independently phosphorylated by CK2 and mediate binding to KBTBD8 with comparable efficiency in vitro. Proteomic approaches found most of these CK2 motifs to be phosphorylated in cells ( ), which we confirmed in our own experiments. The CK2 motifs are spread throughout the central disordered domains of TCOF1 and NOLC1, and accordingly, we detected nine distinct monoubiquitylation sites on TCOF1 that were always in proximity to CK2 motifs. While we might have missed cellular ubiquitylation sites, these observations already suggested that multiple CK2 sites can function as CUL3 -recognition motifs. \n\nFluorescence polarization measurements showed that KBTBD8 recognizes a single CK2 motif with a dissociation constant of\u00a0~1 \u03bcM, and steady-state assays indicated that the affinity of KBTBD8 for most CK2 motifs in TCOF1 or NOLC1 is in a similar range. KBTBD8 therefore binds more than 10 distinct motifs in TCOF1 or NOLC1 with an affinity that is akin to that of the E3 ligases SCF  or UBR1 to their targets ( ;  ). However, a single CK2 motif was not sufficient for substrate binding by CUL3  in cells, where hundreds of proteins compete for access to CK2 ( ). The CUL3 -dependent binding and monoubiquitylation of NOLC1, formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes, and differentiation of hESCs into neural crest cells required at least seven CK2 motifs. We note that the presence of all 10 CK2 motifs resulted in more robust KBTBD8 recognition and neural crest specification, indicating that most, if not all, E3 binding sites contribute to CUL3 -substrate ubiquitylation and cell differentiation. We conclude that CUL3  relies on multisite substrate phosphorylation for optimal target selection. \n\nOur results are reminiscent of the yeast CDK inhibitor SIC1, whose recognition by the E3 ligase SCF  requires\u00a0~5\u20136 phosphorylation events ( ;  ;  ). In a mechanism referred to as allovalency, its multiple E3 binding sites allow the intrinsically disordered SIC1 to rapidly rebind SCF  after a single motif dissociated. Similar to SIC1, TCOF1 and NOLC1 have multiple E3 binding motifs that are embedded in an acidic domain of intrinsic disorder (IDRs). TCOF1 and NOLC1, however, differ from SIC1 in that they contain a positively charged carboxy-terminal IDR with nuclear and nucleolar localization signals. Biophysical work suggested that ampholytic IDRs, such as TCOF1 or NOLC1, adopt a compact globular conformation that can undergo rapid structural fluctuations ( ). We therefore speculate that most CK2 motifs in TCOF1 and NOLC1 are buried in a collapsed conformation of the IDRs, while some CK2 motifs are frequently, yet stochastically, exposed on the surface of the substrate. The exposed CK2 motifs are recognized by a conserved positively charged loop in KBTBD8 and potentially a second substrate binding site whose existence was implied by the behavior of the KBTBD8  variant. The compact conformation of its IDRs might limit the propensity of unstructured TCOF1 and NOLC1 to aggregate, while its multiple E3 recognition motifs ensure that ubiquitin-dependent signaling is still possible ( ). We propose that multisite dependency of an E3 ligase provides an elegant mechanism to control the activity of intrinsically disordered proteins, which have now been linked to many important cell behaviors ( ). \n   Model of multisite-dependent substrate recognition by CUL3 .  \nCUL3 -substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 are first phosphorylated by CK2 in conserved CK2 motifs (12 motifs in TCOF1; 10 motifs in NOLC1), which increases the negative charge of the central intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Phosphorylation likely occurs on multiple Ser residues within a CK2 motif (see insert). While the phosphorylated substrate likely adopts a compact conformation, CK2 motifs are stochastically exposed, allowing for their recognition by KBTBD8. We speculate that the resulting monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 opens up their conformations to allow for recognition of ribosome biogenesis factors, including RNA polymerase I, the pseudouridylation machinery, and the SSU processome. As shown previously ( ), the subsequent production of new, and likely modified, ribosomes then triggers neural crest specification. \n  \n\n### Implications for ubiquitin-dependent signaling \n  \nThe mechanism for CUL3 -substrate recognition implies that multiple residues in TCOF1 or NOLC1 could serve as acceptor sites for monoubiquitylation. As mentioned before, we found that TCOF1 is ubiquitylated in cells on several Lys residues, even though we have not observed multi-monoubiquitylation (i.e. multiple Lys residues in the same substrate are modified with ubiquitin at the same time). It is difficult to rationalize ubiquitylation events that are agnostic to a particular Lys residue with binding of effector proteins that typically recognize both ubiquitin and a proximal substrate motif ( ), and indeed, ubiquitin-binding domains have not yet been identified in TCOF1, NOLC1, or their interaction partners. Rather than promoting a specific interaction, we anticipate that the ubiquitin subunits attached to TCOF1 and NOLC1 function as steric block or solubilizing domain to pry open the compact conformation of both substrates. This conformational change could allow TCOF1 and NOLC1 to engage their partners during ribosome biogenesis and neural crest specification. Understanding this potential role of ubiquitylation in cellular signaling will rely on reconstitution of the monoubiquitylation-dependent formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes, which is currently impossible due to difficulties in the purification of these large and unstructured proteins. Why CUL3  stops after having transferred a single ubiquitin is also an open question that will be an interesting basis for experiments aimed at elucidating mechanisms of monoubiquitylation. \n\nMultisite phosphorylation allows cells to integrate numerous environmental cues into a coherent signaling response, or to introduce ultrasensitivity and threshold effects into signaling circuits ( ). In case of a distributive kinase, such as CK2, the probability of complete substrate phosphorylation decreases the more sites have already been targeted by the enzyme ( ). This behavior is likely exacerbated by the large number of CK2 substrates in cells that can act as sponges to titrate the kinase away from TCOF1 and NOLC1. Thus, while the low constitutive activity of CK2 in stem cells might lead to some TCOF1 or NOLC1-phosphorylation, only the increase in CK2 activity observed during nervous system development should enable phosphorylation to the extent required for substrate recognition by CUL3 . Based on these observations, we propose that multisite dependency of CUL3  establishes a threshold concentration for CK2, which needs to be surpassed for monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification at specific stages of embryogenesis. \n\nMutations in   TCOF1   are the major cause of Treacher Collins Syndrome, a craniofacial disease that is characterized by aberrant neural crest specification and survival ( ;  ). The mutations in   TCOF1   map throughout the IDR and typically lead to a truncated protein that has fewer phosphorylation sites and hence is less likely to engage in multisite phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation. These mutations also delete carboxy-terminal nuclear and nucleolar localization sequences ( ), and thus, additionally disrupt targeting of TCOF1 to the nucleolus. Treacher Collins Syndrome is further characterized by an environmental component that strongly affects the phenotypic strength of identical   TCOF1   mutations across patients. It is possible that DNA damage or oxidative stress, which result in TCOF1 modification by kinases other than CK2 ( ;  ;  ), compete with multisite phosphorylation by CK2. If this were to be the case, mutations that reduce the number of available CK2 sites and environmental conditions that funnel TCOF1 into alternative pathways likely synergize to prevent monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification. In these cases, our data suggests that inhibition of phosphatases that oppose CK2 or approaches that activate CK2 kinase output could ameliorate phenotypes of   TCOF1   mutation. Conversely, inhibition of CK2 might provide therapeutic benefit against melanoma, a cancer driven by aberrant expression of KBTBD8 ( ). Our discovery of multisite phosphorylation as key to CUL3 -substrate recognition and neural crest specification could therefore be an important step towards developing therapies against severe human pathologies. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Plasmids and shRNAs \n  \nFor transient expression in human cells, the following constructs were generated as previously described ( ): pCMV-3xFlag-TCOF1, pCMV-3xFlag-NOLC1, pCS2-3xHA-TCOF1, pCS2-HA-NOLC1, pCDNA5-KBTBD8(WT, Y74A, F550A, W579A)\u22123xFlag, pCDNA5-KBTBD8-(WT,Y74A)-HA, pCDNA5-KLHL12-3xFlag, pCS2-6xHis-ubiquitin. KBTBD8  (HKH296-298AAA, KK300-301AA) and monomeric KBTBD8  were generated by primer extension PCR using nested primers. To generate NOLC1  (NOLC1 mutant containing only one functional CK2 phosphorylation motif; all others were inactivated by mutation of two to three amino acids of the CK2 motif to Arg), the central repeat of NOLC1 was synthesized with the desired mutations as gBlock gene fragment (IDT) and cloned with its wild type N- and C-terminus into pCMV-3xFlag by Gibson assembly. To obtain NOLC1 , NOLC1 , NOLC1 , and NOLC1 , respective DNA fragments were PCR amplified from NOLC1-WT or NOLC1-CK2-1 and assembled by Gibson cloning ( ). \n   Mutations introduced in different NOLC1-CK2 mutants.    \nKBTBD8  and monomeric KBTBD8  were cloned into pFASTBacHTB with an N-terminal His-tag for expression in SF9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitrogen) as described for KBTBD8-WT, -F550A, and -W579A ( ).

In brief, lysates were prepared in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole by incubation with 200 \u03bcg/ml lysozyme and sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with Ni-NTA (QIAGEN) for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton followed by elution of proteins in 200 mM imidazole in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl. TEV protease for His-tag removal was added and proteins were dialyzed overnight into 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol. Proteins were concentrated and purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4. 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. KBTBD8 fractions were concentrated, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. \n\nTCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments were purified from E.coli LOBSTR cells. Cell were grown in LB medium to an OD600 of\u00a0~0.6 followed by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG to induce protein production at 37\u00b0C for 3 hr. Cells were harvested and lysed in 15 mL of lysis buffer A (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 3 U/mL Benzonase, 5 mg/mL Lysozyme) per 1.5\u00a0L of culture. After incubation for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, 10 mL of lysis buffer B (75 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 1425 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM PMSF, 15 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mM imidazole per 1.5\u00a0L culture were added followed by sonication on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. His-tagged TCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments were isolated using NI-NTA resin (Qiagen), washed with wash buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM imidazole), eluted in elution buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 250 mM imidazole), and transferred into storage buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol) by three cycles of concentration/dilution using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore, MWCO 3 kDa). Longer TCOF1 fragments (TCOF1-R1/6 and TCOF1-R1/8) were further purified by molecular sieving over a Superdex 200 column in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, followed by concentration of protein-containing fractions. Concentrated proteins were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. \n\nNedd8-modified CUL3/RBX1, CK2\u03b1, CK2\u03b1/\u03b2, and E1/UBE2D3 were purified as previously described ( ;  ;  ). Initial CUL3/RBX1\u00a0~\u00a0Nedd8 purifications were a kind gift from Brenda Schulman. \n\n\n### Mammalian cell culture and transfection \n  \nHuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid transfections of HEK 293 T cells were with PEI or TransIT-293 Reagent (MIR207, Mirus) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For in vivo ubiquitylation assays, a plasmid ratio of 7.5: 2.5: five for His-ubiquitin: KBTBD8: TCOF1/NOLC1 was used. 293 T cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma infections. \n\n\n### hESC cell culture \n  \nHuman embryonic stem (hES) H1 cells were obtained from the Wisconsin stem cell bank and maintained under feeder-free conditions on Matrigel-coated plates (#354277, BD Biosiences) in mTeSR\u00a01, (#05871/05852, StemCell Technologies Inc.). hES H1 cells were routinely passaged with collagenase (#07909, StemCell Technologies Inc.). hESCs were routinely tested for mycoplasma infection. \n\n\n### Lentiviral production and infection \n  \nLentiviruses were produced in 293 T cells by co-transfection of lentiviral constructs with packaging plasmids (Addgene) for 48 hr. Viruses were collected and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. For pINDCUER20 and pLENTI constructs, viruses were concentrated using LENTI-X concentrator (Takara) and directly used for infection. For pLKO1 constructs, supernatant was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. HEK293T cells were transduced in polybrene (6 \u03bcg/ml) and selected with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL puromycin for 5 days. hES H1 cells were transduced as single-cell suspensions (prepared by treatment with accutase; 2.5 \u00d7 10e5 cells per well of a six-well plate) and in the presence of polybrene (6 \u03bcg/ml) and 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor for 90 min. In case of pINDUCER20 and pLENTI constructs, cells were centrifuged during infection period at 30\u00b0C and 1000 g. After infection, medium was changed to mTESR containing 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor. Selection of cells hES H1 cells was performed for 7 days using appropriate antibiotics (pLKO1: 1 \u03bcg/mL Puromycin, pLENTI-Hygro: 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL hygromycin, pINDUCER20: 200 \u03bcg/mL G418). \n\n\n### Neural conversion of hESCs \n  \nNeural induction of hES H1 cells expressing different shRNA or protein constructs was performed using STEMdiff  Neural Induction Medium (#05831, StemCell Technologies Inc.) in combination with a monolayer culture method according to the manufacturer\u2019s technical bulletin (#28044) and as previously described ( ). In brief, single cell suspensions were prepared by treatment of hES cells with accutase (1.25 \u00d7 10  cells were seeded per well of a six-well plate in STEMdiff Neural Induction Medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor. Neural induction was performed for indicated time periods with daily medium change. To determine the effect of CK2 or PP1/PP2A inactivation on neural conversion, indicated concentrations of CX4945 or okadaic acid were added throughout the differentiation experiment. For NOLC1 rescue experiments, to induce expression of NOLC1 variants, 1 \u03bcg/mL doxycycline was added to indicated conditions for 12 hr before the start and until the end of the differentiation experiment. \n\n\n### Immunoprecipitation \n  \nSmall scale anti-FLAG and anti-HA immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed from extracts of HEK293T cells transiently expressing indicated constructs. Lysis was in two pellet volumes of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 50 mM NaCl 110 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc) , 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.2% NP-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche) on ice. Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, passaged through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filter, and incubated with ANTI-FLAG-M2 agarose (Sigma) or EZview Red Anti-HA affinity gel for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. After washing with lysis buffer, FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged protein complexes were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation of  NOLC1 from self-renewing and differentiating hESCs (hESCs undergoing neural conversion for 1d), 1 \u00d7 15 cm dishes of cells induced for flag-NOLC1 expression for 72 hr were used as starting material. \n\n\n### Mass spectrometry and compPASS analysis \n  \nFor mass spectrometry analysis,  NOLC1, and KBTBD8-5HK  immunoprecipitates (originating from 20 \u00d7 15 cm of transfected 293 T cells) were prepared and analyzed as previously described ( ). Samples were analyzed by the Vincent J. Coates Proteomics/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley and compared with\u00a0~150 reference immunoprecipitations against different FLAG-tagged bait proteins using a Java script programmed according to the CompPASS software suite ( ). To identify regulators of CUL3  function, we compared interactors found in IPs of its key targets  TCOF1 (published in [ ]) and  NOLC1 (this study). For both  TCOF1 and  NOLC1, three independent IPs were compared as replicates against the reference IPs. Thresholds for high confidence interaction partners (HCIPs) were top 5% of interactors with highest Z-score and highest WD score. We then plotted relative TSCs of HCIPs (normalized to 1000 TSC of bait) found in both  TCOF1 and  NOLC1 IPs. To assess the impact of the mutation of the 5HK loop on the KBTBD8 interaction network, we analyzed the abundance of KBTBD8 interactors (TSCs normalized to 1000 TSC of bait) found in IPs of different KBTBD8 variants by cluster analysis. For this we used data sets from KBTBD8-WT , KBTBD8-Y74A , KBTBD8-F550A , and KBTBD8-W579A  IPs ( ) and from KBTBD8-5HK  (this study). \n\nFor determination of TCOF1 ubiquitylation sites, His-ubiquitin,  TCOF1, and KBTBD8  were co-expressed in HEK 293 T cells and ubiquitylated TCOF1 conjugates were isolated by NiNTA pull down. Fractions were separated by SDS-Page, stained with Coomassie, and gel pieces containing TCOF1\u00a0~Ub conjugates were excised (appropriate gel pieces were identified by simultaneous immunoblotting of a small NiNTA fraction run on a different gel). Proteins were subjected to in-gel digestion using trypsin or gluC and analyzed by the Vincent J. Coates Proteomics/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley. Protein identification was done with IntegratedProteomics Pipeline (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc. San Diego, CA) using a false positive rate at the peptide level of 0.25%. Individual spectra for ubiquitylated peptides were inspected to ensure that fragments defined the ubiquitylation site. \n\n\n### Modeling of the KBTBD8 structure \n  \nA predicted 3D model of the KBTBD8 structure was obtained from the RaptorX web server. The derived model was processed and analysed using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version v1.3r1 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.). The conservation analysis was done using the ConSurf server ( ). \n\n\n### In vitro phosphorylation assays \n  \nTo ensure equal concentrations of purified TCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments for in vitro assays, protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23225, Thermo Scientific). TCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments in concentrations ranging from 3.5 to 500 \u03bcM were phosphorylated for 90 min at 30\u00b0C using CK2 (#P6010, NEB, or self-purified as described above; c \u00a0=\u00a00.1-2 \u03bcM) and ATP (0.4 mM-2 mM) in PK buffer (#B6022S, NEB). For unphosphorylated controls, either ATP or CK2 was substituted with H O. Phosphorylation reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and subsequently used for binding assays. \n\n\n### In vitro binding assays \n  \nFor KBTBD8 binding assays, ANTI-FLAG-M2 agarose (Sigma) beads were equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 110 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc) , 5 mM EGTA, 0.05% NP-40). Flag-tagged TCOF1 and NOLC1 fragments from phosphorylation reactions were added into a 200 \u03bcL reaction and incubated rotating for 1 hr at RT. Unbound protein fragments were rinsed three times with 400 \u03bcL binding buffer. KBTBD8 and KBTBD8 mutant protein (5-15 \u03bcg/sample) were added to the beads and incubated for 1 hr at RT on a rotator. After washing with binding buffer, bound protein was eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. \n\nFor TCOF1 fragment binding assays, Protein G agarose (Sigma) beads were equilibrated in binding buffer and incubated with KBTBD8 or KBTBD8 mutant protein and mouse anti-KBTBD8 antibody for 1 hr at RT. After washing out unbound protein with binding buffer, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated protein fragments were added to the reaction and incubated for 1 hr on a rotator. After washing out unbound fragments with binding buffer, bound complexes were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. \n\n\n### Determination of the ultrasensitivity of the KBTBD8-TCOF1 interaction \n  \nReactions of 4 \u03bcM TCOF1 fragment R1/8 in the presence or absence of tenfold excess of competitor peptide (TCOF1-R1/2) were phosphorylated with 1 mM ATP using indicated CK2 concentrations in PK buffer (#B6022S, NEB) at 30\u00b0C for 1 hr. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped via addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. \n\nProtein G agarose (Sigma) beads were equilibrated in binding buffer and incubated with KBTBD8 (5 \u03bcg/sample) and mouse anti-KBTBD8 antibody for 1 hr at RT. After washing out unbound protein, the phosphorylation reactions were added to immobilized KBTBD8 to a final concentration of 450 nM and incubated at RT for 1 hr. The binding reactions were washed, eluted in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. ImageJ was used for signal quantification of two individual experiments. GraphPad was used for subsequent data processing and analysis using the specific binding fit with Hill slope equation and data was plotted with the standard error of the mean. \n\n\n### Fluorescence polarization assays \n  \nTAMRA-labeled TCOF1 peptide (5,6-[TAMRA]AGQDSSSEDTSSSSDETDVEGKP, bioSyntesis) and competitor peptides were phosphorylated as described above. K  measurements were done at 100 nM TAMRA-TCOF1 peptide and indicated concentrations of KBTBD8 and KBTBD8 mutant proteins in triplicates and duplicates, respectively. Competition assays were done in duplicates with 5 \u03bcM KBTBD8 and 2.5 \u03bcM KBTBD8 \u0394dimer and indicated concentrations of TCOF1 competitors. Fluorescence polarization signal was measured using a BioTek Synergy H4 plate reader after 30 min incubation at RT in the dark. Data was processed and analyzed in GraphPad using the specific binding fit with Hill slope equation and plotted with the standard error of the mean. \n\n\n### In vitro ubiquitylation assays \n  \nFor in vitro ubiquitylation assays, 2 \u00b5M of His6x-FLAG-TCOF1-R1/2 and His6x-FLAG-TCOF1-R1/8 proteins were phosphorylated as described above and bound to anti-FLAG agarose in a 100 \u00b5L reaction volume at RT for 1 hr. Beads were washed with binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 50 mM NaCl, 110 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc) , 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% NP-40) and incubated with 2 \u00b5M of KBTBD8 in a 100 \u00b5L reaction volume at RT for 1 hr, followed by two washes of binding buffer. Liquid was removed completely from beads and 20 \u00b5L ubiquitylation mix (0.5 \u00b5M Ube1, 1.0 \u00b5M UBE2D3, 40.0 \u00b5M ubiquitin, indicated concentrations of Cul3/Rbx1\u00a0~\u00a0Nedd8, and 1 mM ATP in 20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl ) were added. Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 hr and then quenched by addition of 20 \u00b5L of 2X sample buffer. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Of note, immobilizing the substrates on FLAG-agarose and pre-binding KBTBD8 was required for specific substrate modification. \n\n\n### In vivo ubiquitylation assays \n  \nFor detection of TCOF1 and NOLC1 ubiquitylation, HEK293T cells were transfected with  Ubiquitin and KBTBD8 . To determine the effect of CK2 inactivation, cells were stably transfected with control or shRNAs targeting CK2\u03b2 before plasmid transfection and treated with 20 \u03bcM CX4945 24 hr after plasmid transfection. To determine the effect on inactivation of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases, cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM okadaic acid for 30 min prior to lysis. Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection, washed with PBS, lysed in 8M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole and sonicated.  Ubiquitin conjugates were purified by incubation and rotation with NiNTA agarose for 1 hr at room temperature. Beads were washed 2x with lysis buffer and 2x with lysis buffer at pH 6.3. Ubiquitin conjugated were eluted in sample buffer and ubiquitylated proteins were detected by SDS page followed by immunoblotting. \n\n\n### Quantitative real time PCR analysis \n  \nFor qRT-PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted and purified from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 74104) and transcribed into cDNA using the RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (#K1621, Thermo Scientific). Gene expression was quantified by Maxima SYBR Green/Rox qPCR (#K0221, Thermo scientific) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Nonspecific signals caused by primer dimers were excluded by dissociation curve analysis and use of non-template controls. To normalize for loaded cDNA, RPS6 was used as endogenous control. Gene-specific primers for qRT\u2013PCR were ordered pre-designed from Integrated DNA Technologies. Primer sequences are summarized in  . \n   qPCR primers used in this study    \n\n### Immunofluorescence microscopy \n  \nFor immunofluorescence analysis, hES H1 cells or hES H1 cells expressing different shRNA and/or proteins and subjected to neural conversion for indicated time periods were seeded on Matrigel-coated converslips using accutase, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permabilized with 0.1% Triton for 20 min, and stained with anti-SOX10 antibodies and Hoechst. Random Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 20x objective and processed using ImageJ. SOX10-positive cells and total nuclei were counted (~150\u2013200 cells per condition for each of the three replicates) and average percentage of SOX10-positive cells was determined. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6057744, "text_md5": "c9e3a065fd0f0ba40a411107e616a7dc", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 86], "journal": [87, 92], "publication_year": [94, 98], "title": [109, 203], "keywords": [217, 300], "abstract": [313, 1424], "body": [1433, 73305]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 29999490, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.35407", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6057744", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6057744"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6057744\">6057744</a>", "list_title": "PMC6057744  Multisite dependency of an E3 ligase controls monoubiquitylation-dependent cell fate decisions"}

We compared differential gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of SCZ patients who tested positive for APDs at the time of death with SCZ patients who did not. APD exposure was associated with numerous changes in the brain transcriptome, especially among SCZ patients on atypical APDs. Brain transcriptome data from macaques chronically treated with APDs showed that APDs affect the expression of many functionally relevant genes, some of which show expression changes in the same directions as those observed in SCZ. Co-expression modules enriched for synaptic function showed convergent patterns between SCZ and some of the APD effects, while those associated with inflammation and glucose metabolism exhibited predominantly divergent patterns between SCZ and APD effects. In contrast, major cell-type shifts inferred in SCZ were primarily unaffected by APD use. These results show that APDs may confound SCZ-associated gene expression changes in postmortem brain tissue. Disentangling these effects will help identify causal genes and improve our neurobiological understanding of SCZ. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRecent large-scale transcriptome studies have identified hundreds to thousands of differentially expressed genes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) [ ,  ]. Functional interpretation of these massive transcriptional changes remains an ongoing effort. Postmortem transcriptome data is often highly confounded, requiring extensive correction for various technical and demographic variables. Antipsychotic drug (APD) use is one potential confounder that is particularly difficult to account for. Since nearly all SCZ patients are exposed to APDs and severely ill patients are exposed to more APDs, the effects of APDs on postmortem human brain transcriptome are challenging to separate from those of SCZ itself. Despite recent attempts to assess the transcriptional impact of APDs on postmortem human brain [ ,  ], the effects of APDs on the prefrontal cortex transcriptome and their relationship with SCZ remain poorly understood. Some evidence suggests that APDs induce gene expression changes consistent with those seen in SCZ [ \u2013 ]. In contrast, other studies indicate that APDs may drive the expression of some genes in opposite directions to those seen in SCZ [ \u2013 ]. Here we assessed the transcriptomic effects of APD use in SCZ using a novel approach that compared SCZ-associated gene expression changes between individuals taking APDs at the time of death with those who were not. We also examined transcriptome data from healthy macaques administered APDs and integrated these data with the human data. Our findings suggest that APD exposure contributes in complex ways to gene expression changes seen in SCZ, with important implications for the biological interpretation of findings from human postmortem brain studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Atypical APD use is correlated with a more prominent SCZ signature \n  \nTo investigate the effect of APD exposure on postmortem gene expression changes, we calculated an aggregate score of SCZ-associated differential gene expression\u2014here referred to as the \u201cSCZ expression signature\u201d (see \u201cMethods\u201d)\u2014across groups of DLPFC samples in the NIMH Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) taken from donors diagnosed with SCZ. We grouped the samples by toxicology results detected in postmortem blood into samples that tested positive (  n  \u2009=\u200965) or negative (  n  \u2009=\u200923) for any APD, and further subdivided the APD-positive group into those where typical (  n  \u2009=\u200927), atypical (  n  \u2009=\u200928), or mixed (both types;   n  \u2009=\u200910) APDs were detected. \n\nAPD exposure at the time of death was associated with numerous changes in the brain transcriptome. Individuals in the atypical APD group had the most pronounced differential gene expression changes compared to psychiatrically healthy controls, followed by the mixed APD, APD-negative, and typical APD groups (Fig.  ). Further examination of those testing positive for a single APD compound revealed that samples with clozapine and olanzapine had the highest SCZ expression signature, followed by samples with risperidone, fluphenazine, and haloperidol (Fig.  ). Similar results were obtained with the SCZ expression signature calculated based on the larger PsychENCODE dataset [ ] (Supplementary Fig.  ) and in a smaller independent validation cohort with associated postmortem brain toxicology data from UC Irvine (Supplementary Fig.  ). Similarly, traditional differential gene expression analyses for SCZ subgroups showed that individuals with atypical APD exposure had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table  ). These findings show that transcriptional differences between SCZ cases and controls are larger in APD-positive cases, particularly those treated with atypical APDs.    SCZ-associated differential gene expression between toxicological subgroups.  \n a   Aggregated scores of differential gene expression (SCZ expression signatures) are shown based on toxicological findings (Neg.: negative for any APD; Pos.: positive for atypical, typical, or both APD [mixed] classes). Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (KWt) on all groups:   p  \u2009=\u20093.83e-10; KWt within SCZ subgroups only:   p  \u2009=\u20090.014. For details and post hoc Dunn tests, see Supplementary Table  .   b   As in   a   but SCZ samples were divided into groups of 3 or more cases positive for a single APD (atypical APDs: clozapine [  n  \u2009=\u20093], olanzapine [  n  \u2009=\u20098], risperidone [  n  \u2009=\u20096]; typical APDs: haloperidol [  n  \u2009=\u200914], fluphenazine [  n  \u2009=\u20095]). SCZ expression signatures were based on gene expression values residualized for major influential covariates, such as sex, age, RNA integrity, and postmortem interval (see \u201cMethods\u201d). \n  \n\n\n### SCZ expression signatures are correlated with APD signatures in macaques \n  \nDifferential gene expression in the human brain can reflect both APD exposure and disease severity. To study the effects of APDs on gene expression in relative isolation, we used published transcriptome data from the DLPFC of healthy rhesus macaques treated with either clozapine, haloperidol, or placebo [ ]. While the differential gene expression analysis did not yield any genes that passed a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%, a gene ontology analysis of the top nominally significant genes did show significant enrichment of terms related to immunological processes, metabolism, and synaptic transmission (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). These functional enrichments are also similar to those previously found for haloperidol and clozapine in rodent forebrain tissue [ ,  ]. A direct comparison between mouse and macaque APD effects showed high concordance for haloperidol and low but significant concordance for clozapine (Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nTo harness information across conserved, functionally relevant gene co-expression networks, we applied signed consensus WGCNA [ ] across the macaque and human datasets. We identified 37 consensus modules. Relationships of these modules with APD exposure in macaques and SCZ in humans, along with functional enrichments, were examined (Fig.  ). Some module eigengenes (e.g., M16, M9) were associated with APD exposure in the opposite direction from that observed in SCZ; this divergence is consistent with a \u201cnormalizing\u201d effect of APDs in those modules. Other modules (e.g., M11, M25, M31) showed concordant association in the same direction for APD treatment and for SCZ, suggesting that treatment and disease are confounded in those modules (Fig.  ). These convergent changes were primarily observed for macaques treated with haloperidol, while those treated with clozapine exhibited an inconsistent or divergent pattern for these modules. Notably, these modules were enriched for synapse-related terms, including a module (M25) enriched for genes prioritized in the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SCZ [ ]. Modules enriched for inflammatory response (M16), glucose homeostasis (M9), and mitochondria (M18) exhibited a predominantly divergent pattern. In summary, APD exposure in monkeys induced changes in gene expression across distinct, functionally relevant, conserved gene networks that were both convergent and divergent with those seen in SCZ.

For a full list of genes and enriched gene ontology terms, see Supplementary Table  . \n  \n\n\n### Schizophrenia-related cell-type shifts are largely unaffected by APD exposure \n  \nPrior studies have implicated cell-type shifts in SCZ pathogenesis [ ,  ]. To examine if APD use may contribute to or reverse SCZ-associated cell-type shifts, we estimated cell-type proportions in the bulk transcriptome data based on single-nucleus reference data from the same brain bank (manuscript under review) using Bisque [ ] and compared cases and controls based on their toxicological profile. This comparison revealed significant decreases in GABAergic neurons and nominally significant increases in astrocytes in the DLPFC of all SCZ samples. APD positivity at the time of death did not significantly affect cell-type proportions within the SCZ group (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ).    Estimated cell-type proportions for human and macaque DLPFC samples.  \n a   Cell-type proportions of excitatory neurons (ExN), inhibitory neurons (InN), and astrocytes (Astro) in bulk DLPFC tissue of SCZ cases with different toxicological profiles (groups as in Fig.  ) estimated via corresponding single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles. Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (KWt) on all groups:   p  \u2009=\u20090.908;   p  \u2009=\u20090.0318;   p  \u2009=\u20090.0689; KWt within SCZ subgroups only:   p  \u2009=\u20090.798;   p  \u2009=\u20090.875;   p  \u2009=\u20090.565. Mann\u2013Whitney   U  -test (MWU) between SCZ and controls was significant for InN (  p  \u2009=\u20090.00159) and Astro (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0176). Only InN remained significant after FDR correction.   b   Estimated proportions of ExN, InN, and Astro in bulk DLPFC of monkeys treated with clozapine (CLZ), haloperidol (low dose: HAL.lo; high dose: HAL.hi), or placebo. KWt:   p  \u2009=\u20090.0433;   p  \u2009=\u20090.547;   p  \u2009=\u20090.336. MWU between APDs and placebo was significant only for HAL.hi in ExN (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0379). For detailed test statistics, see Supplementary Table  . For the other cell types, see Supplementary Fig.  . \n  \n\nTo study the effect of APD exposure alone on cell-type proportions, we also deconvolved DLPFC transcriptome data from macaques treated with APDs using single-cell data from adult macaque DLPFC [ ]. We found no significant cell-type shifts except a slight decrease in glutamatergic neurons in animals treated with high-dose haloperidol, possibly indicating cytotoxic effects (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ). Together with the cell-type deconvolution results in humans, these data suggest that any inferred cell-type shifts observed in SCZ are likely unrelated to APD exposure. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe show that APD exposure at the time of death confounds SCZ-associated differential gene expression in postmortem brain. These findings suggest that some of the differential gene expression previously attributed to SCZ may in fact, be driven by APD exposure. This is especially true among individuals treated with the atypical APDs commonly used in recent years. The more prominent SCZ gene expression signature in these individuals could reflect gene expression changes induced by APDs themselves, the illness itself, or a combination of both. An important consideration is that toxicological tests only reflect acute effects of APD use at the time of death rather than chronic APD intake, which can span several decades. APD-negative individuals are typically not na\u00efve to APD treatment since practically all patients diagnosed with SCZ are prescribed APDs. \n\nAPDs exert complex effects on the brain transcriptome. Gene expression data from macaques treated with clozapine and haloperidol indicated that APD exposure could alter gene expression in the same direction as observed in human SCZ samples for some genes and the opposite direction for other genes. Although the macaque data reflect the transcriptional effects of APD intake alone, the data are limited by sample size, potential differences between species, and differences in the APD exposure (6 months for macaques versus typically many years for humans with variable regimens and compliance). Nonetheless, some convergent effects between APD exposure in macaques and SCZ in humans support the conclusion that APDs contribute to (and may thus confound) gene expression changes observed in SCZ. Interestingly, several modules with a convergent pattern of APD and SCZ effects (typically downregulated) were enriched for synaptic function. These modules also showed discrepancies between haloperidol and clozapine administration in macaques, with haloperidol effects being more convergent, and clozapine effects being less convergent or divergent, with SCZ effects. Although synapse-related genes are enriched in SCZ risk loci, our results suggest that the differential expression of these genes reported in postmortem brains from patients with SCZ may be related in part to the effects of APD exposure with some contrasting effects across different types of APD. Modules with a divergent pattern included those enriched for glucose homeostasis, mitochondria, and inflammatory response. These results are consistent with prior literature on dysregulation of energy metabolism in SCZ and complex actions of APDs on these pathways [ ,  ], as well as potential modulation of neuroinflammatory response and activation states of microglia [ ,  ]. While not all genes in these modules exhibited the same pattern, our findings support the notion that the therapeutic properties of APDs comprise metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects, not just the effects on synaptic transmission. \n\nWhile APDs may contribute to differential gene expression in SCZ, the drugs do not appear to induce or reverse major cell-type shifts previously associated with SCZ. Our deconvolution of bulk gene expression data suggests that SCZ is associated with a reduction in GABAergic neurons and an increase in astrocytes. Interestingly, while cell-type enrichment of genetic risk loci [ ,  ,  ] and recent single-nucleus RNA-seq case\u2013control studies in SCZ [ \u2013 ] primarily implicate cortical pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons, our results are consistent with many previous marker-based and other studies of inferred changes in cell-type proportions [ ,  \u2013 ]. These inferred cell-type shifts occurred regardless of APD exposure. APD exposure alone also did not induce significant cell-type shifts in macaques. Cell-type deconvolution approaches can help infer major cell-type shifts but are affected by specific characteristics of the reference dataset and limited in their resolution of rare or closely related cell subtypes or cell-type-specific differential gene expression without significant shifts in overall cell number. For example, estimated proportions of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors were not significantly changed, but some of their marker genes,   CX3CR1   and   PDGFRA  , were found in the \u201cdivergent\u201d module M11 (Fig.  ). \n\nWe have identified APD exposure as an important confounder in postmortem gene expression studies of SCZ patients. Several lines of evidence support the contribution of APDs to differential gene expression in SCZ. The widespread use of APDs in SCZ makes it difficult to account for APD exposure in human postmortem brain studies. Postmortem toxicology and medication history may help address this dilemma, but a more complete assessment of the transcriptional effects of APDs will require larger sample sizes of both human and non-human primates. Future studies should employ improved cell-type resolution (through use of single-nucleus profiling), assess other relevant brain regions [ ] (such as basal ganglia and thalamus, which appear to be most affected by APD use [ ,  ]), and integrate transcriptional data with genetic determinants of SCZ risk, APD response, and longitudinal changes in brain structure [ ]. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Human and macaque brain tissue samples \n  \nThe human (CMC_HBCC) and macaque (CMC_macaque) brain specimens have been previously described [ ]. Human brain samples were collected under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) with permission of the next of kin. Clinical diagnoses were based on family interviews and a review of medical records using DSM-IV criteria. Unaffected controls were defined as having no history of a psychiatric condition or substance use disorder, and negative toxicology. The CMC_macaque data consisted of gene expression data from DLPFC of rhesus macaques treated with clozapine (5.2\u2009mg/kg/day), low-dose haloperidol (0.14\u2009mg/kg/day), high-dose haloperidol (4\u2009mg/kg/day), or placebo for 6 months. \n\n\n### Toxicology screening \n  \nToxicology was performed on postmortem blood obtained at the time of autopsy as previously noted [ ] via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by the medical examiner and/or by National Medical Services ( ). A forensic panel which includes several medications commonly used in psychiatry including antipsychotics, was run, but additional compounds were tested when information was available indicating that the patient was taking a medication that was not included in the panel. Toxicological screening for antipsychotics in blood and brain produce highly consistent results [ ], although concentrations tend to be higher in brain compared to blood [ ,  ]. Therefore, when a negative result for antipsychotics was detected in blood, the tests were repeated in cerebellar tissue. Two of the 25 samples that were APD-negative in blood but APD-positive in the cerebellum were removed from the analysis. \n\n\n### Transcriptome data \n  \nRNA-seq counts from the CMC_HBCC and CMC_macaque studies were downloaded from the CommonMind Consortium portal on synapse.org and analyzed in R. For CMC_HBCC, we included gene expression data from DLPFC of cases with schizophrenia and unaffected controls with associated toxicology data; we excluded technical replicates and cases with age of death under 17 years (age of youngest SCZ case). Genes with counts-per-million (CPM)\u2009>\u20091 in \u226550% of the samples for CMC_HBCC and \u22653 samples in the CMC_macaque data were included. Trimmed mean of   M  -values (TMM) normalization was performed in edgeR [ ] followed by further analysis using limma/voom [ ,  ] and principal component analysis (PCA) on logCPMs. We removed two outlier samples with a PC score >5 standard deviations from the mean in two or more of the top 20 PCs in CMC_HBCC and one outlier sample with a PC score >3 standard deviations from the mean in two or more of the top 20 PCs in CMC_macaque. The demographics of both datasets are summarized in Tables   and  .   \nOverview of the human dataset. \n  \n f   female,   m   male,   AA   African American,   Cauc   Caucasian,   SD   standard deviation,   Age a  ge of death in years,   PMI   post-mortem interval in hours,   RIN   RNA integrity number. \n    \nOverview of the macaque dataset. \n  \nAcronyms as in Table  . \n  \n\n\n### Differential gene expression \n  \nWeighted least-squares regression via limma/voom [ ] was used to produce covariate-corrected residuals prior to differential gene expression.

Colinear covariates were regressed sequentially until no more significant correlations were found. \n\nThe model for CMC_HBCC was: \n\nThe model for CMC_macaque was: \n\nThe residuals from these models were then used to conduct differential gene expression tests in limma between SCZ cases and controls in CMC_HBCC or each treatment and placebo in CMC_macaque.   p   Values were adjusted for multiple testing via the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method. \n\n\n### Aggregated score of differential gene expression (\u201cSCZ expression signature\u201d) \n  \nTo aggregate differential gene expression in SCZ per sample across many genes, we projected (via dot product) covariate-corrected gene expression values for each sample onto the SCZ betas (i.e. log fold change) for all genes with a nominal   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 for SCZ. \n\nA higher score indicates gene expression deviating from the mean in the direction of SCZ, while a lower score indicates changes in the direction of controls. To ensure that differences in the covariates such as age, sex, RIN, PMI, and pH were not driving the values, residuals from the above-mentioned regression models in limma were used for the score calculation. \n\n\n### Validation dataset for human DLPFC \n  \nFor validation of human DLPFC findings, we used a small case\u2013control dataset (15 controls, 15 SCZ cases) with associated toxicology derived from brain tissue (cerebellum) as previously described [ ]. Raw gene expression data was processed using adapter trimming via cutadapt and pseudoalignment to the human transcriptome (GENCODE v32) via Salmon [ ]. Counts were summarized at the gene level, and only genes with CPM\u2009>\u20091 in \u22653 samples were included. One control sample was removed due to low RIN (<5). TMM normalization was performed in edgeR [ ] followed by linear regression analysis via limma/voom [ ]. The model used for covariate adjustment was: \n\nResiduals from this model were used for differential gene expression tests between SCZ cases and controls in limma and for aggregating differential gene expression per sample by projecting them onto the SCZ betas for all genes with a nominal   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 for SCZ, as described above. \n\n\n### Comparison between macaque and mouse APD effects \n  \nTo compare the chronic effects of clozapine and haloperidol in macaque DLPFC to those previously described for the same APDs in another species, we used a mouse forebrain gene expression dataset consisting of animals treated with clozapine or haloperidol for 12 weeks or untreated controls (  n  \u2009=\u200910 per group) [ ]. RMA-normalized Affymetrix mouse expression array MOE430A data were downloaded from GEO (accession: GSE6512) and processed using limma [ ]. Normalized intensity values were averaged across multiple probes for the same gene and differential gene expression tests were performed comparing the clozapine and haloperidol groups against untreated controls in limma. For each APD group in macaques, the corresponding   t  -statistics for the genes with one-to-one orthologs between macaque and mouse are shown in Supplementary Fig.  . \n\n\n### Consensus WGCNA \n  \nTo identify conserved functional gene co-expression networks shared between humans and macaques, we performed consensus WGCNA [ ] between the two species. Gene expression data from CMC_HBCC and CMC_macaque were corrected for all technical covariates (i.e. library batch, effective mapping rate, intergenic rate, RIN, PMI, pH). Only genes with a one-to-one ortholog between the two species were used as input data. To obtain conserved co-expression modules with consistent directionality of effect, a consensus WGCNA was run with \u201csigned\u201d network type, soft thresholding power of 12, minimum module size of 30, deepSplit of 2, mergeCutHeight of 0.25, and minKMEtoStay of 0.3. The relationship of module eigengenes for each human and macaque sample were then investigated using a linear model: \n\n\n### Functional enrichment \n  \nGene ontology categories for each gene were obtained from BioMart (Ensembl version 86 [GRCh38] for CMC_HBCC and 75 [Mmul_1; GRCh37] for CMC_macaque) and tested for enrichment using Fisher\u2019s exact test. All expressed genes served as the background distribution, further restricted to one-to-one matches for WGCNA module enrichment analyses. GWAS enrichment was tested using Fisher\u2019s exact test based on overlap with prioritized genes (FINEMAP, SMR, rare damaging mutations) in the most recent SCZ GWAS [ ]. \n\n\n### Cell-type deconvolution \n  \nMajor cell-type proportions were estimated using Bisque [ ] via the reference data-based method and all expressed genes as the input. For CMC_HCC, single-nucleus RNA-seq data from human DLPFC (manuscript under review; overlap of 5 samples was used to improve the model) served as a reference. For CMC_macaque, single-nucleus RNA-seq data from adult macaque DLPFC [ ] was used as reference data (these data did not include microglia). Unsupervised clustering of single-nucleus data was visualized via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots using the top 20 principal components on the top 2000 most variable genes in Seurat (Supplementary Fig.  ). In the macaque single-nucleus reference data, endocytes, and pericytes were combined, and clusters ExN9 and Astro2 were removed due to clustering separately from most excitatory neurons and astrocytes, respectively. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis and plotting conventions \n  \nThe distribution of aggregated SCZ differential gene expression scores and estimated cell-type proportions were tested for normality using a Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Both were significantly different from a normal distribution, and therefore non-parametric tests were used for all group comparisons (Mann\u2013Whitney   U  -test with two groups; Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with multiple subgroups; post hoc Dunn test for individual subgroup tests). Module eigengenes were tested for association with APD treatment in macaques and SCZ in humans using linear regression followed by two-sided   t   tests, although normality of module eigengene distribution was not formally tested. To account for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. Differential gene expression results and effect sizes (log fold changes) are listed in Supplementary Tables   and  . Fisher\u2019s exact test results and odds ratios for gene ontology term over-representation are shown in Supplementary Table   for differentially expressed genes and Supplementary Table   for consensus WGCNA modules. All other statistical test results and effect sizes are listed in Supplementary Table  . In all boxplots, the boxes extend up to the upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers extend up to 1.5 interquartile ranges from the upper and lower quartiles. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10023659, "text_md5": "874f5117d60ac5cab353344c0cc46fd5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 199], "journal": [200, 217], "publication_year": [219, 223], "title": [234, 336], "keywords": [350, 387], "abstract": [400, 1734], "body": [1743, 28207]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 36932057, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-023-02392-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10023659", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10023659"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10023659\">10023659</a>", "list_title": "PMC10023659  Antipsychotic drug use complicates assessment of gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia"}

We sought to create a model of EP dysfunction for the purposes of transcriptional analysis and treatment testing. By administering a single dose of cisplatin, a commonly prescribed cancer treatment drug with ototoxic side effects, to the adult mouse, we acutely disrupt EP generation. By combining these data with single cell RNA-sequencing findings, we identify transcriptional changes induced by cisplatin exposure, and by extension transcriptional changes accompanying EP reduction, in the major cell types of the SV. We use these data to identify gene regulatory networks unique to cisplatin treated SV, as well as the differentially expressed and druggable gene targets within those networks. Our results reconstruct transcriptional responses that occur in gene expression on the cellular level while identifying possible targets for interventions not only in cisplatin ototoxicity but also in EP dysfunction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe stria vascularis (SV) is a stratified epithelial tissue located in the lateral wall of the mammalian cochlea that generates and maintains the endocochlear potential (EP) and regulates the secretion of endolymph ( ;  ). Endolymph possesses a high potassium concentration that creates a positive potential of 80\u2013120 mV in the endolymph-containing scala media relative to the perilymph-containing compartments of the cochlea. The EP is the driving force for hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction and hearing. SV cell types, which express several critical ion channels, work together to generate the EP. Importantly, mutations in SV ion channel genes related to EP generation result in hearing loss in humans ( ). \n\nMore broadly, mutations in genes expressed by SV cell types result in hearing loss in mammals. In mouse, mutations in genes expressed by marginal cells of the SV, including   Slc12a2  ,   Atp1b2  ,   Kcnq1  , and   Kcne1  , result in a loss or reduction of EP and deafness ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ).   Slc12a2   encodes Na+/K+/Cl\u2013 symporter 1 (NKCC1), which is expressed at the basolateral membrane of SV marginal cells and is responsible for transporting potassium from the intrastrial space into marginal cells ( ). The loss of SLC12A2 results in deafness in mouse models ( ;  ;  ) and has recently been implicated in human hearing loss ( ;  ).   Atp1b2   encodes the \u03b22 subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) protein, which has been shown to be expressed in the basolateral membranes of mouse SV marginal cells ( ;  ;  ;  ). Similar to NKCC1, NKA pumps out cations from the SV to maintain a high potassium concentration and positive EP in the endolymph in the scala media ( ;  ;  ;  ). ATP1A1 and ATP1B2, encoded by   Atp1b2  , form the Na+/K+-ATPase that is essential for maintaining the low potassium concentration in the intrastrial space and is important for the generation of the +80 mV endocochlear potential in the scala media ( ). Decline in EP is associated with the loss of Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the stria vascularis ( ) and direct inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase with ouabain has been shown to reduce the EP ( ). These data suggest that   Atp1b2   is essential for EP generation. \n\n Kcnq1   and   Kcne1   encode the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv7.1, which is expressed on the apical surface of the marginal cell and plays a crucial role in secreting potassium into the endolymph and maintaining the EP. Conditional   Kcnq1   null mice exhibit a collapse of Reissner\u2019s membrane, loss of EP, and are deaf ( ). Mutations in   KCNQ1  /  KCNE1   result in human deafness and have been reviewed previously ( ). Similarly, genes expressed by intermediate cells including   Kcnj10   and   Met   cause hearing loss in humans ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Notably,   Kcnj10   encodes Kir4.1, which is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel expressed on the apical (marginal cell-facing) membranes of intermediate cells, that has been shown to be critical for EP generation with its loss resulting in hearing loss in both mice and humans ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Furthermore, loss of Ednrb has been shown to result in the reduction of EP ( ). While loss of   Met   expression has not been demonstrated to specifically result in loss or reduction of EP, dysfunctional HGF/MET signaling resulting from a knock-in mouse of a human mutation of   HGF   has been implicated in the reduction of EP through a reduction in intermediate cells ( ). Finally, mutations in genes expressed by SV basal cells, including   Cldn11  ,   Gjb2   and   Gjb6   have been implicated in the reduction of EP and hearing loss. Loss of   Cldn11  , which encodes the CLDN11 protein that is expressed in tight junctions of SV basal cells, has been shown to result in deafness and reduced EP in   Cldn11   null mice ( ;  ).   Gjb2   and   Gjb6   encode gap junctions expressed by SV basal cells and, to a lesser extent, intermediate cells ( ;  ,  ). Mutations of   GJB2   and   GJB6   are associated with deafness in humans ( ;  ) and have been shown to result in hearing loss and a reduction in EP in mouse ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Thus, existing literature emphasizes the importance of genes and proteins expressed by SV cell types in both hearing and EP generation. \n\nPreviously, our group has utilized single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the gene regulatory networks of the major SV cell types, including marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, that underlie SV homeostatic functions, including EP generation in the adult mouse ( ). Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) define and maintain cell type-specific transcriptional states, which in turn underlie cellular morphology and function ( ;  ). From this perspective, cells and their respective states are defined by a combination of transcription factors (TFs) that interact with a set of target genes to produce a specific gene expression profile. Perturbation of cell state through genetic, epigenetic, or pharmacologic means may provide insight into the contribution of these GRNs to cell function ( ;  ;  ;  ). Diseases or pharmacologic treatments represent perturbations of GRNs and investigation of these states at the single cell level may shed light on critical GRNs that underlie human disease or responses to treatment by potentially identifying key regulators in these GRNs ( ;  ;  ). \n\nCisplatin is commonly used to treat patients with a variety of cancers and results in permanent hearing loss in 35\u2013100% of treated adults due to its ototoxicity as reviewed by  . Recently,   demonstrated long term retention of cisplatin in the SV of both mice and humans, as measured by platinum concentration over time. These authors also demonstrated accompanying declines in EP in a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity that mimics the treatment and time course seen in humans undergoing cisplatin treatment for cancer ( ). In this model, cisplatin treatment results in temporary decline in the EP after the 1st cycle that gradually recovers but eventually becomes permanent after three cycles of cisplatin and accompanies hearing loss ( ;  ). SV retention of cisplatin combined with the decline in EP and its known ototoxic effects in humans prompted us to investigate the underlying transcriptional changes in SV cell types associated with cisplatin exposure to identify GRNs involved in the loss of EP-generating function in the SV. \n\nTo investigate the acute transcriptional response of the SV to cisplatin instead of the cumulative effects of cisplatin exposure, a mouse model for acute cisplatin-induced ototoxicity consisting of the dose equivalent (14 mg/kg, IP) to one cycle of cisplatin was utilized based on the cisplatin-induced ototoxicity mouse model by  . Using this mouse model for acute cisplatin-induced ototoxicity to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying EP generation and maintenance, we demonstrate that the decline in EP associated with cisplatin treatment is associated with changes in known SV cell type-specific EP-related genes at the protein and RNA levels by fluorescence immunohistochemistry and digital droplet qPCR (ddPCR), respectively. \n\nTo further investigate transcriptional changes associated with a decline in EP in response to cisplatin treatment, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of cisplatin-treated adult SV and compared these transcriptional profiles to our previously published unperturbed adult SV scRNA-Seq dataset ( ). In addition to corroborating our observations with known EP-related genes, we identify cell type-specific gene regulatory networks associated with differentially expressed EP-related genes. Among the major SV cell types, we demonstrate that marginal and intermediate cells are differentially affected by cisplatin treatment and we define differentially expressed genes as they relate to select EP-related GRNs affected by cisplatin. Finally, we utilize Pharos  to identify druggable gene targets in these GRNs that are preferentially affected by cisplatin. We pinpoint potentially repurposable FDA-approved drugs that may counteract transcriptional changes induced by cisplatin. More generally, analyses of these data serve as an example of a bioinformatic pipeline designed to identify druggable targets and potentially repurposable drugs to reverse not only cisplatin-induced hearing loss but also hearing loss related to stria vascularis dysfunction. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Treatment With Cisplatin Results in a Reduction in EP but Without Obvious Structural Abnormalities \n  \nCisplatin-treated mice have a reduced EP compared to control mice (Control mean EP = 86.96 mV, Cisplatin-treated mean EP = 58.43 mV,   p   = 0.0012) ( ). EP measurements were obtained 24 h after treatment in control (  n   = 12) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 10) mice that were given a single IP injection of saline or 14 mg/kg cisplatin, respectively. Given the constraints of performing auditory brainstem response (ABR) and EP recordings at the same time point, ABR thresholds ( ) and hair cell counts ( ) were analyzed in a parallel cohort of control (  n   = 6) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6) mice. ABR thresholds measured at the 8, 16, 32, and 40 kHz frequencies were unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   > 0.9999) ( ). Inner (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.6434) and outer (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.6423) hair cell counts between cisplatin-treated and control cochlea in the apical and basal turns were comparable and did not demonstrate a significant difference between conditions ( ). DPOAE amplitudes between control and cisplatin-treated mice were unchanged in both left and right ears ( ). Additionally, SV cross-sectional area in the apical, medial, and basal turns of the cochlea was unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.7680) ( ). Similarly, SV thickness in the apical, medial, and basal turns of the cochlea was unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.0554) ( ). Total nucleus counts in the SV in the apical, medial, and basal turns of the cochlea were unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.3974) ( ). Furthermore, the number of TUNEL-positive cell nuclei, calculated as a percentage of the total nuclei, was unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice across apical, medial, and basal cochlear turns (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.8282) ( ). Representative TUNEL staining in SV cross-section co-labeled with DAPI and phalloidin are shown ( ). Together these data indicate that a single injection of 14 mg/kg cisplatin resulted in reduced EP and suggest that hearing loss and hair cell death at this time point is not significant. \n  \nA single dose of cisplatin (14 mg/kg, IP) results in a reduction in EP after 24 h with no reduction in ABR threshold, minimal structural change, and no evidence of increased apoptosis.   (A)  , EP measurements obtained 24 h after treatment in control (  n   = 12) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 10) demonstrate that cisplatin-treated mice have a reduced EP compared to control mice (  p   = 0.0012).   (B)   In a separate cohort of mice, ABR thresholds measured at the 8, 16, 32, and 40 kHz frequencies were unchanged between control (  n   = 6) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6) mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   > 0.9999).   (C)   SV cross-sectional area was unchanged between conditions in all cochlear turns (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.7680).   (D)   SV thickness was unchanged between conditions in all cochlear turns (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.0554).   (E)   Total nucleus counts in the SV were unchanged between conditions in all cochlear turns (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.3974).

We observed that at 24 h after cisplatin injection, SLC12A2 immunofluorescence intensity was significantly reduced in the apical and basal turns of the cochlea (two-way ANOVA,   p   < 0.0001; Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test,   q   = 0.0068 and   q   = 0.0022, respectively) ( ), with representative cross sections of control ( ) and cisplatin-treated mice ( ). Immunofluorescence staining intensity of KCNJ10, which is known to be expressed on the apical (marginal cell-facing) membranes of intermediate cells ( ;  ;  ), was unchanged between control and cisplatin-treated mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.1784) ( ), with representative cross sections of control ( ) and cisplatin-treated mice ( ). Finally, CLDN11 (claudin 11) immunofluorescence staining intensity, a tight junction protein expressed by SV basal cells, was reduced in the basal turn of cisplatin-treated compared to control mice (two-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.0002; Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test   q   = 0.0418) ( ), with cross sections of control ( ) and cisplatin-treated mice ( ). \n  \nExpression of key EP-related cell-type specific proteins is reduced in the SV after cisplatin treatment.   (A)   Twenty four hours after cisplatin injection, SLC12A2 immunofluorescence intensity was significantly reduced in the apical and basal turns of the cochlea (two-way ANOVA,   p   < 0.0001; Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test,   q   = 0.0068 and   q   = 0.0022, respectively).

We utilized ddPCR of whole isolated SV to quantify the effect of cisplatin-treatment on the expression of these EP-related genes in the SV to gain a better sense of the transcriptional response with respect to EP-generating mechanisms. In whole isolated SV, we observed a significant reduction in selected EP-related genes specific to marginal cells:   Kcne1   (  q   = 0.0020),   Kcnq1   (  q   = 0.0161),   Atp1b2   (  q   = 0.0020), and   Slc12a2   (  q   = 0.0020) (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction) ( ). A significant reduction in an EP-related gene specific to intermediate cells:   Met   (uncorrected   p   = 0.0064) was seen between control and cisplatin-treated mice (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction) ( ). Expression in whole dissected SV of other known EP-related intermediate cell-specific genes including   Kcnj10   (  p   = 0.1746) and   Ednrb   (  p   = 0.5309) were not reduced in cisplatin-treated compared to control.   Ednrb   expression has previously been identified in the stria vascularis ( ;  ;  ;  ) and is identified as an intermediate cell-specific gene in the dataset published by   as shown in the gene Expression Analysis Resource (gEAR) . Finally, expression of EP-related genes in basal cells, including   Gjb2   (  q   = 0.0207) was significantly reduced, while   Gjb6   (  q   = 0.1086), and   Cldn11   (  q   = 0.4012), were not decreased in cisplatin-treated compared to control mice (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction) ( ). Both GJB2 and GJB6 protein have been previously shown to be expressed by basal cells and intermediate cells ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). CLDN11 is a well-established specific marker for basal cells in the stria vascularis ( ;  ;  ;  ). The limited sensitivity of ddPCR to changes at the cell type level when assaying whole SV tissue may account for the inability to detect changes in cell type-specific genes between control and cisplatin-treated mice. Nonetheless, ddPCR analysis of cisplatin-treated SV suggest that RNA transcription related to EP generation is adversely affected by cisplatin. Due to our limited ability to resolve cell type-specific responses in the SV in response to cisplatin and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional response to cisplatin at the cellular level in the SV, we then utilized scRNA-Seq to perform transcriptional profiling of the SV in cisplatin-treated adult mice. \n  \nddPCR of dissected SV demonstrates a reduction in several EP-related genes after cisplatin treatment. In whole dissected SV, we observed a significant reduction in selected EP-related genes specific to marginal cells:   Kcne1   (  q   = 0.0020),   Kcnq1   (  q   = 0.0161),   Atp1b2   (  q   = 0.0020), and   Slc12a2   (  q   = 0.0020) (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction). A significant reduction in two EP-related genes specific to intermediate cells:   Met   (uncorrected   p   = 0.0064) and   Kcnj13   (uncorrected   p   = 0.0117) was seen between control and cisplatin-treated mice (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction). Expression of other known intermediate cell-specific genes including   Kcnj10   (  p   = 0.1746) and   Ednrb   (  p   = 0.5309) were not reduced in cisplatin-treated compared to control. Expression of EP-related genes in basal cells, including   Gjb2   (  q   = 0.0207) was significantly reduced, while   Gjb6   (  q   = 0.1086), and   Cldn11   (  q   = 0.4012), were not decreased in cisplatin-treated compared to control mice (unpaired multiple   t  -test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction). *  p   < 0.05; **  p   < 0.01; ***  p   < 0.001. \n  \n\n### scRNA-Seq of Cisplatin-Treated Adult SV Demonstrates Similar Cell Populations as scRNA-Seq of Untreated Adult SV \n  \nMajor cell types in cisplatin-treated SV were identified using published markers ( ), demonstrating the capture of marginal, intermediate, and basal cells in pink, green, and blue, respectively, using a uniform manifold and projection (UMAP) clustering ( ). The genes   Kcne1   and   Kcnq1   were used as markers to identity marginal cells,   Kcnj10   and   Cd44   were used to identify intermediate cells, and   Cldn11   and   Tjp1   were used to identify basal cells. Additional clusters were identified using published markers and included cell types adjacent to and within the structure of the stria. These included the fibrocytes of the lateral wall, cells of Reissner\u2019s membrane that separate the scala media from the scala vestibuli, the spindle cells at the edges of the SV, and various lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid populations including neutrophils, B-cells, macrophages, and red blood cells (RBCs) ( ). Bioinformatic clustering revealed similar SV cell type-specific clusters across both cisplatin-treated and untreated SV single cell RNA-Seq datasets ( ). Cell type-specific gene expression in both the cisplatin-treated and control SV datasets is provided as a supplement ( ). \n  \nscRNA-Seq of cisplatin-treated adult SV demonstrates all the expected cell populations as untreated adult SV. Uniform manifold and projection (UMAP) clusters identified using published markers, showing marginal, intermediate, and basal cells in pink, green, and blue, respectively. Each dot represents a single whole cell. Additional cell types identified were spindle cells, fibrocytes, Reissner\u2019s membrane cells, neutrophils, B-cells, macrophages, and red blood cells (RBCs). \n  \n\n### Transcriptional Changes in Response to Cisplatin Reveal a Preferential Effect on Marginal and Intermediate Cells in SV \n  \nTo examine the transcriptional effects of cisplatin treatment on SV cell types, we performed three separate differential expression (DE) analyses on marginal, intermediate, and basal cells between cisplatin-treated and control SV cells ( ). Volcano plots depict differential gene expression of the marginal ( ), intermediate ( ), and basal ( ) cell types. Volcano plots depict expression of genes, represented by filled circles, enriched in cisplatin-treated SV cells to the right and genes enriched in control SV cells to the left. Fold-change thresholds in log2 scale (fold-change = \u00b1 1.25) correspond to the vertical dotted lines along the horizontal axis and the   p  -value threshold in log  scale (  p  -value = 0.0001) corresponds to the horizontal dotted line along the vertical axis. The higher along the vertical axis, the more significant the   p  -value and the further along in either the negative or positive direction from the dotted line, respectively, the greater the fold-change expression in either the control or cisplatin treated SV cells. Circles in red depict genes that met set threshold criteria (fold-change threshold >1.25,   p   < 0.0001). DE analysis of major SV cell types suggests that cisplatin has a greater effect on SV marginal and intermediate cells as supported by the larger number of differentially expressed genes ( ). On closer examination, EP-related genes specific for SV marginal cells (  Slc12a2  ,   Kcne1  ,   Atp1b2  ,   Kcnq1  ) are enriched in control cells suggesting downregulation of these genes in response to cisplatin in marginal cells ( ). Furthermore, control SV intermediate cells demonstrate an enrichment for many EP-related genes (  Gjb2  ,   Gjb6  ,   Kcnj10  ,   Met  ) suggesting a downregulation of these genes in response to cisplatin ( ). In contrast to SV marginal and intermediate cells, basal cells demonstrated few differentially expressed genes ( ). Gene ontology (GO) biological process analysis for genes upregulated in cisplatin-treated cells compared to control cells revealed an enrichment for genes involved in signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane (GO:0006614), ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (GO:0042775), and negative regulation of viral entry into host cell (GO:0046597) in marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, respectively. GO biological process analysis for downregulated genes revealed an enrichment for genes involved in membrane repolarization (GO:0086009), peptidyl-serine phosphorylation (GO:0018105), and mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (GO:0042775) in marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, respectively. GO analysis for both upregulated and downregulated genes suggest that cisplatin has differential effects on cells in the stria vascularis and suggest future areas for potential investigation. Together, these data suggest that SV marginal and intermediate cells demonstrate preferential effects on their transcriptome in response to cisplatin. We provide a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for SV marginal, intermediate, and basal cells between cisplatin-treated and control adult mice ( ). \n  \nDifferential expression analysis reveals the transcriptomic changes in individual cell types of the SV after cisplatin treatment.   (A)   Volcano plot depicting differential gene expression between the scRNA-Seq data of marginal cells of control and cisplatin-treated mice. Genes are represented by circles, with genes enriched in cisplatin-treated SV cells to the right and genes enriched in control SV cells to the left. Positive and negative fold-change thresholds (FC \u00b1 1.25) in log2 scale are represented by the vertical dotted lines. The   p  -value threshold (  p  -value \u00b1 0.0001) in \u2013log10 scale is represented by the horizontal dotted line. Red circles are genes that exceed both fold change and   p  -value threshold criteria. Green circles are genes that exceed the fold change threshold but not the   p  -value threshold. Blue circles are genes that exceed the   p  -value threshold but not the fold change threshold. Gray circles are genes that do not meet either threshold criteria.   (B)   Differential gene expression between the scRNA-Seq data of intermediate cells of control and cisplatin-treated mice.   (C)   Differential gene expression between the scRNA-Seq data of basal cells of control and cisplatin-treated mice. \n  \nUtilizing a larger group of upregulated and downregulated genes, we utilized ddPCR of cisplatin-treated and control whole isolated SV to validate the dataset ( ). Upregulated genes that demonstrated consistency between ddPCR and scRNA-Seq included   Cdkn1c  ,   Kcnj13  ,   Mt1  , and   Mt2   ( ). Despite a trend toward increased expression, the apparent inconsistency for   Anxa2  ,   Cdkn1a  ,   Gpx2  ,   Ifitm  , and   Mlana   between ddPCR and scRNA-Seq could be due to the insensitivity of a whole tissue assay to changes at the single cell level. Downregulated genes including   Aes1  ,   Aif1l  ,   Gas2  ,   Itpr1  ,   Itpr2  ,   Mt3  ,   Nrep  , and   Tns1   demonstrated consistency between ddPCR and scRNA-Seq ( ). Overall, these findings validate downregulation of genes associated with cisplatin treatment. \n\n\n### Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) Analysis of Cisplatin-Treated SV Using SCENIC Identifies Cell Type-Specific Regulons \n  \nRegulons are defined as transcription factors and their motif-enriched downstream target genes. We have previously utilized SCENIC to identify homeostatic cell type-specific regulons in the adult SV ( ). SCENIC analysis along with regulon specificity score (RSS) (  and  ) analysis of cisplatin-treated adult SV single cell transcriptomes reveals regulons specific for marginal, intermediate, and basal cells. RSS is a measurement of a regulon\u2019s degree of specificity to a cell type within a single cell data set. Fourteen, twelve, and nine cell-type specific regulons were identified corresponding to marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, respectively. Of these regulons, eight marginal cell regulons, four intermediate cell regulons, and five basal cell regulons were unique to the cisplatin-treated SV. Due to the apparent preferential effect on the transcriptional profiles of marginal and intermediate cells, we focused our attention on marginal and intermediate cell regulons in cisplatin-treated SV. We selected two regulons identified in the cisplatin-treated scRNA-Seq data as examples for our pipeline of cell-type specific regulatory intervention: Kruppel like factor 10 (  Klf10  ) in marginal cells and T-Box transcription factor 2 (  Tbx2  ) in intermediate cells. In both cases, their RSS scores are above the threshold for specificity for their respective cell types (  for the Klf10 regulon and   for the Tbx2 regulon), the transcription factor for each regulon is differentially expressed between control and cisplatin-treated cochlea, and there are multiple downstream targets with FDA approved drugs that either promote or inhibit expression. We utilized ddPCR to quantify the expression of   Klf10   and select downstream targets, including   Atp1b2  ,   Tspan1  , and   Cldn3   ( ), as well as the expression of   Tbx2   and select downstream targets, including   Kcnn4  ,   Ndufb2  , and   Tubb5   ( ) in cisplatin-treated SV to provide supportive evidence for the existence of these regulons. These analyses allowed us to identify cell type-specific regulons that are present in the cisplatin-treated adult SV. \n\n\n### Regulon Analyses Identified Potential Therapeutic Gene Targets in Marginal and Intermediate Cells for Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity \n  \nGiven that SV marginal and intermediate cells appeared to be preferentially affected by cisplatin treatment compared to SV basal cells, we focused on selected regulons for SV marginal and intermediate cells based on high RSS scores and presence of EP-related genes. These regulons and their downstream targets serve as examples of potential cell type-specific therapeutic targets. SCENIC analysis identifies the Kruppel like factor 10 (  Klf10  ) regulon as a regulon that is present specifically in marginal cells of cisplatin-treated SV. SCENIC analysis did not show presence of the   Klf10   regulon in the control RNA-Seq dataset.   Klf10   has been broadly implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as TGF\u03b2 signaling and is thought to function as a tumor suppressor gene ( ;  ). Differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-Seq data suggests that transcripts for   Klf10  , Claudin 3 (  Cldn3  ), and Tetraspanin 1 (  Tspan1  ) are enriched in cisplatin-treated marginal cells. Conversely, DE analysis suggests that transcripts for activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (  Alcam  ), ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 2 (  Atp1b2  ), Carbonic anhydrase 12 (  Ca12  ), Glutamyl aminopeptidase (  Enpep  ), Protein-arginine deiminase type-2 (  Padi2  ), and Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (  Spp1  ) are downregulated in cisplatin-treated marginal cells ( ). \n\nIn intermediate cells, SCENIC analysis identified that the T-Box transcription factor 2 (  Tbx2  ) regulon is present in cisplatin-treated SV.   Tbx2   has been broadly implicated in cell proliferation, induction of EMT, and senescence bypass ( ;  ;  ). Based on DE analysis, regulon-specific transcripts that were enriched in cisplatin-treated intermediate cells include NADH dehydrogenase 1 beta subcomplex subunit 2 (  Ndufb2  ), and Tubulin beta class I (  Tubb5  ). Tbx2 regulon-specific transcripts that were downregulated in response to cisplatin include   Tbx2  , Tyrosine-protein kinase (  Abl1  ), ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 1 (  Atp1b1  ), Endothelin receptor type B (  Ednrb  ), Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (  Met  ), and cAMP-specific 3\u2019,5\u2019-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4B (  Pde4b  ) ( ). Altogether, these analyses suggest that EMT and cell proliferation processes may play a role in the response to cisplatin in the SV marginal and intermediate cells and identify possible druggable gene targets to modulate the response to cisplatin. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study utilized a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity in which a single dose of cisplatin was used to reduce the EP. Our data using this model reveals cell-type specific transcriptional responses in the EP-generating cells of the stria vascularis in response to cisplatin. We demonstrate that SV marginal and intermediate cells are preferentially affected by cisplatin exposure, which is consistent with the role of these cells in generating the EP. Finally, we also demonstrate a pipeline for identifying druggable targets and repurposable drugs using a model of SV dysfunction, which might identify candidates for intervening in cisplatin-related and strial-related hearing loss. \n\n### Single Cell Transcriptional Profiling of Cisplatin-Treated SV Identifies Potential Novel Therapeutic Gene Targets to Mitigate Ototoxicity \n  \nWe suggest that genes involved in SV function that are downregulated in response to cisplatin may be reasonable targets for augmentation to mitigate the effects of cisplatin on the SV. Therapeutic gene targets that are downregulated in response to cisplatin include   Alcam  ,   Atp1b2  ,   Spp1  , and   Car12  . Reduced   Alcam   expression has been previously associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier and its expression may be implicated in blood-labyrinth barrier function ( ).   Atp1b2  ,   Spp1  , and   Car12   are known to be expressed in different cell types in the stria vascularis and lateral wall, notably marginal cells ( ;  ;  ).   Atp1b2   and   Car12   have been previously implicated in EP generation ( ;  ). ddPCR validate downregulation of Atp1b2, a gene critical to EP generation, is downregulated in SV marginal cells in response to cisplatin ( ). On the other hand,   Spp1  , or secreted phosphoprotein 1, has not been implicated previously in EP generation. Schmitt and colleagues examined cochlear effects of loss of   Spp1   in response to cisplatin and found no change in   Spp1   expression by immunohistochemistry and no difference in auditory brainstem responses between   Spp1   wild-type and   Spp1   null mice 72 h after cisplatin treatment, concluding that   Spp1   did not appear to mitigate cisplatin ototoxicity ( ). Our scRNA-Seq data demonstrates decreased expression of   Spp1   in marginal cells in response to cisplatin ( ). Reduced expression of the SPP1 protein after cisplatin treatment was validated using immunofluorescence intensity analysis ( ). Properties of   Spp1   include cell death inhibition, which presents a rationale for examining whether augmentation of   Spp1   levels in marginal cells could mitigate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity ( ). Thus, augmenting expression of genes downregulated in response to cisplatin in cell types responsible for EP generation may be an avenue for pursuing otoprotection. \n\nConversely, we suggest that certain genes that are upregulated in the presence of cisplatin may be reasonable targets for inhibition to mitigate the effects of cisplatin on the SV. Novel therapeutic gene targets that are upregulated in response to cisplatin include   Klf10  ,   Cldn3   encoding claudin 3, and Tspan1 encoding Tetraspanin 1, which are part of the   Klf10   regulon. While not previously characterized in the inner ear,   Klf10   overexpression has been implicated in renal podocyte dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy with suppression of   Klf10   shown to reduce diabetes-induced proteinuria and kidney injury in mice ( ). Despite similarities between the kidney and the stria vascularis ( ;  ;  ;  ), the known interacting partners of   Klf10   in the kidney ( ), including   Kdm6a  , nephrin (  Npsh1  ), and methyltransferase   Dnmt1  , are not differentially expressed in the stria vascularis (see  ). Our   Klf10   regulon analysis identifies   Tspan1   as a potential downstream target that is differentially regulated in marginal cells in response to cisplatin ( ). Tetraspanins are thought to act as molecular scaffolds for adhesion, signaling, and adaptor proteins ( ). While the role of   Tspan1   as well as the larger family of tetraspanins remains largely undefined in the inner ear, increased expression of   Tspan1   has been observed in a wide variety of cancers including gastric, colon, pancreatic, liver and esophageal cancer and has been implicated in cancer cell migration and invasion ( ). Whether these upregulated genes act as compensatory versus detrimental adaptations in response to cisplatin remains to be determined. If detrimental, these gene targets may be candidates for inhibition to mitigate ototoxicity. \n\n\n### Identification of Novel Potential Therapeutic Targets to Identify Drug Candidates That Could Be Repurposed to Reduce Strial Damage \n  \nIn order to enhance the robustness of our drug repurposing analyses, we utilized two druggable genome databases, Pharos ( ) and DrugBank ( ). Utilizing these databases, druggability of differentially expressed genes in the   Tbx2   regulon revealed potential therapeutic gene targets in intermediate cells in the form of target genes that were druggable by FDA approved drugs ( ). Pharos has a specific focus on drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors, protein kinases, and ion channels ( ), and has been utilized previously by our group to identify potential druggable gene targets ( ). Within Pharos, target genes that are druggable by at least one FDA approved drug are designated as Tclin target genes. Gene targets with FDA approved drugs in DrugBank are searchable and are shown along with known and unknown interactions of FDA-approved drugs. As a result of our druggable targets analysis of differentially expressed genes in the intermediate cell-specific   Tbx2   regulon, we identify metformin as a potential repurposable drug candidate targeting   Ndufb2   ( ;  ) to test for potential to mitigate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity as an example of this repurposing drug candidate approach.   Ndufb2   is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I assembly and has been implicated previously in bacterial sepsis ( ) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( ), suggesting that it may play a role in inflammation. Metformin, a well-known medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, has both anti-inflammatory ( ;  ) and antitumor ( ;  ;  ;  ) properties with several clinical trials currently underway to study its potential benefit in the setting of cancer ( ). The antitumor properties of metformin are thought to be potentially mediated through the MTOR signaling pathway ( ).   Ndufb2   encodes the B2 subunit of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Anti-inflammatory properties of metformin may in part be mediated by its ability to limit the production of reactive oxygen species by NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase, which may limit induction of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1\u03b2 and boost anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 ( ). Recently, metformin has been found to have some beneficial properties as it relates to hearing protection in preclinical and clinical studies against a variety of insults to the inner ear including radiation, noise, and cisplatin, as well as in the recovery of hearing in the setting of sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These observations suggest the possibility that metformin may have broader therapeutic applications as it relates to hearing. \n\n\n### Understanding the Mechanisms by Which Cisplatin Alters Strial Function Prior to Hair Cell Loss May Inform Strategies to Prevent Hair Cell Loss \n  \nIn the model utilized in this study, we examined the acute changes that occur in the cochlea in the presence of a reduced EP. Outer hair cells are more susceptible to cisplatin-induced death than inner hair cells ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), as is the case in other models in which reduced EP precedes hair cell death. In genetic models of EP dysfunction ( ;  ;  ) without a known ototoxin, outer hair cell loss occurs in a delayed fashion after the observed reduction in EP despite the appearance of normally developed hair cells. As the SV generates the EP and establishes the environment for proper hair cell functioning, we speculate that hearing loss prior to outer hair cell degeneration in the setting of EP dysfunction may be due to the sustained effect of a reduced EP on active cochlear amplification by outer hair cells and that the loss of EP may be involved indirectly in the degeneration of outer hair cells ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Alternatively, work by Sewell demonstrates that reductions in EP resulting from furosemide administration are accompanied by elevations in in auditory nerve thresholds and suggest the loss of EP may have an effect at the auditory nerve ( ). While acknowledging this as speculative, work by our group and others suggests that alterations in the local extracellular ionic composition of the endolymph surrounding the outer hair cells may have an impact on their function and status ( ;  ;  ). Alternatively, alterations in EP may initially impact cochlear function prior to effects on the hair cells by impacting auditory nerve fiber activity. Regardless, understanding how disruption of critical SV functions, including EP generation, are associated with hair cell loss, albeit delayed, may be important in identifying ways to prevent hair cell loss and, ultimately, hearing loss. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nWe utilized a single dose of cisplatin as a model of SV disease and EP generation dysfunction prior to the onset of deleterious effects of the drug on hearing and hair cells and then examined the transcriptional changes within specific SV cell types. Druggable target databases were then used to predict drugs that might mitigate or reverse these transcriptional changes. Our data at the RNA and protein levels indicate that cisplatin impairs stria vascularis function. We have identified cell-type specific regulatory pathways involved in the response to cisplatin, and these pathways have been used to suggest existing drugs that may mitigate cisplatin ototoxicity. In this way, we identify transcriptional changes that occur apparently prior to the onset of hearing loss that may be therapeutically targeted to prevent cisplatin-related ototoxicity. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Animals \n  \nInbred CBA/J male and female mice were purchased from JAX (Stock No. 000656). P30 mice obtained from breeding pairs were used for all experiments including EP measurements, immunohistochemistry, digital droplet qPCR (ddPCR) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq). \n\n\n### Cisplatin and Saline Intraperitoneal Injection \n  \nExperimental mice were given an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 14 mg/kg cisplatin 24 h prior to EP measurement or sacrifice. Control mice were given an equal volume IP injection of saline 24 h prior to EP measurement or sacrifice. All mice were age P30 for these experiments. \n\n\n### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nMethods have been previously described ( ;  ). Briefly, inner ears from P30 CBA/J mice were dissected and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight. Fixed adult mouse inner ears were then decalcified in 0.25 M EDTA for 4\u20135 days, transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by immersion in half 30% sucrose in PBS and super cryoembedding medium (SCEM) (C-EM001, Section-Lab Co, Ltd.; Hiroshima, Japan), followed by embedding in 100% SCEM for 2 h at room temperature, frozen in a cryomold biopsy square. \n\nFor cryosectioning, adhesive film (C-FUF303, Section-Lab Co, Ltd.) was fastened to the cut surface of the sample in order to support the section and sectioned slowly using a CM3050S cryostat microtome (Leica, Vienna, Austria) to obtain 10 \u03bcm thickness sections. The adhesive film with sections attached was submerged for 60 s in 100% ethanol, then transferred to distilled water. The adhesive film prevents specimen shrinkage and detachment. This methodology allows for high quality anatomic preservation of the specimen and sectioning at a thickness of 0.5 \u03bcm. Sections were mounted with SCMM mounting medium (Section-Lab, Hiroshima, Japan) and imaged using a 1.4 N.A. objective. \n\nFluorescence immunohistochemistry for known SV cell-type markers was performed as follows. Mid-modiolar sections were washed in PBS then permeabilized and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) with 10% fetal bovine serum (A3840001, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Samples were then incubated in the appropriate primary antibodies in PBS-T with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by three rinses in PBS-T and labeling with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250, Life Technologies) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Where indicated, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:10,000, Life Technologies) was included with the secondary antibodies to detect nuclei. Organs were washed in PBS three times and mounted in SlowFade Gold (S36937, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher). Specimens were imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. Sections were mounted with SCEM tissue embedding medium (C-EM001, Section-Lab Co, Ltd.). Primary antibodies used included rabbit anti-KCNJ10 ( , Alomone Labs, APC-035, polyclonal, dilution 1:200), rabbit anti-CLDN11 ( , Life Technologies, 364500, polyclonal, dilution 1:200), goat anti-SLC12A2 ( , Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-21545, polyclonal, dilution 1:200), and Phalloidin AlexaFluor 647 ( , Invitrogen, A22287, dilution 1:250). \n\n\n### Endocochlear Potential Measurement \n  \nMethods for endocochlear potential (EP) measurement have been described ( ,  ) and have been previously performed by our group ( ;  ;  ). Here, adult CBA/J mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (T4842, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) at a dose of 0.35 mg/g body weight. EP measurements were made using glass microelectrodes inserted into the round window and through the basilar membrane of the first turn of the cochlea. Induction of anoxia, allowing measurement of anoxic-state EP, was accomplished by intramuscular injection of succinylcholine chloride (0.1 \u03bcg/g, NDC-0409-6629-02, Pfizer, New York, NY, United States) after establishment of deep anesthesia followed by additional injection of 2,2,2-Tribromoethanol (T4842, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Anoxic-state EP provides an indicator of the lowest EP and sensory hair cell function. In the presence of functional hair cells, the anoxic-state EP is negative, whereas the EP is zero if the hair cells are not functional. Data were recorded digitally (Digidata 1440A and AxoScope 10; Axon Instruments) and analyzed using Clampfit10 ( , Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, United States). For EP measurements, control (  n   = 12 mice) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 10 mice) mice were utilized with each mouse serving as a biological replicate. \n\n\n### Auditory Brainstem Response and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions \n  \nMethods have been previously described ( ). Briefly, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were measured in both ears for P30 control (  n   = 6) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6) CBA/J mice. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (56 mg/kg) and dexdomitor (0.375 mg/kg) and placed on a heating pad connected to a temperature controller (TC-2000, World Precision Instruments) inside a sound-attenuated booth (Acoustic Systems). The heating pad and thermometer placed under the mouse body were used to maintain body temperature near 37\u00b0C. Recordings were obtained using Tucker-Davis Technologies hardware (RZ6 Processor) and software (BioSigRZ, version 5.7.5). For ABR testing, subdermal needle electrodes (Rhythmlink) were placed at the vertex, under the test ear, and under the contralateral ear (ground). Blackman-gated tone burst stimuli (3 ms, 29.9/s, alternating polarity) were presented to the test ear at 8, 16, 32, and 40 kHz via a closed-field Tucker-Davis Technologies MF-1 speaker. Responses were amplified (20\u00d7), filtered (0.3\u20133 kHz), and digitized (25 kHz) with 512\u20131024 artifact-free responses per waveform. For each frequency, testing began at 80 dB SPL and decreased in 10 dB steps until the ABR waveform was no longer discernable. Once the response was lost, testing continued in 5 dB steps with a minimum of two waveforms per stimulus level to verify repeatability of ABR waves. ABR thresholds were determined by visual inspection of stacked waveforms for the lowest stimulus level that yielded repeatable waves. \n\nDistortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in both ears for P30 control (  n   = 6) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6) adult CBA/J mice using Tucker-Davis Technologies hardware (RZ6 Multi I/O processor, MF-1 speakers) and software (BioSigRz, version 5.7.5) in conjunction with an Etymotic ER-10B + microphone. Two tones were presented simultaneously at levels of f1 = 65 dB SPL and f2 = 55 dB SPL with the higher frequency tone (f2) set between 4-44.8 kHz (5 points per octave) and f2/f1 = 1.25. Mean noise floors were calculated from levels at six frequencies surrounding the 2f1-f2 DPOAE frequency. \n\n\n### Stria Vascularis Anatomical Assessment and TUNEL Assay \n  \nImageJ was utilized to calculate the cross-sectional area and thickness of the SV in mid-modiolar sections of both control (  n   = 5 mice) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6 mice) CBA/J mice at postnatal day 30 (P30) as previously described ( ;  ). Briefly, midmodiolar cross-sections of adult mouse cochleae were imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope at 40X magnification at each turn of the cochlea. Using phalloidin staining as an outline for the SV, the images for each apical, medial, and basal turn were measured for changes in total SV cross-sectional area (\u03bcm ), changes in SV thickness (\u03bcm) measured at the thickest point, and changes in the number of nuclei between control and experimental mice. \n\nTUNEL assay (Invitrogen, C10617) was performed per manufacturer provided protocol. Briefly, after washing with PBS, samples were incubated with a 1X Proteinase K in PBS solution for 15 min at room temperature and then washed again in PBS. The samples were then covered in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) reaction buffer and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The TdT reaction buffer was removed and replaced with a solution of TdT reaction buffer, EdUTP, and TdT enzyme and incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. The samples were rinsed in DI water and washed with a solution of 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with a solution of Click-iT  Plus TUNEL Supermix and 10X Click-iT  Plus TUNEL Reaction buffer additive and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, away from light. The samples were then washed in 3% BSA in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed in 1X PBS. Samples were then washed with PBST three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Phalloidin AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen, A22287, dilution 1:250) and DAPI diluted with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in PBST. Samples were then washed with PBST three times and mounted. \n\nTUNEL-positive nuclei were used as an indicator of apoptosis in cells. The apoptotic rate was calculated as the quotient of TUNEL-positive nuclei over the total number of nuclei labeled with DAPI, multiplied by 100, to calculate a percentage of total apoptotic cells within each turn. \n\n\n### Immunofluorescence Staining \n  \nControl (  n   = 5) and experimental (  n   = 6) adult CBA/J mice were given saline and 14 mg/kg cisplatin IP injections 24 h prior to sacrifice and dissection. To prepare samples for freezing, inner ears were dissected and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight. Ears were then placed in 0.25 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Next, they were placed in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by immersion in half 30% sucrose in PBS and super cryoembedding medium (SCEM, SECTION-LAB Co. Ltd.) for 2 h. Finally, they were placed in full SCEM for 2 h, frozen in a cryomold biopsy square, and sectioned onto slides using a cryostat. \n\nFor immunofluorescence staining, dried slides were placed on slide warmer for 15 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline with tween 20 (PBST) for 10 min. Samples were blocked with 10% FBS in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10% FBS in PBST and slides incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Samples were washed with PBST three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in PBST. Samples were then washed with PBST three times and mounted. Primary antibodies used included goat anti-SLC12A2 (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-21545, polyclonal, dilution 1:100), rabbit anti-KCNJ10 (Alomone Labs, APC-035, polyclonal, dilution 1:100), rabbit anti-CLDN11 (Life Technologies, 364500, polyclonal, dilution 1:100), and Phalloidin AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen, A22287, dilution 1:250). \n\n\n### Immunofluorescence Intensity Analysis of SV Cell Type-Specific Markers \n  \nImmunofluorescence intensity analysis was performed as previously described ( ;  ). Briefly, imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope at 40X magnification at each turn of the cochlea. After converting images to grayscale, fluorescence intensity quantification was performed in ImageJ by calculating the fluorescence intensity of the outlined region of the SV as previously described ( ). Fluorescence intensity was normalized by comparing the SV fluorescence intensity to that of a corresponding region in the scala media. Measurements for the upper (apical), middle, and lower (basal) turns of the cochlea were obtained. These measurements were obtained for known SV cell types including marginal cells (SLC12A2), intermediate cells (KCNJ10), and basal cells (CLDN11). KCNJ10 fluorescence intensity in the spiral ganglion neurons served as a control for immunofluorescence signal intensity measurements. Spiral ganglion fluorescence intensity was unchanged between cisplatin-treated and untreated mice with no statistically significant difference between fluorescence intensity measurements (data not shown). A two-way ANOVA comparison was used to measure statistical significance between conditions for each antibody. \n\n\n### Hair Cell Counts \n  \nCochlear whole mounts from P30 control (  n   = 6) and cisplatin-treated (  n   = 6) adult CBA/J mice were immuno-stained with anti-MYO7A antibody (Axxora, LLC) for hair cells and DAPI (Life Technologies) for cell nuclei. Organ of Corti sections were microdissected and mounted on slides. Inner and outer hair cell counts were performed from two 210 \u03bcm length regions from two cochlear turns (apical and basal) and the mean hair cell count was determined. \n\n\n### Digital Droplet qPCR (ddPCR) \n  \nControl (  n   = 4) and experimental (  n   = 4) adult (P30) CBA/J mice were given a single IP injection of saline or 14 mg/kg cisplatin, respectively, and sacrificed after 24 h. To prepare samples for ddPCR, inner ears were dissected in PBST over ice and SV tissue carefully removed to avoid including unwanted cell types. RNA was retrieved using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit and converted to cDNA. TaqMan probes of 17 genes of interest were designed and ordered from Applied Biosystems. Three 96-well plates were prepared to include samples from four control and four experimental mice in triplicate. PCR was done in a 20 \u03bcL total volume of 10 \u03bcL Bio-Rad ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP), 1 \u03bcL probe of gene of interest, 1 \u03bcL reference gene Actb, 1 \u03bcL diluted cDNA, and 7 \u03bcL molecular grade water. The ddPCR Droplets were generated using the QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital. PCR was performed as described in the QX200 ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix instructions. Droplets were read with a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) and analyzed with QuantaSoft software (BioRad). Primer sequences utilized for ddPCR are provided in the supplement ( ). \n\n\n### Single Cell RNA-Seq \n  \nA group of P30 CBA/J mice (  n   = 6, three female, three male) were given a single IP injection of 14 mg/kg cisplatin and sacrificed after 24 h. SV from these mice were micro-dissected as previously described ( ) and utilized to generate single cell transcriptomes. To prepare samples for scRNA-Seq, inner ears were dissected in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) over ice and SV tissue carefully removed to avoid including unwanted cell types. SV tissue was then placed in a tube containing 200 \u03bcL DMEM. 10 \u03bcL trypsin was added to the tube and incubated for 7 min at 37\u00b0C. After incubation 150 \u03bcL liquid was removed and replaced with 150 \u03bcL 10% FBS in DMEM. The tissue was triturated for 2 min to dissociate single cells and then passed through a 20 \u03bcm filter. Two \u03bcL of supernatant was removed, leaving a 100 \u03bcL final volume. The concentration was then measured using a cell counter and the final concentration used to determine the volume to be placed in the well of a 10 \u00d7 8-channel microfluidics chip. Within this chip droplets were created that each contained a single cell and single uniquely barcoded bead. The cells were then lysed, and RT performed to convert mRNA to cDNA. Single cell libraries were prepared, and the results sequenced on an Illumina sequencer. The details regarding scRNA-Seq workflow are as described in  . After scRNA-Seq protocol and library prep, the resultant sparse matrix was imported into R and clustered using the Seurat package. \n\n\n### Seurat Clustering \n  \nFollowing Illumina sequencing of the scRNA-Seq results, three files were created: a list of individually barcoded cells, a list of gene symbols with their Ensembl IDs, and a sparse matrix of the read counts of each gene in each cell. These files were then imported into R and converted to a dgTMatrix; a form suitable for analysis using the Seurat package in R. A total of 2,681 cells were captured in the experiment, with 2,236 cells used in the final analysis following filters to minimize doublets and debris. The median number of genes identified per cell was 1,312, while the median number of reads per cell was 3,669. The clusters created by the Seurat package were identified and labeled using published markers of cell types within the SV and lateral wall of the murine cochlea. The methods behind Seurat clustering and differential expression have been previously described ( ). \n\n\n### Comparison of Cisplatin-Treated SV Single-Cells Transcriptomes to Untreated Adult SV Single Cell Transcriptomes \n  \nCisplatin-treated adult SV single-cell transcriptomes were compared to a previously published dataset consisting of unperturbed adult SV single-cell transcriptomes ( ) (GEO Accession ID:  ; see footnote 2). The two datasets were combined using the   MergeSeurat   function and normalized after the merge. Cellular identities were carried over from the individual Seurat clustering as discussed in the previous section. Differential expression analysis was performed using the   FindAllMarkers   function in Seurat ( ) and the DEsingle package ( ). DESingle is a differential expression package that utilizes raw reads from single cell experiments and performs its own normalization and batch correction. The results of the differential expression analyses were visualized using the EnhancedVolcano package ( ) in R. \n\n\n### Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference \n  \nSingle-cell regulatory network inference (SCENIC) and clustering analysis was performed on the post-Seurat analysis object using the methods described initially by   and applied to the analysis of single cell transcriptomes of the adult SV ( ). Cisplatin-treated SV cells analyzed in the SCENIC pipeline were given identities based on clustering analysis from Seurat to allow for   post hoc   identification of cell types. Briefly, cell type-specific regulons were identified in cisplatin-treated adult SV, regulon activity was quantified, and a regulon activity matrix was constructed to identify cisplatin-treated cell states. Expression of the genes within these regulons was then compared against the genes demonstrating differential expression between cisplatin-treated and control SV single cell transcriptomes obtained by using DESingle ( ). \n\n\n### Identification of Potentially Druggable Gene Targets \n  \nTo identify druggable targets within this list of differentially expressed cell type-specific regulon genes, Pharos (see footnote 1) was utilized as previously described ( ). Briefly, Pharos is a web interface for the Target Central Resource Database (TCRD) created by the \u201cIlluminating the Druggable Genome\u201d program, which collates known drug-protein interactions, including both FDA-approved drugs and small molecules ( ). Pharos categorizes each protein with a \u201ctarget developmental level\u201d according to how much is known on its \u201cdruggability\u201d ( ). Targets are classified according to available knowledge: (1) Tclin, where there is known interaction with FDA approved drugs, (2) Tchem, where genes have known and unknown interactions with ligands, (3) Tbio, where genes have a known function but no known interactions, and (4) Tdark, where there is very little known either about function or interaction. To focus on the most clinically relevant targets, we identified Tclin and Tchem genes that were differentially expressed between control and cisplatin-treated scRNA-Seq datasets that were also present in the cell-type specific regulons identified by the SCENIC program. The goal was to identify possible drug interventions in genes and regulatory networks known to be involved in the maintenance of the EP that were also either up or down regulated in the presence of cisplatin. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nFor pairwise comparisons between control and cisplatin-treated CBA/J mice, an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s   t  -test was used. Comparisons of multiple assays across the same tissue were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction with a false discovery rate (FDR or   q   value) of 5%. Two-way ANOVA and Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test were used for comparisons between control and cisplatin-treated mice involving cochlear turns. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (  GraphPad) for PC. For measurements of strial thickness, cross-sectional area and fluorescent intensity, all values are means \u00b1 standard deviations (SD). Both males and females were tested, and there was no evidence of a significant effect of sex on any measures. Therefore, the data displayed in all graphs are from males and females combined. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll data generated in these studies have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE165662) and can be found on GEO at:  .

Little research has explored community-level influences on cigar smoking in this population, especially concerning product-specific influences and cigar smokers\u2019 perceptions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 Black young adult (ages 21\u201329) cigar smokers in the Washington, D.C. area and analyzed themes regarding physical and sociocultural community-level factors perceived to influence cigar use. Themes were further analyzed based on participants\u2019 predominant cigar products (cigarillos, large cigars, blunts). Participants reported easy access to affordable cigarillos, widespread cigarillo sales and targeted marketing, norms of cigar and blunt smoking for stress relief, socialization, and cultural participation, and ubiquitous cigar and blunt smoking cues, all of which promoted cigar use in their communities. Future research should further explore how community-level influences contribute to disproportionate cigar use among Black young adults. Our findings suggest that programs and policies addressing physical and sociocultural community-level pro-smoking influences may help mitigate cigar smoking disparities. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nUse of cigar products (including large cigars, cigarillos, and filtered cigars) remains a significant public health and health disparities issue in the U.S. Unlike cigarette consumption, which has substantially declined in past decades, annual consumption of cigar products doubled from 2000 to 2012 (6\u221212 billion sticks) [ ]. Racial/ethnic minority groups, especially Black/African American populations, are also more likely to smoke cigar products than White populations [ , ]. For example, in 2015\u20132016, Black adults were about 2.3 times, 2.7 times, and 2.0 times more likely than White adults to have smoked cigar products in the past 30 days, to smoke cigar products every day, and to smoke cigar products \u201cfairly regularly,\u201d respectively [ ]. \n\nAdditionally, Black young adults (ages 18\u201330) in the U.S. have the highest little cigar/cigarillo smoking prevalence (2.7%) of any age-racial/ethnic group [ ]. The prevalence of all cigar product smoking was 1.5\u20133 times higher among Black young adults compared to those of other races, with greater disparities of 3\u20135 times in little cigar/cigarillo smoking prevalence [ ]. Compared to White cigar product smokers, Black smokers also have about 2.3-times greater odds of smoking blunts [ ], defined as cigar products in which some or all of the tobacco has been hollowed out and replaced with cannabis, within the past 12 months. \n\nThe disproportionately high use of cigar products among Black populations, especially Black young adults, may contribute to health disparities experienced by these populations. Research has shown that cigar product smoking may carry many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking [ ], and that large cigars and cigarillos can contain higher concentrations of nicotine and carcinogens than cigarettes [ , ]. These studies also suggest that cigar product smoking, even among those who have never smoked cigarettes or those reporting no inhalation, is associated with negative health consequences, including lung cancer, oral cancer, other morbidities, and mortality [ , , ]. Additionally, blunt smoking, an addictive substance use behavior, is associated with increased cannabis use [ ], dependence on both tobacco and cannabis products [ ], and risks of carbon monoxide exposure compared to tobacco-free cannabis use [ ]. \n\nGiven the health risks from cigar and blunt smoking and its potential impact on tobacco-related health disparities, understanding the risk factors that influence cigar product smoking among Black young adults is critical. This information can be used to inform public health programs and policies aimed at reducing cigar product smoking and related health disparities in this population. Previous research on factors associated with cigar product smoking among Black populations has several limitations. First, most of these studies investigated individual (e.g., knowledge and harm perceptions) and interpersonal level (e.g., family/peer use) risk factors rather than community-level influences [ , , , ]. Socio-ecological models provide a framework for investigating multiple levels of influence, including community-level influences\u2014shared physical and sociocultural factors that can shape health and behavior among a group of people [ ]. Applying a health equity lens to socio-ecological models, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework posits that racial and ethnic health disparities related to a risky health behavior may be explained at various levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal) across a wide domain of factors (biological, behavioral, physical environment, sociocultural environment, and healthcare system) [ ]. Physical environment influences may involve personal, household, school/work, and community environments and resources; sociocultural environment influences may involve family/peer and community norms and interpersonal and local structural discrimination [ ]. Here, we expand on existing research by focusing on the impact of physical and sociocultural environmental factors at the community level. \n\nSecond, the studies that focused on community-level risk factors mainly examined the differing presence and density of cigar retailers in the neighborhood and the advertising appearing in these retailers across various racial/ethnic and/or age groups rather than focusing on Black young adults specifically [ , , , ]. Our qualitative study includes other types of community-level influences within a narrower population and adds the opportunity to explore how Black young adult cigar product smokers may perceive the connections between various community-level factors and their cigar product smoking behavior. Finally, these previous studies often examined one type of cigar product (e.g., cigarillos) or grouped all cigar products together, and did not separate blunt smoking from cigar smoking behavior. We expand on this work using product-specific interview prompts and distinct blunt use questions to specify particular influences of concern and identify potential differences by product type. \n\nTherefore, in order to understand the various potential community-level influences on cigar product smoking behavior among Black young adults, we explored the physical and sociocultural contexts of Black young adults\u2019 cigar product smoking behaviors in their communities. Specifically, through in-depth interviews with Black young adult cigar product users, we aimed to characterize social and environmental influences on different cigar products and blunt smoking with a focus on community-level influences. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants and Study Procedures \n  \nWe conducted in-depth phone interviews with 40 non-Hispanic Black young adult cigar product smokers from May to June 2020. Participants were recruited by the research team through social media sites (Instagram, Facebook, and Craigslist), predominantly targeting participants residing in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Individuals were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or African American; (2) 21 to 29 years old; (3) a current cigar product smoker (defined as smoking large cigars, cigarillos, or filtered cigars \u22654 times in the last 2 weeks) [ , ]; and (4) able to read and speak English. Research team members screened interested individuals over the phone. Current cigar product smoking status was confirmed during the screening by asking potential participants to describe the characteristics and brands of the products they currently smoked. The research staff who screened the participants were trained to recognize cigar product brands and types. Eligible participants then received an email containing a link to an online survey that included a consent form and a brief questionnaire. Participants provided informed consent prior to completing the questionnaire and answered questions on socio-demographic characteristics and tobacco use behavior. Participants were scheduled for phone interviews following their survey completion. Those who completed both the survey and phone interview received a $100 Amazon gift card. The study was approved by the National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board (project #P204893). \n\n\n### 2.2. Interview Instrument and Structure \n  \nA senior researcher trained in qualitative data collection conducted all in-depth interviews. The in-depth interview is an established qualitative research tool used to explore participant perspectives and their contexts [ ]. Participants were first asked to describe the brands and characteristics (including cigar product type and flavors) of the cigar products and cigar smoking patterns (e.g., frequencies) they currently smoked. Participants were also asked to describe their current blunt smoking behavior after the interviewer defined blunt products to them and assured them that the information would be kept confidential. They were then asked by the interviewer to describe the context and environment relevant to cigar product smoking (purchasing and accessing cigar products in the community; exposure to cigar product marketing; cigar product smoking triggers; perceived community influences on cigar product smoking). Interviews also included questions related to quitting cigar product smoking and the perceived influence of cigar product policies. Participants who indicated that they smoked blunts were also asked about their blunt smoking behavior and its contexts. Additionally, participants mentioning cannabis use as part of their smoking culture or environmental context were probed to describe this element further. The interviews lasted between 45 and 60 min. Notes were taken by the moderator during the interviews, and data saturation was reached after interview #30 for overall content. Ten more interviews were conducted to gather additional data for allowing thematic analysis by various types of cigar products. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Analysis and Reporting \n  \nPhone interviews were audio-recorded upon participant consent and later transcribed verbatim. De-identified transcripts were analyzed on Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, Manhattan Beach, CA, USA), a web-based qualitative data management application. The coders used thematic analysis to organize and analyze the interview data [ , ]. Four study team members initially developed the codebook based on the interview guide and identified themes and subthemes from reviewing the data relevant to the overarching research questions. \n\nThree coders underwent training to familiarize themselves with the codebook, then applied the codes to all transcripts independently. All interview codes related to cigar product use, access, and perceptions were further classified by product type (large cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, and blunts). Each transcript was independently coded by two coders who later reconciled any coding disagreements in discussion with the research team. The percentage agreement of the codes used for this analysis was moderate to high (81\u201395%), demonstrating satisfactory inter-coder reliability [ ]. Finally, coded content was categorized, counted, and analyzed for themes and subthemes arising from the data by two researchers independently.   describes the codes and their definitions included in the codebook for thematic analysis. \n\nIn accordance with prior thematic analyses, the estimated frequency of participants reporting themes and subthemes was recorded and reported as \u201call\u201d (100%), \u201cmost\u201d (70\u201399%), \u201cmore than half\u201d (51\u201369%), \u201csome\u201d (20\u201350%), and \u201ca few\u201d (1\u201319%) [ , ]. Representative quotes, along with the age and sex of the quoted participant, were reported for each theme. Due to the limited amount of interview data specific to filtered cigar smoking, themes specific to filtered cigars were not generated or reported. In addition, participants\u2019 socio-demographic characteristics and tobacco use histories were quantitatively analyzed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Participant Characteristics \n  \nThe average age of participants in the sample was 26 years old, and slightly more than half of the participants were female (  n   = 23) ( ). Past 30-day smoking of cigarillos, large cigars, blunts, and filtered cigars was reported by 36 (90.0%), 24 (60.0%), 23 (57.5%), and 7 (17.5%) participants, respectively. Eighteen (45.0%) participants reported blunts as their most frequently smoked cigar product in the past 30 days, followed by cigarillos (  n   = 16, 40.0%), large cigars (  n   = 4, 10.0%), and filtered cigars (  n   = 2, 5.0%). Additionally, past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and hookah was reported by 23 (57.5%), 26 (65.0%), and 27 (67.5%) of participants, respectively. \n\n\n### 3.2. Sales of Cigar Products in the Community \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Convenient Retailers with Abundant Cigarillo Selections \n  \nWhen asked where participants usually access their cigar products, most participants who regularly smoked cigarillos mentioned that they accessed cigarillos through retailers such as gas stations and corner stores in the communities they live in. More than half of the participants also explicitly mentioned that almost all retailers in the neighborhood sell cigarillos. These participants noted that gas stations and convenience stores where cigarillos are sold are abundant and easily accessible in their communities. When asked whether it was easy to find the cigar products that they currently smoked, most participants who regularly smoked cigarillos responded that it was extremely easy, and there was ample access to their preferred cigarillo brands and flavors. \n \n \u201cIt would be weird for a gas station to not have cigarillos or cigarettes.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cYou can buy them at any gas station, or anything like that.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cI choose them [gas stations] because they\u2019re reliable and they\u2019re really the most convenient. I can count on being able to buy them for the most part when I go into a store.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cBlack & Milds, I purchase those everywhere; the gas station. Any gas station you could think of.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.2.2. Specialty Sources for Large Cigars \n  \nSome participants who frequently smoked large cigars mentioned that they purchased large cigars from gourmet cigar shops or cigar lounges located in their neighborhood. A few mentioned that sometimes they had to travel to nearby neighborhoods or towns to purchase large cigars. Some of the participants who frequently smoked both large cigars and cigarillos found that it was much easier to find cigarillo products they frequently smoked than large cigars. \n \n \u201c[Large] cigars, I go to the regular cigar stores, the specialty cigar stores. They have them in even some convenience stores. With the cigarillos, I can pretty much get those anywhere. The gas station, any little small corner store or Wawa, 7-Eleven. Anything like that.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll just go and pop into a 7-Eleven or gas station for cigarillos, but for the [large] cigars I\u2019ll go to David\u2019s Cigars\u2026If it\u2019s a cigar lounge, they\u2019ll roll them for you, cut it, put it in a humidor.\u201d  \n \n\n\n### 3.3. Marketing of Cigars at Community Locations, Social Media, and Events \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Cigarillo Advertising Concentrated in and around Retailers \n  \nWhen asked whether they had seen any cigar product-related marketing and promotions recently, most participants reported that they often saw cigarillo advertisements at local retailers and other community fixtures such as windows, storefronts, and light poles. Product posters and displays located at retailers, visible both outside and inside of the store, were the most commonly described types of advertisements. \n \n \u201cIn the store, gas stations, outside of the gas stations on the window, and on the corner store window. They promote them everywhere. On the light poles. Wherever they know people will see them, they\u2019re visible to the public.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere. It may be as simple as an ad right there on the front of the door before you enter a Shell gas station, or maybe an ad on the window at 7-Eleven.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cYes, there are a lot of billboards. There are a lot of billboards around the neighborhood and stickers and pictures and sale pictures of the wraps and stuff, like two for $1.99 or three for $4.99.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIt was placed more in front of the store versus in the back part where the rest of the other products usually are. It was more towards the front, so they were actually showing that these are new brands and flavors that came out if you wanted to try it.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.3.2. Advertising Appeal through Flavors and Discounts \n  \nWhen further asked what specific content or messages they saw, more than half of the participants who recalled cigar product advertisements reported that the materials that caught their attention were often promoting new brands and flavors and/or those that featured price promotions such as coupons, discounts, and savings. When asked what they thought about those advertising messages, some reported that they would like to be informed of the new products and flavors entering the market as well as the discounts. A few explicitly mentioned the advertisements that introduced new flavors prompted them to purchase and try the flavors. \n \n \u201cI like the way they show the different types of flavors that they have, the different types of brands that you can get. The displays say a lot as far as the brands and the flavors or new flavors that come out.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIt might be a sign saying like they sell this particular brand or they have these flavors.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cActually, after the ad it made me feel as though I wanted it, it looked cool. I\u2019d never tried that before, so it gave me a sense of wanting to try it.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.3.3. Social Media and Event-Based Advertising \n  \nA few participants mentioned that they followed cigarillo brands (e.g., Backwoods and Swisher accounts) and/or brand ambassadors and influencers on social media and participated in official brand email subscriptions for price discounts and notifications about new flavors. A few also reported they had attended entertainment activities (e.g., concerts and festivals) that were sponsored by cigarillo companies; during these events, they met brand ambassadors who introduced them to new products and flavors and handed out free products for trial. Additionally, one participant mentioned that she had encountered salespeople giving away free cigarillo products in her neighborhood. \n \n \u201cI follow a lot of different brands on social media, so I\u2019ll see ads on social media; or I will get newsletters in my emails; or they might have marketing events where they have a sales rep or different things like that.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s cigar videos, I\u2019d say, because I follow certain companies that make cigars. Instagram videos, basically, about new ones that come out.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cYou can be on Instagram and an ad will pop-up about Black & Milds. If you\u2019ve typed it in your phone before, if you\u2019ve done anything. Like me I look at cigar videos, I look up different types of things so it may pop-up on my Google.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cAnd then one time they had the girls, they call the Swisher Sweet Girls, that were doing a sampling, a promo sampling\u2026 That\u2019s another way that you can try it, they\u2019re very affordable.\u201d  \n \n\n\n### 3.4. Community Norm of Smoking Cigars and Blunts \n  \n#### 3.4.1. Normalized Cigarillo and Blunt Use \n  \nWhen asked to share their perceptions of cigar product smoking culture in their communities, most participants reported widespread community acceptance and norms of smoking cigarillos and blunts. More than half of participants reported that most of the people they knew living in the community smoked cigar products, blunts or other tobacco products. Some also mentioned that when they grew up, they were told by family and community members that cigarillos and blunts are not as harmful to someone\u2019s health as cigarettes. \n \n \u201cBlack and Milds, cigarettes, blunts, everything. You name it, they\u2019re smoking it around here.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cThe people here where I live right now, they\u2019ll smoke blunts outside during the day. They don\u2019t care. That message kind of makes you think, \u2018Hey, this is normal.\u2019 I kind of feel that way. Even though I really know it\u2019s not normal, it seems that way and eventually, you believe it.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cEverybody that I live with smokes. All of my good friends, they all smoke. We probably use the same brand of stuff. My family smokes. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just everybody around me smokes.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.4.2. Cigarillo and Blunt Use Norms Driven by Community and Personal Stress \n  \nSome participants discussed cigarillo and blunt smoking as a response to stress. Specifically, they reported that people from their communities were constantly stressed out, and those who smoked cigarillos and blunts were perceived to smoke to relieve stress. Many of these participants explicitly tied this stress to financial hardship and/or work. \n \n \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest reason why most people in my community smoke it, is because it\u2019s the safest way to escape. I think that\u2019s what any drug is, an escape\u2026 I can only guess some people may need to escape from their situation because they live in poverty and they don\u2019t want to think about it or they have so many people that they need to take care of and it stresses them.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cWell- I feel as though it makes me feel like they are stressing too, so that\u2019s why they smoke too.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cYes, stress. Stress makes me want to smoke. Everybody stresses. I stress almost every day, so that\u2019s the main reason. \u2026 I don\u2019t have a job. I don\u2019t have any money and I have an eight-year-old with no income.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.4.3. Social Reasons for Cigar Use \n  \nSome described that it is common for cigarillo smokers in their community to discuss, collect, and try a variety of cigarillo products. Some participants mentioned that cigar lounges located in their communities served as community gathering places for people to relax and socialize; a few further discussed the experience of becoming close friends with other cigar smokers they met at the lounges and smoking large cigars as a way to bond with each other. \n \n \u201cBeing around my sister and being around this community that I recently moved to, and people smoke cigars, they taught me about cigars. They taught me about the different types of tobacco, taught me about the different ways that the cigars are rolled, and I started getting into it because it\u2019s fascinating to me, for one\u2026 Basically, it was a community of people around me that got me into it.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cI think the smoking cigars in the neighborhood, a lot of people have expressed interest. They got started with, \u2018I heard jazz music coming from this place and want to go in and check it out, and this guy was doing something with his cigar so I wanted to try one and I want to learn more about it.\u2019\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.4.4. Cigarillos, Blunts, and Cannabis in Black Hip-Hop Culture \n  \nA few participants explicitly associated cigar product and blunt smoking with Black hip-hop culture or Black cannabis culture. Some of those connected the culture closely with a few cigarillo brands that are normatively smoked as blunts (e.g., Backwoods), identifying artist-product associations and the resulting behavioral norms as elements of cultural knowledge. \n \n \u201cThe closest I will say about seeing endorsement for it are through celebrities or stuff like that. Celebrities who are known to smoke like Wiz Khalifa or Snoop Dogg who have their own brands and they promote different brands.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIf an artist has an endorsement with Swisher Sweets, he\u2019ll have a post showing a painting of the different flavors.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cJust, for example, basically just the hip-hop Black culture. I guess the smoking weed culture, the smoking weed constituents, that type of scenario. Wiz Khalifa, he raps. Rappers, they say, \u2018We smoke Backwoods.\u2019\u201d  \n  \n \u201cKeep smoking the blunt. Nobody\u2019s smoking white papers. Especially Black boys. That\u2019s what Tupac said.\u201d  \n \n\n\n### 3.5. Ubiquitous Cigar and Blunt Use Cues in the Community \n  \n#### 3.5.1. Smoking Cues and Signs of Use \n  \nWhen discussing cigar product smoking in their neighborhood or community, most participants also reported ubiquitous cigarillo and blunt smoking and smoking cues in the neighborhood. Frequently reported signs of cigar product and blunt smoking included wrappers, tips, litters, and smells of burning tobacco and cannabis in the neighborhood. Some participants also reported seeing others rolling up blunts on the street and congregating outside of certain community places (e.g., public parks) to smoke cigar products and blunts. \n \n \u201cThere are wrappers and cigarillo wrappers laying around everywhere: on the street, on the sidewalk, on the grass, in people\u2019s yards, on people\u2019s cars, on the roof. You might see a pack of Grabba Leaf on the roof. They roll in the streets, in the neighborhood.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cWeed has a smell. Sometimes when I walk out of my apartment my hallways, my floor will smell like weed. Even if I\u2019m outside sometimes I can smell the smell of weed. People will literally walk down the street smoking.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cYes, or in the house, on the porch. There are tons of balconies and you can smell it. If I were to take a walk around my neighborhood right now, I would pass three houses where I could smell weed or even see people smoking on the porch.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of people walking up and down the street and you see\u2026Sometimes I can see them, some of them are my neighbors so they\u2019re on the neighboring patios and they\u2019ll sit outside on their patios and smoke.\u201d  \n \n\n#### 3.5.2. Pervasive Cues Promote Continued Smoking \n  \nA few participants indicated that these signs of smoking cues commonly found in the neighborhood made them crave smoking cigar products and/or experience difficulties in quitting those products. A few participants also reported smoking cigar products and blunts to conform to smoking norms or perceived peer pressure. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s just so much smoking going on. That\u2019s what got me into smoking\u2026People who don\u2019t have a strong willpower could be subjected to smoking more than what they want.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cI guess there\u2019s a certain element of just wanting to share in the same activity as your friends as well that makes you want to do it. Or if someone else is smoking and you\u2019re in the same space, it\u2019s just easy to say, \u2018Hey, can I take a puff or two?\u2019\u201d  \n  \n \u201cBut I try to stay away from other smokers because like I said, I\u2019m trying to cut down. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me too.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a trigger because if I see somebody have one I\u2019m like, \u2018I want to have one.\u2019\u2026 I\u2019ll be like, \u2018I need to have one too.\u2019 It\u2019s a trigger. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d  \n  \n \u201cUsually, when they\u2019re in party mode they like to pull out their blunts and cigars. When I see them do it, then I\u2019ll go ahead and join in because I don\u2019t want to be ridiculed by them for not doing it.\u201d  \n \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThemes from in-depth interviews with Black young adult cigar smokers indicated that this group faces community-level pro-cigar-smoking influences in their physical and sociocultural environments. Black young adult cigar smokers reported easy access to affordable products, especially cigarillos, in stores throughout their neighborhoods. They described frequent exposure to cigar product advertising not only on storefronts and point-of-sale displays but also on social media and at events, with many participants finding cigar product discounts and flavor promotions especially appealing. Cigar product and blunt use were highly accepted and normalized in Black young adults\u2019 communities, often providing a means for socialization as well as stress relief among community members facing economic strain. For some Black young adults, cigar product and blunt smoking norms were also connected to hip-hop culture. The ubiquity of cigar product and blunt smoking in participants\u2019 communities yielded a plethora of pro-smoking cues that could promote continued use and hinder attempts at avoidance and cessation. \n\nParticipants\u2019 emphasis on the ubiquity and affordability of cigar products, especially cigarillos, at local retailers highlights a distinct community-level facilitator of use. These findings are consistent with prior quantitative spatial analyses, which demonstrate stark neighborhood-level disparities in little cigar/cigarillo availability. For example, one study in Washington, D.C., found that the odds of little cigar/cigarillo availability were more than ten times greater at stores in neighborhoods with a high proportion of Black residents [ ]. Accordingly, policies targeting product availability\u2014for example, restricting the sale of single cigarillos\u2014may be of interest in reducing cigar product use in those communities [ ]. \n\nOur results show that consistent reports of widespread cigar marketing may serve as an important community-level influence among Black young adult cigar smokers. Studies have shown that tobacco marketing exposure may contribute to tobacco use among youth and young adults [ , , ]. Most participants recalled seeing cigar advertisements throughout their communities, exposing them constantly to a risk factor for cigar use on a community level in their daily lives. Prior studies also indicate that cigar marketing is disproportionately targeted to neighborhoods with larger Black populations, lower incomes, and more young adults [ , , , ]. Therefore, our results and the past research suggest a need for placing advertising and marketing restrictions in high-risk communities to reduce these pro-cigar-smoking influences that are disparately experienced by Black young adult communities. For example, policies prohibiting cigar advertisements at the point of sale, which have shown promise in other countries, including Australia and Canada [ , ], may reduce Black and poor young adults\u2019 disparate exposure to a pro-cigar-smoking influence. Additionally, existing national and local policies [ ] that prohibit billboard marketing and brand sponsorships by cigarette companies should be expanded to explicitly cover cigar marketing. \n\nNotably, our study participants\u2019 emphasis on flavor-related content as a frequent and appealing advertising element is of health equity concern, given evidence that the tobacco industry has used flavored cigarillos and little cigars and their marketing to target young and Black audiences [ , , ]. Accordingly, a recent U.S. FDA proposal to restrict the sale of flavored cigar products is a welcome development that could reduce Black young adults\u2019 disproportionate exposure to flavored cigar product sales and marketing [ ]. As new marketing strategies like social media advertising and brand ambassadors take hold among the same groups targeted by physical marketing in their communities, policies restricting the advertising of cigar products are another tool to combat smoking cues and disparities at a community level. \n\nParticipants also mentioned pervasive cigar product placements surrounding popular rappers and hip-hop artists. Sponsorships of artists and events have been a consistent element of the tobacco industry\u2019s decades-long efforts to target Black young adults, often with specific products [ , ]. Modern cigarillo manufacturers\u2019 forays into the hip-hop industry, such as the Backwoods promotions, rap battle sponsorships by the Al Capone brand, and the ongoing Swisher Sweets Artist Project, are reminiscent of earlier menthol cigarette marketing campaigns that targeted young Black males in the jazz and hip-hop scenes [ , , ]. Black young adults connected community norms of cigar product and blunt smoking to industry-manufactured associations of these products with rap and hip-hop artists, lending further support to calls for regulation of cigar companies\u2019 music industry sponsorships on the grounds of targeting young, Black populations. \n\nIn describing the widespread normalization of cigar product and blunt smoking in their communities, many participants also connected the behavior to stress that they perceived to be shared among many community members. Notably, prior research indicates that observed stress among others can increase one\u2019s own stress [ ], an observation that aligns with community development theorists\u2019 suggestion that community conditions impact well-being across concentric individual, social, and ecological levels [ ]. The compounding of societal stressors is thought to occur at both the individual and community levels [ ], which could contribute to disparate vulnerabilities to tobacco use in pursuit of stress relief. Economic hardship, mentioned by several participants in our study, may represent a stressor faced disproportionately by the communities of Black young adults given their higher rates of poverty and lower median incomes compared to other racial and age groups [ ]. Prior research has suggested that subjective socioeconomic status, as measured by self-reported financial difficulties, may contribute to cigarette smoking among Black adults [ ]; further investigation is warranted to determine whether this association holds for cigar product use among Black young adults. More research is also needed to explore the potential associations between other stressors and cigar product use and should focus on those stressors that are likely to impact disadvantaged and industry-targeted groups like Black young adults. For example, self-reported racial discrimination has been linked to higher odds of use for both tobacco and cannabis among Black adults [ , ]. More research is needed to determine the role of financial and racial stresses in the etiology and exacerbation of cigar product smoking, specifically among Black communities. Our findings also demonstrate a need for effective programs to promote healthier coping behaviors within communities that experience chronic, excessive stress. \n\nFurthermore, Black young adults in our sample described a variety of social and environmental cues (e.g., seeing other people smoking and rolling up blunts, seeing cigar product wrappers and tips, and smelling burning tobacco and cannabis) that could trigger cigar product smoking and hinder cessation. Exposure to tobacco use in the social, physical, and symbolic environments can serve as significant sources of normative influence to promote tobacco use [ ]. Previous research suggests that social and physical environments (e.g., on social occasions or in stressful situations) may trigger behaviors like flavored cigar use [ ] and cigar-cigarette dual use [ ]. As some participants noted, social and environmental cues that trigger cigar smoking can act as a promoter of continued use and a barrier to cessation. Consistently, a previous analysis found that barriers to cigar smoking cessation among Black young adults included widespread cigar-smoking cues, easy availability of cigar products, and persistent stressors [ ]. Since Black individuals and communities are disproportionately burdened by cigar smoking and exposed to triggers for smoking these products, more research and resources should be directed toward these communities for cigar product cessation specifically. Neighborhood-based smoking cessation interventions [ ] are a viable way to deliver targeted cessation resources to vulnerable communities but have historically focused on cigarette smoking cessation. Additionally, the low harm perceptions and normalization of cigar product use reported by many study participants suggest that culturally appropriate education initiatives are needed to combat these pro-cigar-smoking influences. Future research that investigates the harm and cost of cigar and blunt smoking to individuals\u2019 communities may further help inform the messages and programs aimed at reducing the use of those products in the communities. \n\nOur study results should be considered with the following limitations. First, our data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which participants might have experienced a higher level of stress than usual [ ]. The results related to the perceived community stress and reasons for smoking cigarillos might differ if data were collected pre-pandemic. Second, this study did not directly explore societal-level influences (e.g., racism, gentrification, police brutality) on cigar product and blunt smoking among Black young adults. Given the participant discussions of community stress and the frequent linkage of cigar product and blunt use to stress relief, the potential impact of these stressors is a critical topic for further research. Third, our exploration of blunt use was limited by the omission of questions regarding cannabis acquisition; cannabis availability and acquisition norms may be additional community-level factors with the potential to influence cigar product and blunt smoking behavior. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThrough in-depth interviews, Black young adult cigar product smokers described cigar and blunt smoking as ubiquitous and normative in their communities. Targeted multimodal advertising, socioeconomic strain, easy access to cigar products, and influential cigar product smoking cues perceived in participants\u2019 communities can encourage cigar product and blunt smoking and hinder cessation among Black young adults. Interventions targeting pro-cigar-smoking influences at the community level may be a valuable tool in combatting tobacco-related health disparities. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9025611, "text_md5": "505d5332e7de1fd488fbcf9143ec25ad", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 157], "journal": [158, 189], "publication_year": [191, 195], "title": [206, 338], "keywords": [352, 472], "abstract": [485, 1716], "body": [1725, 38313]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35457307, "doi": "10.3390/ijerph19084430", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9025611", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9025611"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9025611\">9025611</a>", "list_title": "PMC9025611  Physical and Sociocultural Community-Level Influences on Cigar Smoking among Black Young Adults: An In-Depth Interview Investigation"}

Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA  pairs are ideal for genetic code expansion and have been extensively engineered for developing mutually orthogonal pairs. Here, we identify two novel wild-type PylRS/tRNA  pairs simultaneously present in the deep-rooted extremely halophilic euryarchaeal methanogen   Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1, and show that both pairs are functional in the model halophilic archaeon   Haloferax volcanii  . These pairs consist of two different PylRS enzymes and two distinct tRNAs with dissimilar discriminator bases. Surprisingly, these two PylRS/tRNA  pairs display mutual orthogonality enabled by two unique features, the A73 discriminator base of tRNA 2 and a shorter motif 2 loop in PylRS2.   In vivo   translation experiments show that tRNA 2 charging by PylRS2 is defined by the enzyme's shortened motif\u00a02 loop. Finally, we demonstrate that the two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs can simultaneously decode UAG and UAA codons for incorporation of two distinct noncanonical amino acids into protein. This example of a single base change in a tRNA leading to additional coding capacity suggests that the growth of the genetic code is not yet limited by the number of identity elements fitting into the tRNA structure. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAccurate translation of the genetic code depends on several molecular determinants in a tRNA species (identity elements) that are responsible for the recognition by the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) leading to correct aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) formation ( ). One important tRNA identity element, the 4  nucleotide from the 3\u2032-end was recognized early on ( ) and named the discriminator base; in combination with several other nucleotides/identity elements (mainly in the anticodon and the acceptor helix), it is involved in providing acylation accuracy for at least eighteen aaRSs ( ). \n\nPyrrolysine (Pyl) is the 22  genetically encoded amino acid found in many archaea and certain bacteria ( ). Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) together with tRNA  supply Pyl-tRNA  for incorporation of Pyl into proteins in response to the UAG codon ( ). Because many PylRS variants possess remarkably relaxed amino acid specificity ( ), and the enzyme does not recognize the tRNA anticodon as identity element ( ), PylRS became the tRNA synthetase of choice for synthetic biologists to expand the genetic code with noncanonical amino acids ( , ). Most PylRS enzymes consist of two functional domains, an N-terminal tRNA-binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain (CTD) ( , ). The two domains are either contained in the same polypeptide or occur as separate proteins. Recently, the \u0394PylSn class of PylRS enzymes was discovered in certain archaea ( ). The \u0394PylSn lack the N-terminal domain and display strong activity of the catalytic CTD alone ( , ). In the few years since their discovery, \u0394PylSn enzymes have become a popular tool for incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) in a variety of organisms ( ). \n\n Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1 is a member of the extreme halophilic methanogens ( ); they belong to the class   Methanonatronarchaeia   in which the type species is   Methanonatronarchaeum thermophilum   ( , ). The phylogenetic affinity of this group remains a matter of debate ( ), but recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that it forms the deepest clade in the   Halobacteriota   superphylum that includes classes   Halobacteria  ,   Methanosarcinia  ,   Methanomicrobia  ,   Archaeoglobi  , and   Methanonatronarchaeia   ( ). Regardless of the exact position of this clade, it is becoming increasingly clear that methanogenesis originated early in archaeal evolution, likely in the last common ancestor of archaea, and was later lost independently in extant non-methanogen lineages within TACK superphylum and possibly later within   Halobacteriota   superphylum ( , , ). Pyrrolysine biosynthesis and incorporation of Pyl into several proteins specific to methanogenesis (e.g. methylamine methyltransferases) is observed in the methanogenic lineages of   Halobacteriota   and   Thermoplasmatota   (super)phyla. Thus, it is currently inferred that the Pyl system originated in the common ancestor of these two phyla which are sister groups in the archaeal phylogeny ( ). Most genomes encode a single PylRS gene. One of the few exceptions is the HMET1 genome, which harbors two different PylRS genes. \n\nHere we characterize the unusual properties and demonstrate the mutual orthogonality of the two distinct Pyl incorporation systems in   Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Plasmids \n  \nAll plasmids used in this study are listed in  . Cassettes encoding PylRS, tRNA  and Flag-SAMP1 or Flag-SAMP1(SAMP1 ) genes were synthesized and cloned into pJAM202c-based vectors by Gibson assembly. To construct plasmids containing noncognate PylRS/tRNA  pairs, PylRS and tRNA  coding sequences were swapped between different vectors by inserting the noncognate tRNA  gene into the vector devoid of tRNA  via Gibson assembly. Cassette amplification, removal of PylRS or tRNA  gene from expression vectors, and site-directed mutagenesis were done by PCR with primers listed in  . \n\n\n### Strains and culture conditions \n  \nStrains used in this study are listed in  .   Escherichia coli   (  E. coli  ) DH5\u03b1 was used for routine selection and propagation of plasmid DNA.   E. coli   GM2163 was used to prepare plasmid DNA that are free of Dam and Dcm methylations prior to   H. volcanii   transformation.   E. coli   strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37\u00b0C and   H. volcanii   cells were grown at 42\u00b0C in Hv-YPC by rotary shaking at 200 rpm. Media were supplemented with ampicillin (Amp, 0.1 mg/ml), spectinomycin (Sm, 50 \u03bcg/ml), tetracycline (Tet, 12.5 \u03bcg/ml), kanamycin (Km, 50 mg/ml), novobiocin (Nv, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml), N\u03f5-Boc- -lysine (BocK, 1mM) and 3-iodo- -Phe (3-I-Phe, 1mM) as needed. Solid medium containing 2.0% (wt/vol) agar was used to culture   H. volcanii   cells.   H. volcanii   colonies were streaked from the -80\u00b0C freezer stocks onto Hv-YPC agar plates and freshly isolated colonies of   H. volcanii   were inoculated into 2.5 ml medium and grown to log phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD ], 0.6 to 1.2). The log-phase cells were then subcultured into 4.0 ml fresh Hv-YPC medium for future assays. \n\n\n###  In vivo   activity and solubility assays for PylRS/tRNA  pairs in   E. coli  \n  \nTo measure the amber suppression activity of PylRS/tRNA  pairs in   E. coli  , pSCW11-PylRS/tRNA  and pBAD-sfGFP(150TAG) plasmids were co-transformed into   E. coli   TOP10 cells via electroporation. The transformed cells were recovered for 1 hour in 500 \u03bcl SOC medium at 37\u00b0C. Then, 100 \u03bcl of the transformed cells was inoculated into 1 mL fresh medium (LB containing 50 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin, 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% arabinose) in 15 mL culture tube, supplemented with or without 1 mM BocK. OD  and sfGFP fluorescence (\u03bbex: 480 nm; \u03bbem: 520 nm) were measured during overnight culture at 37\u00b0C. For PylRS solubility assay, the   E. coli   BL21(DE3) cells containing different pET28a-PylRS plasmids were incubated at 37\u00b0C, grown to OD  at 0.6, followed by protein expression induction by addition of 1 mM IPTG at 20 \u00b0C for 16 hr.   E. coli   cells were harvested via centrifugation (5,000   g   for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C) and divided into two portions. One portion was resuspended in 2X reducing SDS loading buffer and boiled for 15 minutes prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, which represents the whole cell lysate portion. To prepare the supernatant extract, the harvested cells of the second portion were lysed by French press homogenization (12,000 lb/in ) in lysis buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1 mM DTT and 300 mM or 500 mM) supplemented with 1 mg\u00b7ml  DNase I (Tiangen) and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (20,000   g   for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C) to remove the cell debris. The supernatant faction (20 \u03bcl) was collected and mixed with an equal volume of 2X SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The amount of soluble PylRS proteins by two different treatments was determined on 12% reducing SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie G250 dye. \n\n\n###  In vivo   activity assay for the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs in   H. volcanii  \n  \nTo examine the amber suppression activity,   H. volcanii   cells expressing different plasmids containing reporter proteins and different combinations of the wild-type or engineered PylRS/tRNA  (listed in  ) were re-patched on the Hv-YPC plate, then were grown to log phase (OD  at 0.4 to 0.8) in Hv-YPC medium. The mid-log phase cells (OD , 0.6 to 0.8) were inoculated into 4 ml fresh Hv-YPC medium supplemented Nv, with or without 1mM ncAAs (BocK and 3-I-Phe) and grown to stationary phase (OD , 2.0 to 3.0). Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation (10,000   g  , 5 min, 25\u00b0C) and used to analyze the expression level of SAMP1 reporter proteins by immunoblotting as described below. \n\n\n### SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis \n  \nCell pellets (2 OD  units) were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of 2X SDS-PAGE loading buffer by vigorous pipetting and vortexing and were then boiled for 15 minutes prior to separation by SDS-PAGE analysis. The OD  of the cell culture was measured to normalize the loading amount of total cellular proteins (0.1 units per lane) and equivalent levels of protein loading were confirmed by Coomassie G250 staining of parallel gels. Total cellular proteins were separated on 12% reducing SDS-PAGE gel followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham) according to the BioRad standard protocol. Flag-tagged proteins were detected by alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoreactive antigens were detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrate (Immobilon). \n\n\n### Immunoprecipitation \n  \n H. volcanii   cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000   g  , 10 min, 25\u00b0C) and washed twice with TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Cell pellets were stored at -20\u00b0C until further use. The harvested cells were lysed by French press homogenization (12,000 lb/in ) in lysis buffer composed of TBS supplemented with 0.1 mM CaCl , 2 mM MgCl , DNase I and protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000   g  , 40 min, 4\u00b0C) and filtration (0.22 \u03bcm) and the clarified cell lysate was then applied to an anti-Flag column pre-equilibrated with TBS. The column was 1 cm in diameter and was filled with 0.2\u20130.4 ml anti-Flag G1 affinity resin (Genscript). The supernatant was incubated with resin at room temperature for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed in 15 mL TBS prior to elution in 100 \u03bcl 2X reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The purified Flag-tagged proteins were separated on 12% reducing SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie G250 dye. The protein band representing SAMP1(SAMP1 )-MoaE conjugate at 50 kDa was cut for further analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). \n\n\n### In-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis \n  \nProteins of interest were first excised from the gel. After destaining, reduction and alkylation, the proteins in gel were digested by 0.02 \u03bcg/\u03bcl trypsin. The peptides were then extracted by acetonitrile. After drying, the peptides were dissolved in 2% (vol/vol) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid. A total of 1 \u03bcg peptides was injected into an Q Exactive HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Scientific). The LC conditions and MS parameters were described previously ( ). The raw data was analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 1.4 with the Mascot search algorithm. Mascot was set up to search the database including all cellular proteins of   H. volcanii   DS2, common pollution proteins, SAMP1-MoaE protein with BocK and 20 natural amino acids at G24 residue and SAMP1-MoaE protein with BocK, 3-I-Phe and 20 natural amino acids at G14 and G24 residue assuming the digestion with trypsin. Precursor and fragment mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm and 50 mmu, respectively. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Deamidation of Asn and Gln and oxidation of Met were specified as variable modifications. The false-discovery rate (FDR) was specified at 1.0% to filter the peptides. Finally, the MS/MS spectrums were labeled by pLabel software. \n\n\n### 3D homology structural modeling and analysis \n  \nHMET1 PylRS1 and PylRS2 were comparatively modelled by Phyre2 (Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine ( ) and 100% of residues modelled at\u00a0>\u00a090% confidence. Visualization and electrostatic potentials analysis of HMET1 PylRS1 and PylRS2 and   M. mazei   PylRS catalytic domain (PDB 2ZIM) were conducted by UCSF Chimera ( ). Superposition of the model structure of HMET1 PylRS1/2 onto   Desulfitobacterium hafniense (D. hafniense)   PylRS-tRNA  complex (PDB 2ZNI) and superposition of crystal structures of   H. volcanii   SAMP1 and UbaA onto   E. coli   MoeB-MoaD complex (PDB 3PO0) were also obtained using UCSF Chimera. \n\n\n### Sequence and phylogenetic analysis \n  \nAmino acid sequences and comparative genomic data were retrieved from the archaeal clusters of orthologous genes (arCOG) database ( ). Multiple alignment of PylS proteins was constructed using MUSCLE ( ). The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built using IQ-TREE version 2.1.2 based on the best-fitting model, LG\u00a0+\u00a0I\u00a0+\u00a0G4 ( ). PSI-BLAST ( ) with default parameters was used to search for PylS homologs in the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database. To identify genes with in-frame stop codons, arCOG profiles were mapped to six-frame genome translations using PSI-BLAST ( ),and then, the genome fragments corresponding to the full-length hit matches were scanned for stop codons (excluding the first and the last 20 codons). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Occurrence of the \u0394PylSn-type pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase among archaea \n  \nExamination of the archaeal clusters of orthologous genes (arCOGs) ( ) revealed that PylRS is encoded in 44 of the 524 archaeal genomes, of which the \u0394PylSn enzyme is encoded only in nine complete or nearly complete genomes ( ). Among the latter,   Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis   B10 (  Thermoplasmatales  ) and   Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1 (  Methanonatronarchaeia  ) encompass two paralogous versions of   \u0394PylSn   genes (Figure   and  ). These are the only known organisms that encode two distinct PylRS enzymes ( ). Using PylRS from HMET1 (OKY77552.1) as a query, we additionally searched the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database (December 2021) to identify other such genomes, but no sufficiently complete genomes with two or more paralogs of \u0394PylSn were found. Therefore, for further analysis, we proceeded with complete genomes from the arCOG database ( ). Using the multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of non-redundant PylRS sequences, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree and mapped the Pyl biosynthesis and incorporation genes   pylS/pylD/pylC   gene neighborhoods to the branches of this tree (Figure  ,  ). Generally, the tree topology was compatible with the phylogeny of the respective archaeal species, with monophyletic   Methanosarcinales  ,   Methanonatronarchaeia   and   Thermoplasmales  . The single exception was   pylS   from   Methermicoccus shengliensis   DSM 18856, which belongs to the phylum   Methanosarcinales   and appears to represent a rare case of horizontal gene transfer from a phylogenetically distant archaeal lineage and displacement of Pyl biosynthesis genes. These observations suggest that duplications of   pylS   genes and tRNA  genes (  pylT  ) encoded upstream of   pylS   occurred independently in HMET1 and   M.\u00a0luminyensis   B10. \n  \nPhylogenetic tree of PylRS proteins and the gene neighborhoods of   pylS   genes. Maximum-likelihood, unrooted phylogenetic tree was built using IQ-tree based on the multiple alignment of PylRS catalytic domain (348 amino-acid sites) with aBayes support values shown for internal branches. The root was placed between   Halobacteriota   and   Thermoplasmatota   phyla according to the established archaeal phylogeny ( ). The tree shown in this figure includes only \u0394PylSn sequences; the complete tree is provided in the Additional File 1 in Supplementary Information. The leaves are identified by GenBank protein accession numbers and species names. Two species encoding two \u0394PylSn proteins are highlighted in orange and magenta for   Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1 and   Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis   B10, respectively. Asterisk indicates the sequence from   Methermicoccus shengliensis  , which does not belong to the   Thermoplasmatales   lineage. Genomic neighborhood of   pylS   genes is mapped to each leaf and is shown to the right of the tree. The genes are shown roughly to scale as arrows. If the intergenic distance was shortened for compactness, it is shown by a dashed line or, if genes are not next to each other, using the \u2018//\u2019 symbol as a separator. Protein names are provided below the arrows if available. The genes are colored according to their general functions as follows: yellow, genes involved in Pyl biosynthesis; pale blue, genes involved in methanogenesis; green, tightly linked pair of genes coding for putative amino acid transporter RhaT and uncharacterized protein of arCOG04962; white, all other genes. The genes containing in-frame stop codon are marked by red rectangles. Detailed information on these neighborhoods is provided in  . \n  \nFurther analysis of HMET1 and   M. luminyensis   B10 genomes led to the identification of different sets of genes that appear to be duplicated in addition to   pylS  . In HMET1, the duplicated genes include the Pyl biosynthesis   pylB   gene encoding (2R,3R)-3-methylornithine synthase,   mtmB   encoding monomethylamine methyltransferase and   mtbC1   encoding the methylamine corrinoid protein, whereas in   M. luminyensis   B10, three genes for Pyl biosynthesis (  pylB  ,   pylC  ,   pylD  ),   mtmB   and   mtbC1   are duplicated. Considering that these genes often appear in the vicinity of   pylS  , most likely, in both cases, the duplication involved a large DNA region, with several genes lost or transposed to other locations during subsequent evolution. Next, we analyzed the mono-, bi- and trimethylamine methyltransferase genes (  mtmB  ,   mtbB   and   mttB  ) containing an in-frame stop codon in the nine genomes encoding \u0394PylSn; the number of TAG-containing genes in these genomes ranged from two to six ( ). Although the available data are insufficient for rigorous statistical testing, these observations suggest that   pylS   duplication is not tightly linked to duplication(s) of the Pyl encoding genes. Thus, the occurrence of two PylRS enzymes in HMET1 appears not to be necessitated by an increased number of UAG codons in this genome. \n\n\n###  Candidatus   Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1 encodes two distinct PylRS/tRNA  pairs \n  \nExtension of our genomic analysis of   pylS   genes to the cognate tRNA  species led to the remarkable discovery, in the HMET1 strain, of two tRNA  (  pylT  ) genes (Figure  ), with different discriminator bases (position 73 of the tRNA) ( ). Like all other known tRNA  species, HMET1 tRNA 1 uses the discriminator base G, whereas HMET1 tRNA 2 has A as discriminator base. The   pylT   genes are located adjacent to the   pylS   genes:   pylT1   and   pylT2   are immediately upstream of   pylS1   and   pylS2  , respectively (Figure  ). These   pylT   genes contain one or two introns with bulge-helix-bulge splicing motifs that presumably are removed during processing of the HMET1 pre-tRNA  ( , ) ( ). HMET1 tRNA 1 resembles the canonical tRNA  except for the presence of an extra nucleotide between the D-arm and the anticodon arm (Figure  ), similar to the tRNA  of methanogenic archaeon ISO4-G1 ( ). In contrast, tRNA 2 contains base substitutions in the variable loop, in addition to the noncanonical A73 (Figure  ). Could PylRS1 with tRNA 1 and PylRS2 with tRNA 2 form cognate pairs? \n  \nPrediction and structural analysis of the two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs. (  A  ) Inferred cloverleaf structures of HMET1 tRNA 1 and tRNA 2 compared with the   M. alvus   tRNA . (  B  ) 3D structural model of the two HMET1 PylRSs (all residues modeled at\u00a0>\u00a090% confidence) compared with the X-ray crystal structure of   M. alvus   PylRS (PDB 6JP2). Electrostatic potential of the selected PylRSs is represented by coulombic surface coloring with the unit of the potential colored in the range of values\u00a0\u2212\u00a010 (red), 0 (white), and 10 (blue) kcal/mol \u00b7 e using Chimera v 1.12. \n  \nPylRS1 and PylRS2 show 53% sequence identity; the predicted 3D structures of both enzymes are similar and closely resemble the catalytic domain of   Methanomethylophilus alvus   (  M. alvus  ) PylRS and other enzymes of the Class II aaRS family as demonstrated by homology modeling (Figure  ). HMET1, found in hypersaline environments, contains enzymes that often have reduced levels of hydrophobic residues ( ). Not surprisingly, the surface of HMET1 PylRSs encompasses more charged amino acids compared with   M. alvus   PylRS (Figure  ). Taken together, we discovered two novel PylRS/tRNA  pairs that naturally co-exist in the extremophile HMET1. \n\n\n### Development of a facile system for   in vivo   characterization of the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs \n  \nTo determine whether the PylRS/tRNA  pairs are functional   in vivo  , we first investigated the ability of PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair to produce superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) from the   sfGFP(150TAG)   gene in the presence and in the absence of the non-proteinogenic amino acid BocK, a known substrate for many PylRS enzymes. Expression in   E. coli   by   Methanosarcina mazei   (  M.\u00a0mazei  ) and   M. alvus   PylRS/tRNA  pairs produces a large amount of soluble sfGFP (positive control), whereas expression of the HMET1 PylRS1/tRNA 1 pair yielded only insoluble PylRS in the supernatant extract after cell lysis ( ). This finding is not surprising because halophilic enzymes often aggregate and misfold in low ionic conditions ( ). Thus, functional characterization of HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  translation products in the well-established   E. coli   system is unfeasible. \n\nTherefore, we decided to use   H. volcanii  , a model halophilic euryarchaeon ( ), as the chassis for functional characterization of the two PylRS/tRNA  pairs from HMET1. A system intended for genetic code expansion in   H. volcanii   requires: (i) high level expression of the PylRS/tRNA  pair; and (ii) a reporter protein that can be readily detected for measuring the BocK incorporation in response to an in-frame UAG stop codon. We developed a plasmid-based cassette for co-expressing the PylRS/tRNA  pair and a small archaeal ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SAMP1) as the reporter in   H. volcanii   (Figure  ). The reasons for the choice of SAMP1 were: (i) SAMP1 is small and a homolog of ubiquitin, which has often been utilized as the reporter protein for genetic code expansion experiments ( ), (ii) the known structure of SAMP1 can guide us to select permissive sites for BocK incorporation; (iii) only full-length SAMP1 can modify protein substrates, such as MoaE (the large subunit of molybdopterin synthase), and the SAMP1 conjugate can be readily detected by immunoblotting ( ). In contrast, unsuccessful UAG suppression leads to truncated SAMP1 protein, which is unable to modify cellular substrates. Immunoblotting was utilized to estimate UAG suppression of the reporter protein. \n  \nHeterologous protein expression in   H. volcanii  . (  A  ) Schematic representation of the shuttle plasmid for co-expression of genes encoding PylRS/tRNA  pairs and SAMP1 protein. Promoters, terminators, and RBS are indicated. To estimate UAG suppression activity of HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs, a SAMP1 gene with UAG as codon 24 (SAMP1 ) was utilized. (  B  ) Soluble PylRS1 and PylRS2 proteins in the supernatant extract after cell lysis were detected via anti-His tag antibody immunoblotting (IB). (  C  ) The expression of the wild-type Flag-SAMP1 was detected via anti-Flag antibody IB in cell lysate. The lower band corresponds to the full-length SAMP1 that is not conjugated with other proteins and the upper band corresponds to the SAMP1-MoaE conjugate. (  D  ) The predicted structural model of SAMP1-UbaA complex based on the crystal structure of a bacterial MoeB-MoaD complex (1JW9). The glycine 14 and 24 residue (cyan) of the wild-type SAMP1 (PDB 3PO0) for site-specific incorporation of ncAAs are indicated. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and representative images are shown. \n  \nFor expression of tRNA  in   H. volcanii  , we placed the tRNA coding sequence and 15 nt each of upstream and downstream flanking sequences under control of the constitutive tRNA  promoter ( ). A polycistronic expression system driven by a strong constitutive promoter was utilized for producing PylRS and the reporter protein SAMP1 (Figure  ). The recombinant PylRS protein with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag expressed well in   H. volcanii   and was soluble in the supernatant extract after cell lysis (Figure  ). In order to increase the expression level of the   samp1   gene, a ribosome binding site (RBS) sequence was inserted ahead of the SAMP1 coding sequence ( ), resulting in substantially increased abundance of free SAMP1 protein as well as its major conjugated form (SAMP1-MoaE) (Figure  ). \n\nNext, we sought to determine the permissive site(s) in the SAMP1 protein for site-specific incorporation of BocK. Our structural modeling showed that Gly24 is away from the SAMP1-UbaA (the   H. volcanii   ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme homolog) interface, and Gly24 is located in the solvent-exposed loop (Figure  ). Thus, a SAMP1 gene with UAG as codon 24 (SAMP1 ) provides the reporter protein SAMP1BocK24 where BocK should have a minimal impact on the structure and function of SAMP1. Because SAMP1 was mainly in the conjugated form under our culture conditions (Figure  ), we evaluated the   in vivo   activity of the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs by measuring the protein abundance of the SAMP1 -MoaE conjugate in the following experiments. \n\n\n### Both HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are active and orthogonal in   H. volcanii  \n  \nIn order to test whether the two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are functional and orthogonal in   H. volcanii  , we transformed plasmids encoding the PylRS/tRNA  pairs and SAMP1 , and cultured the cells in the presence or in the absence of 1 mM BocK. The ability to form UAG suppressor BocK-tRNA  was assayed by monitoring the production of the SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate via anti-Flag immunoblotting. The results demonstrated that both HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs facilitated efficient amber suppression as assessed by comparing the abundance of the produced SAMP1-MoaE conjugate to that formed by the wild-type under the same conditions (Figure  - , lanes 4 versus 2). We observed minimal UAG readthrough by HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs in the absence of BocK (Figure  - , lane 3) or when the HMET1 PylRS or tRNA  were omitted (Figure  - , lanes 5 to 8). Thus, both HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are orthogonal with respect to the aaRS enzymes and tRNA species endogenously present in   H.\u00a0volcanii  . \n  \nBoth HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are active and orthogonal in   H. volcanii  . (  A-B  ) Activity and orthogonality tests of HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs in the presence and absence of BocK when compared to the abundance of wild-type SAMP1-MoaE conjugate formed under the same conditions. SAMP1-MoaE and SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugates were detected by anti-Flag antibody immunoblotting in cell lysate. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and representative images are shown. (  C  ) High mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry MS/MS unambiguously confirmed site-specific incorporation of BocK mediated by PylRS1/tRNA 1 (left) and PylRS2/tRNA 2 (right). Representative MS/MS spectra of BocK-containing peptides derived by collision-induced dissociation of the doubly charged precursor after trypsin digestion of the purified SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate. The y-ion (colored blue) and b-ion (colored red) series detected are indicated. \n  \nTo further validate BocK incorporation, the reporter protein was analyzed with LC-MS/MS. The SAMP1BocK24 and SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate were purified by immunoprecipitation, and they represent the two major bands on the SDS-PAGE gel ( ). The conjugate band was extracted from the gel and then digested by trypsin and analyzed with tandem MS. A series of b and y ions unambiguously indicate that BocK was incorporated at the UAG-specified position 24 (Figure  ). This result confirms that native HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs incorporate BocK into proteins via genetic code expansion in   H. volcanii  . \n\nThe discriminator base G73 is a major tRNA  identity element ( ). Because HMET1 tRNA 1 contains the canonical G73 while tRNA 2 carries A73, we tested the effect of swapping the N73 base (between tRNA 1 and tRNA 2) on UAG suppression. The G73A mutation in tRNA 1 decreased suppression efficiency markedly (Figure  , lanes 9\u201310), which is consistent with a previous result using a G73A   Methanosarcina barkeri   tRNA  variant that reduced suppression efficiency by\u00a0\u2248\u00a070% ( ). Interestingly, the A73G mutation in tRNA 2 also led to a drastic decrease in amber suppression efficiency (Figure  , lanes 9\u201310). These findings support the notion that PylRS1 with tRNA 1, and PylRS2 with tRNA 2 are cognate pairs and that the nature of the discriminator base alone determines the mutual orthogonality of tRNA 1 and tRNA 2 (Figure  ). \n\n\n### The two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are mutually orthogonal \n  \nTo better understand the role of the A or G discriminator base in tRNA 1 and tRNA 2, respectively, we analyzed the predicted structures of PylRS1 and PylRS2 superimposed onto the crystal structure of the   Desulfitobacterium hafniense   PylRS-tRNA  complex ( ). We were especially interested in the aaRS\u2013tRNA interaction surface close to the discriminator base, focusing on the enzyme's motif 2 loop that is proximal to N73 and plays an essential role in the recognition of the tRNA CCA terminus. To our surprise, we found that the PylRS2 motif 2 loop is shorter than that of PylRS1 (Figure  ). \n  \nThe A73 discriminator of tRNA 2 and a shorter motif 2 loop in PylRS2 determine the mutual orthogonality between the two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs. (  A  ) 3D structural models of HMET1 PylRS1 and PylRS2 (blue and green) in complex with   Desulfitobacterium hafniense   tRNA  (yellow). Magnified view shows the recognition of the CCA terminus by the motif 2 loop. (  B-D  ) Production of SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate was mediated by cognate, non-cognate and engineered PylRS/tRNA  pairs analyzed with anti-Flag immunoblotting (IB) in cell lysate. mPylRS1 (PylRS1 with motif 2 loop from PylRS2) and mtRNA 1 (tRNA 1 with G73A mutation) are labelled red. Migration of SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate is indicated. Schematic on the right summarizing the activity and functional orthogonality between different cognate, non-cognate and engineered HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs. Black arrows indicate high activity, and dashed grey arrows indicate minimal activity. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and representative images are shown. See Materials and Methods for details. \n  \nNext, we aimed to study whether the two PylRS/tRNA  pairs are mutually orthogonal in their aminoacylation specificity when expressed in   H. volcanii  . We swapped the PylRS and tRNA  coding sequences between expression vectors producing PylRS/tRNA  pairs and the SAMP1BocK24 reporter protein. Minimal readthrough of the amber codon was observed when the HMET1 PylRS paired with its non-cognate tRNA  in the presence or in the absence of BocK (Figure  , lanes 5\u20136 and 11\u201312). This result demonstrates that these two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are mutually orthogonal in   H. volcanii  . To further validate this result, we rationally transplanted each unique feature (A73 or shorter motif 2 loop) from the PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair to the PylRS1/tRNA 1 pair. The PylRS1 with the short motif 2 loop from PylRS2 and tRNA 1 with G73A mutation are designated as mPylRS1 and mtRNA 1, respectively (Figure  - ). We compared the production of the SAMP1BocK24-MoaE conjugate by these engineered PylRS/tRNA  pairs to that mediated by HMET1 cognate PylRS/tRNA  pairs. Surprisingly, mPylRS1/tRNA 2 and PylRS2/mtRNA 1 pairs showed UAG suppression efficiency comparable to that of HMET1 cognate PylRS1/tRNA  pairs (Figure  - , lanes 7 versus 3). In contrast, no SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate was detected in the presence of engineered mPylRS1/tRNA 1 and PylRS1/mtRNA 1 pairs (Figure  - , lane 9). These results demonstrate that the shorter motif 2 loop in PylRS2 combined with the discriminator base A73 in tRNA 2 determine the mutual orthogonality of the two PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs in HMET1. \n\n\n### Motif 2 loop length of PylRS2 determines its ability to acylate tRNA 2 \n  \nTo better understand the relationship of the short motif 2 loop in PylRS2 and the discriminator base A73 in tRNA 2, we constructed and examined a multiple amino acid sequence alignment of HMET1 PylRS1 and PylRS2 with the other known C-terminal domain-only PylRS enzymes. The most remarkable observed difference was that HMET1 PylRS2 contains a shorter (by one amino acid residue) motif 2 loop (Figure  ). Next, we sought to demonstrate that this single amino acid deletion accounts for its activity towards tRNA 2. We constructed a series of PylRS2 variants with a shortened motif 2 by rational design (sV1-sV6). We also generated a series of PylRS2 variants with the full-length canonical motif 2 loop as found in other PylRSs (cV1-6). We compared the production of the SAMP1BocK24-MoaE conjugate by these engineered PylRS/tRNA  pairs to that mediated by the wild-type PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair. All PylRS2 variants (sV1-6) with one amino acid deletion in the motif 2 loop could still function with tRNA 2, although these PylRS2/tRNA  pairs varied in UAG suppression efficiency (Figure  , lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14). In contrast, we observed minimal amber codon readthrough by engineered PylRS/tRNA  pairs consisting of \u2018full-length\u2019 PylRS2 variants (cV1-6) and tRNA 2 in the presence of BocK (Figure  , lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14), compared to the wild-type PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair (Figure  , lane 2). These findings suggest that the length of motif 2 loop in PylRS2 determines the capacity of these enzyme variants to acylate the non-canonical tRNA 2 (with the discriminator base A73). \n  \nMotif 2 loop length of PylRS2 determines its ability to acylate tRNA 2. (  A  ) Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of \u0394PylSn enzymes from HMET1,   M. luminyensis   B10 and   M. alvus  . The predicted secondary structure elements including \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets and random coils are indicated above the PylRS sequence. Residues corresponding to the motif 2 loop of PylRS are highlighted in red. (  B  ) Production of SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate by PylRS2 variants (sV1-6) co-expressed with HMET1 tRNA 2 analyzed with anti-Flag IB in cell lysate. The sV1-6 are PylRS2 variants with a shortened motif 2 loop (one amino acid deletion). (  C  ) Production of SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate by PylRS2 variants (cV1-6) co-expressed with HMET1 tRNA 2 analyzed with anti-Flag IB in cell lysate. The cV1-V6 are PylRS2 variants with the full-length canonical motif 2 loop as found in other six \u0394PylSn enzymes from   M. mazei  ,   D. hafniense  ,   M. alvus  ,   Candidatus   Methanoplasma termitum MpT1,   Candidatus   Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis Issoire-Mx1 and   Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis   B10. The amino acid sequence of motif 2 loop in PylRS2 variants (sV1-6 and cV1-6) is shown in the table on top of the immunoblot images. Migration of SAMP1Bock24-MoaE conjugate is indicated. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and representative images are shown. See Materials and Methods for details. \n  \nIn the absence of BocK, the UAG readthrough efficiency of SAMP1  by tRNA 2 and PylRS variants (sV1-6) was low, but non-negligible (Figure  , lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13). To determine the nature of the mis-incorporated canonical amino acids, the relevant SAMP1-MoaE conjugate products formed by the PylRS2 variants sV1 and sV6 (Figure  , lanes 3 and 13, respectively) were isolated and analyzed by LC-LC/MS. Lys and Gln were found to be mis-incorporated when PylRS2 variant sV1 (DSKN) was used ( ), and Glu, Lys and Gln were identified using PylRS2 variant sV6 (SGKN) (  and  ). To answer the question whether these mis-incorporated amino acids are carried by tRNA 2 to the ribosome, we undertook an experiment in the absence of HMET1 tRNA 2. Only minimal UAG readthrough was observed with PylRS2 variants (sV1-sV6) in the presence or in the absence of BocK (  and  , lanes 9\u201314 versus lanes 3\u20138). Thus, it appears that tRNA 2 is mainly responsible for the observed low level misincorporation. As shown above, the PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair is completely orthogonal with respect to the endogenous   H. volcanii   aaRSs and tRNAs (Figure   and   lane1); thus, we suggest that engineering of the PylRS2 motif 2 could impair binding to tRNA 2, thus allowing endogenous aaRSs to charge canonical amino acids (e.g. Lys or Gln) onto tRNA 2. \n\n\n### Encoding two distinct ncAAs into one protein by the mutually orthogonal HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs \n  \nAs a demonstration of the orthogonality of the two PylRS/tRNA  systems, we decided to incorporate two distinct ncAAs into a single polypeptide. To achieve this goal, engineering of the amino acid-binding pocket of PylRS1 and PylRS2 for selective incorporation of two different ncAAs, and construction of a tRNA  species able to suppress UAA or UGA were required. The repertoire of ncAAs that can be acylated to tRNA  by PylRS variants has been greatly expanded in recent years so that PylRS variants exist that are selective for several ncAA substrates but exclude others ( ). For instance, in previous work, we constructed a highly active PylRS mutant (IFRS; Asn346Ser/Cys348Ile) that is selective for 3-iodo- -Phe (3-I-Phe) but rejects BocK ( ). From the alignment of the amino acid-binding pockets of HMET1 PylRS1 and IFRS, we identified Asn163 and Val165 in PylRS1 as the residues corresponding to Asn346 and Cys348 in IFRS, and introduced the corresponding Asn163Ser and Val165Ile amino acid substitutions into HMET1 PylRS1 (PylRS1-SI). The PylRS1-SI/tRNA 1 pair exhibited strong amber suppression in a 3-I-Phe-dependent manner as measured by the production of a SAMP1(3I)24-MoaE conjugate (Figure  ). Given that PylRS lacks anticodon recognition ( ) and our PylRS/tRNA  pairs would decode diverse codons ( ), we next mutated the tRNA 2 anticodon to generate tRNA 2  which would facilitate BocK incorporation into SAMP1 at the position directed by the UAA codon. Based on the analysis of the SAMP1 structure, the Gly14 codon was mutated to UAA for BocK incorporation (Figure  ). We transformed   H. volcanii   with plasmids encoding the HMET1 PylRS2/tRNA 2  pair and SAMP1( ), and then cultured the cells in the presence or absence of 1 mM BocK. The PylRS2/tRNA 2  pair exhibited ochre suppression in a BocK-dependent manner (Figure  ). Only a small amount of SAMP1BocK14-MoaE conjugate was formed by the PylRS2/tRNA 2  pair, which is consistent with the previous finding that UAA/UGA mediated suppression is inefficient in   H. volcanii   ( ). Thus, we now developed PylRS/tRNA  pairs for site-specific incorporation in   H. volcanii   of 3-I-Phe and BocK directed by UAG and UAA codons, respectively. \n  \nEncoding two distinct ncAAs using mutually orthogonal HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs. (  A  ) Production of SAMP1(3I)24-MoaE conjugate by PylRS1-SI/tRNA 1 pair analyzed by anti-Flag immunoblotting (IB) in cell lysate. (  B  ) Production of the SAMP1BocK14-MoaE conjugate by PylRS2/tRNA 2  pair analyzed by anti-Flag IB in cell lysate. (  C  ) Detection of purified SAMP1(3I)14Bock24-MoaE conjugate produced by PylRS1-SI/tRNA 1 and PylRS2/tRNA 2  pairs. Total 100 ml   H. volcanii   cells expressing the one-plasmid system were grown in the presence and absence of 3-I-phe and BocK followed by the anti-Flag immunoprecipitation to enrich the SAMP1(3I)14Bock24-MoaE conjugate. Migration of SAMP1(3I)14Bock24-MoaE conjugate is indicated. The same amount of cellular proteins were utilized for immuno-enrichment of Flag-tagged proteins confirmed by Coomassie blue staining of the input. Experiments were performed in duplicates, and representative images are shown. See Materials and Methods for details. \n  \nTo demonstrate simultaneous incorporation of 3-I-Phe and BocK into a single protein in response to two distinct codons in   H. volcanii  , we chose a one-plasmid system encoding two copies of SAMP1  and one copy of PylRS1-SI/tRNA 1 and PylRS2/tRNA 2  ( ).   H. volcanii   cells expressing the one-plasmid system were grown in the presence or absence of 3-I-Phe and BocK followed by the anti-Flag immunoprecipitation to enrich the reporter proteins. Production of a SAMP1(3I)14Bock24-MoaE conjugate was dependent on the addition of both ncAAs (Figure  ). Further LC-MS/MS analysis of the purified reporter protein confirmed that BocK and 3-I-Phe were incorporated at the TAA and TAG-directed positions respectively ( ). This result demonstrates that the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs function in the same heterologous   H. volcanii   cell to incorporate distinct ncAAs into a single polypeptide programmed by different stop codons. Thus, mutual orthogonality, most likely, was the original property of these PylRS/tRNA  pairs in HMET1. \n\nA different scenario has been reported previously where PylRS/tRNA pairs from different archaea were shown to be mutually orthogonal based on their tRNA recognition mode. This allowed the rational design of two orthogonal PylRS/tRNA pairs with distinct amino acid specificities that can operate together in a host cell ( , ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Potential applications of HMET1 PylRS/tRNA -derived pairs in archaea \n  \nA variety of PylRS/tRNA -derived pairs have been developed in bacteria and eukaryotic cells to incorporate useful Pyl derivatives into proteins of interest ( ), enabling many important applications including identification of weak protein-protein interactions in living cells ( ), generation of physiologically relevant proteins with authentic post-translational modifications (e.g. acetylation) ( ), and protein labelling for cellular imaging ( ). However, genetic incorporation of ncAA into protein mediated by engineered aaRS/tRNA pairs in archaea, the third domain of life, has never been reported before. As shown in this work, it is facile to generate designated PylRS/tRNA  pairs in   H. volcanii   by transplanting previously reported mutations into HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs. We envision HMET1 PylRS/tRNA -derived pairs could be further engineered and optimized to enrich the toolbox for dissecting fundamental biological processes in archaea. \n\nHalophilic enzymes are of major interest to many industrial applications as they serve as efficient catalysts to produce biomaterials and biofuels in low water activity conditions ( ). For instance, halophilic pyrophosphatase displays superior catalytic activity at high concentrations of organic solvents ( ). However, expression of halophilic enzymes in heterologous hosts, such as   E. coli  , is often problematic because these proteins tend to misfold and aggregate in a low ionic strength environment. Here we demonstrate that   H. volcanii   can function as a facile chassis to characterize novel enzymes, discovered by mining metagenomic and microbial genomic data, from halophiles that are usually difficult or impossible to culture. In particular, novel aaRS candidates identified in the microbial dark matter ( , ) could be good targets. Furthermore, the ability to genetically encode ncAAs has greatly expanded structural and functional repertoire of proteins. Examples include catalytic efficiency and thermal stability of proteins improved by genetic code expansion ( ). Thus, introducing ncAAs into proteins of interest in   H. volcanii in vivo   using the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA -derived pairs can be expected to open a new avenue for halophilic protein engineering and biotechnological applications. \n\n\n### Why have two PylRS/tRNA pairs in the same organism? \n  \nA simple argument suggests that two   \u0394PylSn   gene copies could be needed for efficient translation of in-frame UAG stop codons with Pyl in the relevant genes in the HMET1 genome. However, the data in   indicate that this is not the case because the HMET1 genome contains an average number of such genes compared with the seven other archaea that only possess a single   \u0394PylSn   copy. These two PylRS enzymes might not be expressed under the same growth conditions, but rather, in response to different environmental cues, ensuring the presence of at least one active PylRS/tRNA  pair at all times during the growth cycle. The fact the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pairs are mutually orthogonal is far more interesting. Although the translation of UAG codons with BocK suggests that both HMET1 PylRS enzymes recognize Pyl, their   in vivo   amino acid specificities in HMET1 cells remain to be determined biochemically. The possibility remains that one HMET1 PylRS/tRNA  pair evolved a different amino acid specificity, necessitating the simultaneous presence of the two mutually orthogonal pairs. \n\n#### Which of the two PylRS/tRNA  is ancestral? \n  \nThe duplication of the   \u0394PylSn   gene in HMET1, followed by the emergence of two orthogonal \u0394PylSn/tRNA  pairs, is so far unique among the available genomes. The only detectable \u0394PylSn protein in the current databases with a deletion in the motif 2 loop is KXB05636.1, a truncated PylRS with 62% sequence identity to HMET1 PylRS2 ( ). This protein is encoded in a contig from a candidate division MSBL1 archaeon SCGC-AAA382A03 that also belongs to   Methanonatronarchaeia  , suggesting that the duplication event occurred at some point in the evolution of this class of archaea. Furthermore, the tree built using   pylT   genes does not show any major deviations from the   pylS   tree ( ), suggesting that   pylT   was a part of the duplicated region, evolving in parallel with the cognate PylRS (Figure  ). Comparison of the   pylS   gene neighborhoods ( ) suggests that PylRS2 is the ancestral form because it is encoded in the vicinity of the pair of genes encoding the putative permease RhaT and an uncharacterized protein from arCOG04962 (Figure  ). The latter pair of tightly linked genes is present in similar neighborhoods in the majority of Thermoplasmatales genomes that contain a single   pylS   gene, so this gene arrangement is likely to be ancestral. If this is the case, the duplication of a large region encoding   pylS  ,   pylB   and several other genes, including methylamine methyltransferases with an in-frame UAG codon, most likely, occurred before the deletion in the PylRS2 motif\u00a02 loop. A similar independent duplication that occurred in the lineage of   M. luminyensis   B10 did not result in analogous changes in either \u0394PylSn or the cognate tRNA . It remains to be determined whether the \u0394PylSn/tRNA  pairs in this species are mutually orthogonal. \n\n\n#### Why is the PylRS2/tRNA 2 pair absent in the overwhelming majority of Pyl encoding organisms? \n  \nAs mentioned above, apart from HMET1, only a candidate division MSBL1 archaeon SCGC-AAA382A03 ( ) may have a PylRS2-like enzyme (with a 1 aa deletion). Likewise, the presence of a discriminator A73 tRNA  so far was detected only in these two organisms ( ). Why did PylRS identity switch to a G73 discriminator base? A possible reason might be the increased substrate specificity conferred by the G73 discriminator base given that the majority of tRNAs use the A73 identity element. For PylRS enzymes (  e.g. Desulfitobacterium hafniense  ) a G73\u2192A73 switch lowers the catalytic efficiency \u223c100 fold ( ). \n\n\n\n### tRNA identity and genetic code \n  \nThe mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs in HMET1 provide the clearest example yet for the importance of a single base change in the discriminator position leading to a concurrent identity change. \n\nThe co-existence and natural orthogonality of the two HMET1 PylRS/tRNA pairs also offer unique insights into the prospect of a still expanding genetic code. Studies based on the conspicuous absence of the tRNA  species from eukaryotic genomes suggested that genetic code expansion halted due to functional and structural constraints in the tRNA structure that limit the effective use of newly evolved tRNA identities ( ). However, the HMET1 PylRS/tRNA pairs showcase that new tRNA identities can emerge with minimal changes of a tRNA if an aaRS partner is able to adapt to those changes. Similar cases were recently reported for discriminator base variants of a methanogen tRNA  coupled with a cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase variant with a mutated small loop ( ), and for a   Streptomyces   tRNA with Ala anticodon that is exclusively acylated with Pro by a noncanonical prolyl-tRNA synthetase ( ). Thus, simultaneous/tandem duplication of tRNA and aaRS genes might lead to orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs able to evolve novel amino acid specificities. \n\n\n\n## DATA AVAILABILITY \n  \nThe mass spectrometry raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium under the dataset identifier PXD027053 as well as CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) of China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) with accession number CNP0001963. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9071458, "text_md5": "dbba356dc1a9c8c95b47cc9417c1c063", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 325], "journal": [326, 343], "publication_year": [345, 349], "title": [360, 498], "keywords": [512, 512], "abstract": [525, 1968], "body": [1977, 50599]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35466371, "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkac271", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9071458", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9071458"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9071458\">9071458</a>", "list_title": "PMC9071458  The tRNA discriminator base defines the mutual orthogonality of two distinct pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNAPyl pairs in the same organism"}

Hypomorphic mutations in inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase regulatory subunit gamma (  IKBKG  ) encoding NEMO typically present with immunodeficiency. Here, we characterized a pediatric autoinflammatory syndrome in 3 unrelated male patients with distinct X-linked   IKBKG   germline mutations that led to overexpression of a NEMO protein isoform lacking the domain encoded by exon 5 (NEMO-\u0394ex5). This isoform failed to associate with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and dermal fibroblasts from affected patients activated NF-\u03baB in response to TNF but not TLR3 or RIG-I\u2013like receptor (RLR) stimulation when isoform levels were high. By contrast, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages that expressed NEMO-\u0394ex5 exhibited increased NF-\u03baB activation and IFN production, and blood cells from these patients expressed a strong IFN and NF-\u03baB transcriptional signature. Immune cells and TNF-stimulated dermal fibroblasts upregulated the inducible IKK protein (IKKi) that was stabilized by NEMO-\u0394ex5, promoting type I IFN induction and antiviral responses. These data revealed how   IKBKG   mutations that lead to alternative splicing of skipping exon 5 cause a clinical phenotype we have named   N  EMO   d  eleted exon 5   a  utoinflammatory   s  yndrome (NDAS), distinct from the immune deficiency syndrome resulting from loss-of-function   IKBKG   mutations. \n  \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO/IKK-\u03b3) transduces signals in response to the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, the TNF receptor superfamily, and lymphocyte antigen receptors, and thus plays a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. NEMO plays a critical role in signaling downstream of nucleic acid sensing by TLR3 and the RIG-I\u2013like receptors (RLRs), which induce IFNs essential to the antiviral immune response. NEMO relays signals from these receptors by activating both IRF3 and the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors. It activates these transcription factors by serving as an essential nonenzymatic regulator of the canonical IKK kinases (IKK-\u03b1 and IKK-\u03b2); the IKK-related kinases (TBK1 and inducible IKK [IKKi]); and other components of these signaling pathways, such as TRAF-associated NF-\u03baB regulator (TANK) and A20. Through NEMO and its co-adaptor TANK, these IKKs activate transcription by phosphorylation of IRF3 and the p65 and p105 subunits of NF-\u03baB in response to TLR3 and RLR stimulation ( ,  ). This pathway is distinct from the noncanonical IKK pathway triggered in response to activation of TNFR superfamily members leading to p52 and RELB NF-\u03baB subunit transactivation. In addition to activating TLR3 and RLR signaling, IKKi and TBK1 can also downregulate canonical IKK activity ( ,  ), but the role of cross-talk between alternative and canonical NF-\u03baB activation pathways in human disease has not been described. Sensing of viral and endogenous nucleic acids induces IFNs essential to the host antiviral immune response, a process dependent on NEMO and the canonical IKK complex. Thus, RLR, TLR3, and NEMO deficiency all lead to susceptibility to viral infection and serious sequelae, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis ( ). By contrast, activating mutations in nucleic acid sensing pathways lead to inflammatory disease ( ), although how NEMO couples with the IKK-related kinases in different cell types to maintain homeostasis, balancing inflammation and immunity, remains unclear. \n\nNEMO mutation frequently results in an X-linked clinical disorder called anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA), which is due to impaired NF-\u03baB activation in response to EDA receptor signaling during development ( ). Most NEMO mutations are hypomorphic and lead to a combined immunodeficiency and susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria, DNA viruses, and atypical mycobacteria ( ,  ). For example, deletion mutations affecting the N-terminus impair association of NEMO with the catalytic subunits IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2 and lead to fatal herpes virus infection, whereas deletion mutations of the C-terminus (\u0394CT-NEMO) lead to an autoinflammatory syndrome combined with immunodeficiency ( \u2013 ). Hence, whereas certain mutant forms of NEMO lead to disease due to loss of NF-\u03baB activation, other forms in which inflammatory disease predominates may be secondary to impaired regulation of proinflammatory pathways. Isoforms of NEMO resulting from alternative splicing have been described in cell lines and patients ( ,  \u2013 ), but the molecular mechanisms by which these isoforms lead to disease are not completely understood. \n\nHere, we describe the clinical and molecular autoinflammatory disease features associated with 3 mutations that lead to the expression of a NEMO protein isoform lacking the domain encoded by exon 5, termed NEMO-\u0394ex5. We found that NEMO-\u0394ex5 disrupted type I IFN expression in response to TLR-3 and/or RLR stimulation. However, TNF costimulation enhanced the responsiveness of this pathway in skin fibroblasts, inducing the expression of the atypical IKK kinase, IKKi, which we showed here to be specifically stabilized in the presence of NEMO-\u0394ex5. In contrast to dermal fibroblasts, patient peripheral blood monocytes, macrophages, and T cells exhibited robust proinflammatory cytokine production and an excess of IFN production, which was associated with decreased viral replication. Thus, genetically programmed expression of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 protein isoform leads to an inflammatory disease phenotype. Our data suggest that altered signaling characteristics conferred by high expression levels of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform may have a role in host immunity and inflammatory disease. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Expression of an alternative NEMO isoform causes systemic autoinflammatory disease. \n  \nWe evaluated a 5-year-old male patient (P1) who first presented with elevated serum markers of systemic inflammation and with tissue- and organ-specific inflammation starting at a few weeks of age (described in detail in Methods and  , A\u2013I; supplemental material available online with this article;  ). Briefly, initial disease manifestations included fevers, a nodular skin rash, and elevated liver enzymes that progressed to include sterile panniculitis, optic neuritis, and chorioretinitis. There was no familial history of a similar disease ( ). Extensive evaluations excluded an infectious etiology and targeted Sanger sequencing for known periodic fever genes, including   MEFV  ,   NOD2/CARD15  ,   NLRP3  , and   TNFRSFIA  , as well as whole-exome sequencing, failed to identify likely causative inherited or de novo rare missense or nonsense candidate variants. At 1 year of age, the eruption of conical-shaped teeth raised the suspicion of EDA. Although the absence of infections made classic EDA with immune deficiency (EDA-ID) unlikely, the combination of immune dysregulation coupled with abnormal tooth development suggested a possible underlying functional defect in NEMO, I\u03baB\u03b1, or a functionally related gene, which could disrupt ectodysplasin signaling and produce the observed dental phenotype. The phenotype prompted targeted sequencing of inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase regulatory subunit gamma (  IKBKG  ), the gene encoding NEMO. A synonymous c.597G>A substitution within exon 5 in   IKBKG   was identified. In silico analyses of the c.597G>A mutation predicted disruption of an exonic splicing enhancer and an exon-identity element in exon 5, which could promote alternative splicing of this exon ( ,  ) (see Methods for analysis details). Indeed, analysis of whole-blood RNA-Seq data revealed an alternative splicing ratio (see Methods) of 56.7% in patient P1, whereas in healthy controls the ratio was 8.5% (95% CI 6.1%\u201311.0%). This transcript had previously been identified in cancer cell lines and healthy control CD4  T cells ( ). We further examined alternative   IKBKG   splicing in a large cohort of patients with autoinflammatory disease and found alternative splicing ratios of 64.3% and 40.1% in 2 additional patients, P2 and P3 ( ). Sanger sequencing of DNA from these 2 male patients revealed 2 de novo single nucleotide changes in the intronic splicing regulatory domain of exon 5, thus identifying 2 additional patients with related genetic polymorphisms and similar clinical features ( , and  ). Whole-genome sequences from all 3 patients, P1, P2, and P3, revealed no other likely disease-causing candidate variants (Methods).   IKBKG   sequencing of maternal DNA indicated that all 3 mutations were de novo. \n\nTo assess the specificity of alternative splicing in cells from patients with splice-site mutations, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on PBMCs of 3 immunodeficient NEMO patients with known loss-of-function mutations, patients P4, P5, and P7. We identified no increase in alternative splicing compared with healthy controls ( ). We next determined whether the alternative splicing in   IKBKG   was confined to hematopoietic immune cells. In patients P1, P2, and P3, a shorter NEMO mRNA splice variant was detected in fibroblasts, with variable levels of the full-length (FL) transcript. Sanger sequencing of the shorter NEMO variant confirmed the same 153 nucleotide deletion of exon 5 in all 3 patients, P1, P2, and P3 ( ). Sequence analysis of the long cDNA variant from P1 cells confirmed the synonymous exon 5 c.597G>A mutation that was identified by Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA ( ). Quantitation of this variant and of the FL transcript by qPCR indicated significantly higher ratios of mutant over FL cDNA in P1\u2013P3 than in healthy controls ( ). Because the splice variant is not captured in public databases, we analyzed whole-genomic variation data from more than 1150 healthy individuals with ethnic backgrounds similar to those of the patients (45.3% southern European, 24.3% pan-European, 18.2% western/northern European), and we failed to detect the 3 presumed pathogenic variants ( ). To confirm that these mutations independently promote loss of exon 5 during mRNA splicing, we constructed a minigene containing   IKBKG   exons 4 to 6 ( ). Whereas transfection with a minigene containing the reference genomic sequence yielded a majority of FL transcript, transfection with minigenes containing mutant sequences from patients P1, P2, and P3 led to recovery of increased amounts of shortened transcript variants ( ). Verification by Sanger sequencing confirmed that the 518 bp amplicon contained sequence-skipping exon 5. The shortened transcript maintained the open reading frame, thus predicting expression of a protein lacking amino acids 174 through 224 of FL-NEMO. We therefore refer to this protein isoform as NEMO-\u0394ex5. To test whether the splice variant generated a stable protein product, we analyzed NEMO protein expression in primary cells from patients P1, P2, and P3. In dermal fibroblasts from patient P1, we observed low levels of FL-NEMO protein expression and high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5, the identity of which we confirmed by mass spectroscopy ( ). Cells from patients P2 and P3 had lower levels of the mutant isoform and higher levels of FL-NEMO compared with P1 ( ). In PBMCs from patients P1, P2, and P3, we also detected NEMO-\u0394ex5, which was not detectable in cells from healthy controls ( ). To understand the effect of NEMO-\u0394ex5 mutation on NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated gene expression, we performed RNA-Seq on whole blood from patients P1\u2013P3, 13 healthy controls, and 10 patients with NOMID, an IL-1\u2013mediated autoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in   NLRP3  . Cells from patients P1\u2013P3 exhibited a markedly enhanced NF-\u03baB response expression profile compared with healthy controls and patients with NOMID ( ). Together, these data demonstrated that these rare   IKBKG   mutations can mediate alternative mRNA splicing and increased expression of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform in patient cells, which is associated with activation of NF-\u03baB response genes. In view of the clinical and molecular features that are distinct from patients with classical EDA-ID but shared with patients with other autoinflammatory diseases, we propose to name this disease   N  EMO   d  eleted exon 5   a  utoinflammatory   s  yndrome (NDAS). \n\n\n### Defective TLR3- and RLR- but not TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in dermal fibroblasts that express high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5. \n  \nThe domain encoded by exon 5 was suggested to mediate interaction of NEMO with TANK, which forms a ternary complex with TBK1 (  and ref.  ). We therefore tested whether NEMO-\u0394ex5 mutant might fail to associate with TBK-1 in cells transfected with NEMO-\u0394ex5, FL-NEMO, or both. Indeed, NEMO-\u0394ex5 pulldown with TANK and associated TBK1 was greatly reduced, even in cells cotransfected with FL-NEMO, in contrast to other previously described patient-derived NEMO mutations (  and  ). To investigate whether impaired NEMO-\u0394ex5 association with TANK could affect TBK1 kinase activity, we tested IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation in response to poly(I:C), a ligand of both TLR3 and the cytosolic RLR family in patients\u2019 dermal fibroblasts. Phosphorylation of IRF3 in response to poly(I:C) was intact ( ). However, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and phosphorylation of the canonical p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB was variably impaired in all 3 patients and correlated with levels of FL-NEMO expression such that the most impaired NF-\u03baB activation was observed in cells from patient P1, whereas cells from patient P3 exhibited a response to poly(I:C) indistinguishable from healthy controls ( ). In response to the prototypical inflammatory cytokine TNF, NEMO-\u0394ex5\u2013expressing patient fibroblasts induced normal I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and p65 phosphorylation ( ). Fibroblasts from P4 (expressing NEMO-C417R) demonstrated impaired NF-\u03baB activation in response to both poly(I:C) and TNF ( ). As an orthogonal measure of NF-\u03baB activation, we measured nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 after TNF and poly(I:C) stimulation. In P1 fibroblasts, nuclear translocation was normal in response to TNF but defective in response to transfected poly(I:C) ( ). We interrogated whether another TLR agonist, LPS, would activate NF-\u03baB in fibroblasts from patients with NDAS compared with control fibroblasts. LPS stimulation led to modestly enhanced NF-\u03baB translocation in fibroblasts from patients compared with healthy controls ( ). To test whether the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform could function to suppress signaling in the presence of FL-NEMO protein, we stably expressed the NEMO-\u0394ex5 form in healthy control fibroblasts, which reduced poly(I:C)-induced NF-\u03baB activation in healthy control cells. Conversely, expression of FL-NEMO rescued the NF-\u03baB activation defect in P1 dermal fibroblasts ( ). These data suggest that the degree of poly(I:C)-induced NF-\u03baB activation was affected by levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 and FL-NEMO. \n\nTo study the consequences of altered activation of NF-\u03baB in fibroblasts expressing NEMO-\u0394ex5, we measured the induction of a set of target genes using NanoString technology and RNA-Seq. TNF-induced gene expression in P1 skin fibroblasts was intact; however, poly(I:C) failed to induce   IFNB1  ,   OAS1  ,   RSAD2  ,   IDO1  , and several other IFN-stimulated genes ( ). In contrast, LPS stimulation led to equivalent expression of the majority of NF-\u03baB response genes ( ). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated enhanced TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling genes in response to LPS signaling in P1 cells compared with healthy control fibroblasts ( ). To determine whether the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform alone was able to propagate TNF- or poly(I:C)-induced signaling leading to NF-\u03baB activation, we retrovirally expressed NEMO-\u0394ex5 in NEMO-deficient cell lines. We were unable to expand primary human dermal fibroblasts from single-cell cultures after NEMO deletion and therefore generated a NEMO-deficient HEK293T cell line to study signal transduction mediated by either isoform in isolation. Whereas NEMO-deficient Jurkat T cells or HEK293T cells were unable to activate NF-\u03baB in response to TNF, expression of either FL-NEMO or NEMO-\u0394ex5 in these cells led to reconstitution of TNF-induced NF-\u03baB pathway activation. In contrast, whereas expression of either NEMO isoform in knockout T cells led to NF-\u03baB activation after poly(I:C) stimulation, NEMO-deficient HEK293T cells reconstituted with FL-NEMO responded to poly(I:C) stimulation with NF-\u03baB activation, but cells expressing NEMO-\u0394ex5 alone did not ( , F and G). However, it is possible that dermal fibroblasts that exclusively express high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 may not exhibit a similar pattern due to cell type\u2013specific signaling differences. \n\nConsistent with impaired induction of gene expression in response to poly(I:C) in patient fibroblasts, secretion of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b1 were reduced ( ). Conversely, TNF-induced production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b1 was intact ( ). To test the impact of altered signaling and cytokine production in the setting of viral infection, we infected patient skin fibroblasts with a GFP reporter strain of human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV3), a single-stranded RNA virus ( \u2013 ). Primary skin fibroblasts or induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived (iPSC-derived) fibroblast-like cells from patients P1, P2, and P3 infected with hPIV3-GFP permitted increased viral protein expression compared with healthy control cells and other NEMO mutant cell lines (  and  ). \n\n\n### NEMO-\u0394ex5 mediates NF-\u03baB activation in immune cells and excess type I IFN production. \n  \nThe reduced antiviral responses in fibroblasts from patients with NDAS would suggest a more severe primary immunodeficiency than has been observed clinically in these patients. We hypothesized that the effects of NEMO mutations in NDAS may be tissue specific and evaluated the effects of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform in immune cells. \n\nWe serially collected independent whole-blood samples from patients P1\u2013P3 and performed RNA-Seq. Analysis of gene expression profiles by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated differential induction of genes in 28 functional pathways, including \u201cacute phase response signaling\u201d and 3 pathways associated with IFN and antiviral signaling in patient P1 ( ). Induction of these pathways was consistent with early observations of an IFN response gene signature in PBMCs from all 3 patients with NDAS. To quantify the expression of IFN response genes, we compared the IFN transcriptional signature in patients P1, P2, and P3 and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a known type I IFN\u2013associated disease, with that of healthy controls ( ). We examined expression of a set of 64 IFN-stimulated genes in peripheral blood from patients P1\u2013P3 obtained throughout the course of their evaluation. The IFN-stimulated genes from patients P1 and P2 and 3 out of 5 samples from P3 were elevated and grossly similar to the expression in patients with SLE ( ). We next sought to determine whether the NDAS class of mutation exhibited gene expression patterns distinct from other previously described NEMO mutations. Because whole-blood samples from patients P4, P5, and P7 were not available, we performed RNA-Seq and gene expression analysis on unstimulated PBMCs previously isolated from these patients, which we compared with similarly isolated samples from patients P1, P2, and P3. GSEA indicated enhanced type I and type II IFN response in NDAS samples compared either with healthy controls or \u201cother NEMO\u201d (i.e., P4, P5, and P7) and conversely, downregulated TNF signaling in other NEMO relative to NDAS samples (  and  ). To quantify increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes, we calculated an IFN score from whole blood, indicating that the mean IFN score of all 3 patients with NDAS was comparable to that of patients with SLE with a range of disease activity ( ,  , and  ). Although samples from patients with NDAS exhibited a mean IFN score similar to that of patients with SLE as a whole, we noted variability in the expression of these genes, particularly for samples taken from patient P3 ( ). To determine whether the IFN score correlated with the extent of alternative exon 5 splicing, we plotted the IFN score against the percentage of alternate splicing of NEMO transcript obtained from patients with NDAS and 15 healthy controls ( ). This analysis indicated a significant correlation between the IFN score and alternative splicing (R  = 0.69,   P <   0.0001). A similarly high correlation with the NF-\u03baB score was found (R  = 0.74   P <   0.001;  ). Samples from patient P3 exhibited a normal IFN score when alternative splicing was low (IFN score = 0.08 with splicing index of 0.28). However, the IFN and NF-\u03baB scores were among the highest of all patients with NDAS when the splicing index approached 50%. We found that alternative splicing of NEMO was also highly correlated to the \u201c3-genes NF-\u03baB/STAT1score\u201d that distinguishes patients with NDAS from those with other type I interferonopathies, such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) and stimulator of IFN genes\u2013associated (STING-associated) vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), and consistent with our NF-\u03baB correlation, the \u201c11-gene NF-\u03baB-only validation score\u201d was also highly correlated with alternative NEMO splicing (  and ref.  ). To directly measure IFN production in cells from patients with NDAS, we stimulated PBMCs from patient P1 with poly(I:C) and measured intracellular cytokine production by intracellular flow cytometry. P1 CD14  cells and CD4  T cells had enhanced type I IFN and STAT1 phosphorylation compared with cells from healthy controls, indicating that IFN induction and signaling pathways were intact (  and  , B, D, and E). These results indicate that in contrast to skin fibroblasts, peripheral blood CD14  and CD4  T cells expressing high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 are responsive to poly(I:C) stimulation and produce an excess of type I IFN. \n\nWe generated T cell and monocyte cell lines that stably expressed FL-NEMO, the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform, or previously described gain-of-function (E391X) or loss-of-function (i.e., C417R) mutants. Unlike the findings in fibroblasts, expression of NEMO-\u0394ex5 in the undifferentiated THP-1 monocytic cell line led to increased constitutive and poly(I:C)-induced p65 phosphorylation compared with WT NEMO (  and  ). NEMO-\u0394ex5\u2013reconstituted cells differentiated with PMA were also more responsive to TLR stimulation than cells expressing FL-NEMO or the known loss-of-function mutant C417R ( ), and both undifferentiated and PMA-differentiated monocytic NEMO-\u0394ex5 mutants secreted increased NF-\u03baB response cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-10 ( ). In Jurkat T cells, transfection with poly(I:C) to target RLRs yielded greater activation of NF-\u03baB in NEMO-\u0394ex5 cells compared with cells expressing FL-NEMO ( ). \n\nThe intact or enhanced IFN response to poly(I:C) in immune cells harboring high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 contrasts with findings in skin fibroblasts ( ) and indicated that haematopoietically derived cells from patients with NDAS may not be similarly susceptible to viral infection in vitro. To test whether the observed enhanced IRF3 response and IFN-stimulated gene expression increased the ability of P1 immune cells to resist viral infection, we cultured primary blasting T cells with hPIV3. In comparison to healthy control cells, P4 (C417R loss of function NEMO) cells were hypersusceptible to hPIV3 infection, whereas P1 cells were less susceptible ( ). \n\n\n### NEMO-\u0394ex5 stabilizes IKKi to enhance NF-\u03baB signaling in immune cells. \n  \nWe investigated potential molecular mechanisms underlying the proinflammatory cytokine and IFN production associated with NEMO-\u0394ex5 expression. We considered the atypical IKK kinases TBK1 and IKKi because they are known to interact with NEMO and have roles in IFN induction ( \u2013 ). Whereas TBK1 is expressed constitutively in several cell types, IKKi has been shown to be induced by activators of NF-\u03baB, such as LPS and PMA, and is constitutively expressed at higher levels in leukocytes compared with skin cells ( ). We detected endogenous IKKi protein in THP-1 cells by Western blot that was further induced in response to PMA and to poly(I:C) ( ). To investigate the interaction between IKKi and NEMO isoforms, we reconstituted FL-NEMO or NEMO-\u0394ex5 in NEMO-deficient HEK293T cells. NEMO-\u0394ex5 readily associated with IKKi when both were expressed at high levels ( ). After stimulation with poly(I:C), IKKi association with FL-NEMO was reduced, even though total levels of transfected IKKi remained stable. In cells expressing NEMO-\u0394ex5, IKKi association persisted in a complex with NEMO after poly(I:C) stimulation ( , quantitation of   n =   3 experiments) \n\nTo determine whether NEMO-\u0394ex5 also associates with and stabilizes the NEMO-IKKi complex in primary T cells, we immunoprecipitated IKKi from T cell blasts from patient P1 and a healthy control with or without poly(I:C) stimulation and detected associated NEMO isoforms by Western blot. FL-NEMO was associated with IKKi in unstimulated healthy control cells ( ). After stimulation with poly(I:C), levels of IKKi-associated FL-NEMO were somewhat reduced ( ). In T cells from patient P1, however, poly(I:C) treatment did not lead to a reduction in IKKi-associated NEMO-\u0394ex5 ( ). In addition, in contrast to cells from healthy controls, FL-NEMO association with IKKi was not reduced in P1 cells after poly(I:C) treatment ( ). Given the high background signal resulting from the limited availability of primary cells from patients, we sought to quantitate the NEMO-IKKi stabilization by an independent method. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) has been used in single-cell measurement of heterotypic protein localization with a theoretical maximum distance of 30 to 40 nanometers ( ,  ). Using 2 antibodies specific to NEMO and IKKi, we detected a NEMO-IKKi PLA association-signal in THP1 cells reconstituted with FL-NEMO and NEMO-\u0394ex5. After stimulation with LMW poly (I:C), NEMO-IKKi complex intensity was reduced 4-fold in cells transduced with FL-NEMO, whereas cells transduced with NEMO-\u0394ex5 maintained a stable NEMO-IKKi complex signal ( ). Individual cell image analysis revealed that the increased PLA signal in NEMO-\u0394ex5 cells was due to larger NEMO/IKKi specs in these cells compared with those expressing FL-NEMO, suggesting oligomerization/aggregation (ref.   and  ). Thus, NEMO-\u0394ex5 can form a complex with IKKi that resists dissociation in response to poly(I:C) signals, which likely contributes to the enhanced NF-\u03baB and IFN scores derived from cells expressing high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 and IKKi. \n\n\n### TNF induces IKKi expression and restores antiviral response in fibroblasts of patients with NDAS. \n  \nThe observation of intact TNFR1 signaling in patient fibroblasts and ability of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform to stabilize the NEMO-IKKi complex and cause hyperresponsiveness to TLR-3/RLR stimulation in immune cells suggested a mechanism by which skin fibroblasts expressing NEMO-\u0394ex5 could acquire enhanced antiviral activity. Using our RNA-Seq data ( ), we examined the subset of TNF- and LPS-induced genes known to be involved in the TLR3/RLR signaling pathway that interact directly or indirectly with NEMO ( , see Methods). We identified   IKBKE  , encoding IKKi, which is activated by TNF and LPS stimulation in a NEMO-dependent manner. We confirmed that TNF and LPS treatment both robustly induced IKKi protein expression in dermal fibroblasts. In contrast, we noted only modest induction of IKKi protein after RSV infection, whereas hPIV3 infection alone did not appear to induce IKKi expression, perhaps because of a recognized virally mediated suppression mechanism (ref.   and  ). We tested whether TNF induction could rescue type-I IFN production in fibroblasts stimulated with poly(I:C) from patient P1. Indeed, TNF restored   IFNB1   expression in dermal fibroblasts treated with poly(I:C) from patient P1, although it had little effect on healthy control cells ( ). \n\nWe tested whether TNF might further enhance IKKi expression in P1 fibroblasts infected with hPIV-3. In contrast to IKKi induction following viral infection alone, infection of skin fibroblasts with hPIV3 in the presence of TNF led to a sustained increase in IKKi protein expression in P1 skin fibroblasts compared with fibroblasts from healthy controls and P4 (NEMO-C417R) ( ). \n\nBecause IKKi can substitute for TBK1 in the alternative IKK complex ( ), we reasoned that expression of IKKi should restore the antiviral immune defect in NDAS dermal fibroblasts. TNF costimulation significantly reduced hPIV3 replication in cells from patients P1\u2013P3 by approximately 30%. In contrast, TNF did not confer resistance to virus replication in P4 fibroblasts harboring the classic loss-of-function NEMO C417R mutant, any of the other control NEMO-mutant fibroblasts, or in cells from healthy controls ( ). To understand the specific role of IKKi induction in the suppression of viral replication, we retrovirally transduced patient and healthy control iPSC-derived fibroblast-like cells to overexpress IKKi ( , A and B). Similar to NDAS patient\u2013derived skin fibroblasts treated with TNF, IKKi-expressing cells from patient P1 demonstrated enhanced ability to resist hPIV3. Two other NEMO mutant controls also suppressed hPIV3 infection when IKKi was overexpressed, suggesting that their lack of TNF responsiveness was related to an inability to upregulate or properly signal in concert with endogenous IKKi ( ). These results suggest that inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF or LPS, can mitigate defective IFN production in NDAS skin fibroblasts expressing high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5, restoring their ability to control viral replication. In addition, IKKi-NEMO complex stabilization in cells that express high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 presents a mechanism to understand the peripheral blood IFN and NF-\u03baB gene signatures and autoinflammatory disease phenotype in these patients. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we describe 3 male patients with a syndrome we term NDAS that arises due to germline mutations in splicing regulatory elements in   IKBKG   encoding NEMO. Patients with NDAS present with uveitis, a predominantly lymphohistiocytic panniculitis, hepatitis, and a striking lack of severe or recurrent infections, which distinguishes them from patients with other clinical syndromes linked to mutations in   IKBKG  . Patients with NDAS are characterized by increased IFN and NF-\u03baB response gene signatures and a lack of cardinal features, such as basal ganglia calcifications, white matter disease, and hypertension seen in other type I interferonopathies ( ,  ). Of additional clinical importance, standard exome filtering algorithms for missense mutations failed to detect all 3 NDAS patient mutations since they were deemed to be silent mutations. Our results thus highlight the need to consider mutations that may lead to alternative splicing and suggest that there may be additional patients with NDAS with mutations affecting   IKBKG   splicing that remain undiagnosed even after exome sequencing. \n\nConsistent with previous studies of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform, ( ,  ), we found that cells from patients with NDAS displayed unique NF-\u03baB signaling features. Whereas NF-\u03baB activation in response to TLR3/RLR stimulation was impaired in NDAS patients\u2019 skin fibroblasts that expressed high levels of the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform, it was intact in patients\u2019 T cells and monocytes. Our results indicate that in contrast to TLR3 stimulation of unprimed skin fibroblasts, TLR3 stimulation of NDAS patient hematopoietic cells with poly(I:C) or by viral infection may lead to enhanced type I IFN production and antiviral responses due to a relatively stabilized NEMO-\u0394ex5-IKKi complex. The ability of TNF-primed NDAS skin fibroblasts to stabilize IKKi levels and resist infection with hPIV3 ( ) is consistent with a role for IKKi in NF-\u03baB activation and innate antiviral immunity ( ,  ,  ,  ). However, IKKi plays a secondary role in negatively regulating type I IFN induction, as bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages (BMDMs) from IKKi knockout mice can produce increased IFN-\u03b2, potentially through RIG-I downregulation ( ,  ). These apparently opposing functions for IKKi in NF-\u03baB and type I IFN signaling have precedent: genetic knockout of TBK1, TANK, and TAK1 can mimic overexpression phenotypes in these signaling pathways ( ,  ,  ). In any event, the negative regulatory functions of IKKi revealed by its deletion do not preclude a positive role for IKKi in TLR3/RLR-induced NF-\u03baB and IFN induction and a critical role for IKKi in cells expressing NEMO-\u0394ex5. \n\nSystemic autoinflammatory disease (SAID) in patients with NDAS may result from, in part, enhanced stability of the NEMO-IKKi complex. Previous work, however, demonstrated impaired association of IKKi with NEMO-\u0394ex5 ( ). Various factors could explain this discrepancy. First, the IKKi-NEMO-\u0394ex5 association may only be detectable when IKKi is expressed at high enough levels such that overexpression of the TANK adapter to bridge the association between NEMO and IKKi is not required. We showed that TNF and TLR ligands led to 10- to 15-fold upregulation of endogenous IKKi protein expression, and under these conditions, IKKi stabilization preferentially occurred in dermal fibroblasts from patients with NDAS ( ). We also found that immune cells (i.e., activated T cells and THP1 monocytes) that constitutively express relatively high levels of endogenous IKKi contain a protein complex comprising IKKi, FL-NEMO, and NEMO-\u0394ex5 ( ). Therefore, one of the mechanisms leading to NEMO-\u0394ex5-IKKi association may simply be increased IKKi protein levels. These transient, low-affinity interactions may be detectable only using optimized high-sensitivity techniques, such as PLA or immunoprecipitation in the presence of deubiquitinase inhibitors ( ). A lower-affinity interaction mediated by polyubiquitin degradation or interactions would be consistent with stimulation-induced \u201ctunable\u201d and transient association, providing a mechanism for immune signaling regulation. \n\nThe stabilized IKKi-NEMO complex we observed in cells expressing high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 might be due to impaired recruitment of ubiquitin modifiers that mediate IKKi-NEMO disassociation or degradation within the signaling complex. In murine alveolar macrophages, NEMO functionally interacts with a degradative E3 ligase, TRIM29, via residues that are absent in NEMO-\u0394ex5 ( ). A signaling complex in which FL-NEMO and NEMO-\u0394ex5 are co-associated, therefore, would potentially lead to stabilization of FL-NEMO in cells that express NEMO-\u0394ex5 after poly(I:C) treatment ( ). Additionally, rather than failure to recruit an E3 ligase that may target IKKi, NEMO-\u0394ex5 may fail to interact in vivo with negative regulators of IFN induction, such as LUBAC ( ). Future work could be directed at identifying whether these or similar candidates are responsible for signaling abnormalities in cells that express high levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5. \n\nIn classical NEMO hypomorphism or IKK-\u03b2 deficiency, TNF leads to increased cell death, disrupting barrier integrity and triggering inflammatory response pathways that result in clinical features, such as colitis, that accompany immunodeficiency ( ,  ). Other kindreds with severe immune deficiency and inflammatory disease have been described with a combination of branch-point mutation and stop-gain mutation in exon 5 ( ,  ,  ). In these previous cases, NEMO-\u0394ex5 protein was detected at low levels with only trace amounts of FL protein expression in patient cells. As a result, these cells were unable to activate NF-\u03baB in response to TNF stimulation, in distinction to NDAS patient\u2013derived cells, which, although exhibiting somewhat less than fully intact p65 phosphorylation, activated p65 sufficiently to permit the TNF-induced NF-\u03baB translocation, gene expression, and protein upregulation of IKKi shown. \n\nConsequently, we did not observe increased cell death after TNF stimulation of cells from patients with NDAS, and infection or colitis were not major clinical features. Our results suggest that sufficient expression of FL-NEMO may be required to develop an NDAS clinical phenotype distinct from the inflammatory disease due to IKK-\u03b2 or NEMO hypomorphism in addition to other branch-point mutations that impair TNF signaling. TNF blockade has been a relatively effective treatment for 2 patients with NDAS (P1 and P3; ref.  ). Because of the potentiating effect of TNF on IKKi induction and the specific stabilization of IKKi by NEMO-\u0394ex5, our results provide a mechanism by which TNF blockade may reduce excess NF-\u03baB activity and inflammatory disease in patients with NDAS. Alternatively, the enhanced IFN gene expression signature found in NDAS suggests that blocking IFN receptor signaling may be beneficial. In contrast to other NEMO mutants, the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform possesses an intact N-terminal domain, UBAN, and ZF domains that would permit association with IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2, K63-, and M1-linked polyubiquitin, respectively, which may explain its ability to activate NF-\u03baB in response to TNF and LPS ( ,  ). Consequently, NEMO-\u0394ex5 differs from other NEMO mutants with impaired TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation or that fail to stabilize the NEMO-IKKi complex ( ,  , D and E, and ref.  ). Constitutively intact NF-\u03baB function in NDAS patient hematopoietic cells or in skin fibroblasts after LPS or TNF signaling may account for the unique phenotype of systemic inflammatory disease without apparent increased susceptibility to viral or bacterial infection found clinically. Altered NF-\u03baB signaling during development can lead to mild features of ectodermal dysplasia, such as conical teeth, which are likely due to impaired ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) signaling in these patients ( ). The CNS involvement in NDAS differs from genetic TLR or RLR deficiencies leading to developmental disorders affecting bone and brain ( \u2013 ) in that cognitive development was grossly intact in patients with NDAS, even though CNS venous thrombosis occurred in 2 of 3 patients. As more patients are identified and systematically evaluated, a more complete understanding of the phenotypic spectrum in NDAS will likely emerge. \n\nThe mutations found in patients P1 and P2 lead to the expression of reduced levels of FL-NEMO in skin fibroblasts and failure to fully activate NF-\u03baB in response to poly(I:C). Impaired poly(I:C)-induced NF-\u03baB signaling coupled with intact TNF signaling was a pattern observed in fibroblasts from patients P1 and P2 and from NEMO patient P7 harboring NEMO E315A within the UBAN ubiquitin recognition domain that is involved in TLR3- and RLR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and antiviral responses (  and refs.  ,  ,  ). The intermediate responsiveness of P7 cells to TNF costimulation after hPIV3 infection ( ) suggests that TNF-mediated antiviral effects in NDAS cells rely on a unique combination of NF-\u03baB activation that leads to induced IKKi expression coupled with IKKi stabilization that is specifically mediated by the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform. Since the defect in poly(I:C)-induced NF-\u03baB activation in P1 cells could be rescued by overexpression of FL-NEMO ( ), we would expect that P2 cells with higher levels of FL-NEMO and lower levels of NEMO-\u0394ex5 expression would also be rescued by increasing expression of FL-NEMO. The ability to suppress normal signaling or rescue impaired signaling by overexpression suggests that variation in the ratio of FL-NEMO to NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoforms or altering absolute levels of these isoforms regulates NF-\u03baB activation. \n\nAfter poly(I:C) stimulation of NDAS dermal fibroblasts, we observed phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser386, although gene expression and cytokine production were impaired. Cells lacking NEMO or those reconstituted with NEMO-\u0394ex5 alone fail to induce IRF3 dimerization and type I and type III IFN production in response to poly(I:C) ( ,  ). Therefore, it appears that expression levels of FL-NEMO in NDAS cells are sufficient to enable poly(I:C)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, but not NF-\u03baB activation in response to poly(I:C), which is consistent with impaired IFN-\u03b2 induction and diminished resistance to RNA virus replication in cells ( ). Full IRF3 activation, like NF-\u03baB activation, requires additional stimulation-induced posttranslational modifications that enable DNA binding, interaction with other transcription machinery, and normal gene expression. Given the cross-phosphorylation that occurs between the canonical IKK and the atypical IKK kinases and their substrates, it is possible that IRF3 posttranslational modifications other than S386 are dysregulated ( ). \n\nThis raises the important question of how much NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform expression is required to develop a clinical phenotype. Although this cannot be determined from the present study, our results suggest that even relatively low expression of NEMO-\u0394ex5 together with a low or normal expression of FL-NEMO may be sufficient. We note that \u201clow\u201d expression of NEMO-\u0394ex5 in P3 skin fibroblasts is low only in comparison to the amount of FL-NEMO expressed. However, NEMO-\u0394ex5 levels in NDAS patient cells was substantially more than that expressed by healthy control cells. Patient P3\u2019s clinical phenotype seemed as severe as that of patients P1 and P2, although the skin fibroblast NEMO-\u0394ex5/FL-NEMO ratio was lower and peripheral blood alternative splicing was on some occasions within the normal range ( ). One possible explanation is that variable expression of NEMO-\u0394ex5 in peripheral blood with transcript levels that can approach the normal range at times may be sufficient for pathological peripheral immune cell activation and gene expression resulting in a clinical disease phenotype. \n\nGiven the limitations in sample availability, we were unable to perform all experiments using cells from patients P2 and P3. Despite the strong association between the peripheral blood gene signature and disease phenotype, it is possible that some of the findings from P1 cells, such as reduced susceptibility to viral infection ( ), cytokine production ( ), and IKKi stabilization (  and  ) do not occur in cells with lower levels of alternative splicing. Although we cannot be certain that the degree of primary immune deficiency (PID) or inflammation correlates with amount of FL-NEMO or NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform expressed, as more patients with NDAS are discovered and systematically studied, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of how relative levels affect the various possible roles and functions of this protein. We anticipate that future studies using compounds that modulate isoform expression in small animal models will enable a determination of the lowest amount of NEMO-\u0394ex5 expression that leads to disease and altered immune function. Additionally, as the NEMO-\u0394ex5 isoform is expressed in cells without   IKBKG   mutation, our results raise the possibility that monitoring and controlling exon 5 mRNA splicing may regulate innate immunity to pathogens and autoinflammatory disease in humans. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Primary cell isolation, sequencing, and cell stimulation. \n  \nCultured dermal fibroblasts were obtained from collagenase type IV treatment of forearm skin biopsies. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation. T cell blasts were generated by stimulation of total PBMCs with Concanavalin-A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 hours and expanded in IL-2 (NCI Preclinical Repository). PBMC subsets were isolated through positive selection using the AutoMACS Pro (Miltenyi Biotec) and anti-CD14 microbeads, anti-CD4\u2013phycoerytherin (anti-CD4\u2013PE) with anti-PE microbeads, and anti-CD8 FITC with anti-FITC microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). For sequencing preparation, total RNA was harvested from primary cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). Sanger sequencing of cDNA was performed using appropriate primers. For cell stimulations, the following reagents were utilized: poly(I:C) (Sigma-Aldrich), low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C) (InvivoGen), Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), and recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 (R&D Systems). Skin fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/mL poly(I:C) alone [poly(I:C)] or along with transfection reagent, Lipofectamine [t-poly(I:C)]. TNF dose used for stimulation was 20 ng/mL unless otherwise specified. \n\n\n### Viral infection assay. \n  \nAdherent cells were infected with hPIV3-GFP and viral protein expression was measured by acquiring serial images using a brightfield and green filters for GFP. AUC of total GFP intensity per cell was measured and within-experiment normalization to healthy control samples was performed. \n\n\n### Cell lines. \n  \nNEMO-WT and NEMO-\u0394ex5 T cell lines were generated through reconstitution of the NEMO-deficient Jurkat line 8321, provided by A. Ting (Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York, NY). Stable reconstitution of Jurkat and THP1-dual cells (InvivoGen) was performed using the Phoenix helper-free retrovirus producer lines as described previously ( ). Phoenix cells were transfected with Migr1 plasmids containing FL-NEMO or NEMO-\u0394 ex5 cDNA sequences and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) GFP sequence. Two days later, virus was harvested and used to transduce Jurkat line 8321. GFP  NEMO-reconstituted cells were selected by FACS. For transient transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC), X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection reagent (Roche) was utilized to deliver Migr1 plasmids containing FL or NEMO-\u0394ex5 cDNA sequence. Biochemical experiments were performed 48 hours after transfection. iPSC-derived fibroblast-like lines were generated using episomal expression plasmids to generate iPSCs and then cultured in SB/E6 media ( ). \n\n\n### IKKi shRNA knockdown and overexpression. \n  \nPatient and healthy control iPSC-derived fibroblast-like cells were lentivirally transduced. IKKi gene was subcloned into a lentiviral vector, pLVX-IRES-mCherry (Takara), and transfected into Lenti-X HEK293T cells (Takara) with Lenti-X Packaging Single Shots (Takara). Two days later, supernatants were collected and passed through a 0.22 \u03bcM filter. Lentivirus titer was measured with Lenti-X GoStix kit (Takara). \n\n\n### p65 staining in primary dermal fibroblasts and PMA-differentiated THP1 cells. \n  \nTwenty-four hours prior to stimulation, primary fibroblasts were trypsinized and plated onto Millicell EZ slides (MilliporeSigma). After stimulation, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in saponin (0.1%). Blocking was performed with 5% goat serum and stained with anti-p65 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-372) overnight and Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen, A27034) for 1 hour prior to mounting in ProLong Gold with DAPI (Life Technologies) overnight. Cells were then imaged using the BZ-9000 series Biorevo 20\u00d7 objective (Keyence). Quantitation of nuclear p65 intensity was performed using ImageJ without normalization to total p65 ( ). \n\nNEMO-reconstituted THP1 cells were treated with 2 \u03bcM PMA (MP Biomedicals) for 72 hours. Media was aspirated and incubated in PBS with or without 10 ng/mL LPS for indicated times. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde solution, permeabilized with perm/wash 1 buffer (BD Biosciences, 557885), and stained with anti-p65 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-372) and Alexa Fluor 568\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen, A11011). Reconstituted cells were identified by GFP signal. Nuclei were stained with Syto21 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S7556). Cells were imaged with IncuCyte S3 10\u00d7 objective (Essen Bioscience) and coincident object analysis using integrated software. \n\n\n### CBA assay in undifferentiated/PMA-differentiated THP1 cells. \n  \nNEMO-reconstituted THP1 cells were treated with 10 ng/mL PMA for 72 hours, and then rested for 24 hours in PMA-free complete D10 media. Cells were treated with 10 \u03bcg/mL HMW poly(I:C) for 72 hours, and then the supernatants were collected. Undifferentiated THP1 cells were rested for 3 hours in complete R10 and treated with 10 \u03bcg/mL HMW poly(I:C) for 20 hours, at which point supernatants were collected. Cytokines were measured from the supernatants using the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Human Inflammatory Cytokines kit (BD Biosciences, 551811), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \n\n\n### PLA/PLIC. \n  \nNEMO-reconstituted THP1 cells were treated with HMW poly(I:C) or carrier. The samples were fixed as above and stained with anti-IKKi (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, 3416) and anti-NEMO (1:200, BD Biosciences, 611306) blocked with 5% donkey serum and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit plus and anti-mouse minus probes (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92002, DUO92004) in situ detection reagent red (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92008) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images were acquired with multispectral imaging flow cytometry (40\u00d7 and 60\u00d7 objectives, ImageStream X Mark II flow cytometer, Amnis/EMD-Millipore), compensated, and processed using IDEAS software (Amnis). In focus, single cells were gated using area, aspect ratio, and gradient root mean squared, channel 01 (RMS Ch01). Stained cells were gated to exclude false positive signal ( ); PLA  specs were identified using R3 Bright Detail Intensity, corresponding to a 3-pixel signal radius. For area analysis, the 20\u00d7 objective of an IncuCyte S3 (Essen) was used to acquire images, and analysis was done with IncuCyte software. \n\n\n### Minigene system. \n  \nFor minigene construction, a segment of genomic DNA spanning   IKBKG   exon 3 to exon 7 was amplified from patient- and healthy control\u2013derived fibroblasts using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Blunt-ended PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen), subcloned into pCMV6-Entry vector (OriGene), and sequence-verified for use as minigenes. These vectors were sequence-verified to contain WT or patient   IKBKG   sequence. Minigene vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells using X-tremeGENE DNA Transfection reagent (Roche), and RNA was harvested 12 hours later using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). After cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen), PCR was performed using appropriate primers to selectively amplify the exogenous NEMO transcript from the minigene. \n\n\n### IPA analysis. \n  \nA TLR3/RLR/IRF3 gene list was generated by selecting all 3 terms, using the \u201cgrow\u201d function, and limiting terms to \u201cexperimentally observed.\u201d Filtering for TLR3/RLR/IRF3 was limited to \u201cexpression\u201d and \u201ctranscription\u201d and for NEMO interaction to \u201cprotein:protein.\u201d The IPA definition of \u201cdirect interaction\u201d was used, which encompasses physical association and chemical changes, such as phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, or degradation. Terms returned that corresponded to chemical compounds were excluded. \n\n\n### Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing variant analysis. \n  \nGene variants detected in 185 known PID- and SAID-associated genes from patients P1\u2013P3 were filtered by allele frequency in dbsnp and exac (<0.01), PolyPhen-2, Provean, and SIFT prediction and assuming X-linked, autosomal dominant de novo, or autosomal recessive inheritance. \n\n\n### Healthy cohort allele frequency. \n  \nWhole-genome sequence profiles of a healthy adult cohort with no record of genetic disease (  n =   1197) were used to assess reference base frequency at the 3 mutation sites observed in affected patients. Blood-derived genomic DNA samples from subjects were used as input for TruSeq PCR-free library preparation before whole-genome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq X platforms by single library, single-lane topography. The healthy cohort was composed of 1158 individuals of European descent, 8 individuals of African descent, 17 individuals of east Asian descent, and 14 Individuals of admixed American descent as defined by the 1000 Genomes super population classifications. \n\nGiven the genomic complexity of the   IKBKG   gene and its high degree of similarity to the adjacent region and   IKBKGP1   pseudogene, read-mapping quality scores were unreliable for alignment assessment. As a result, standard pipeline single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was unavailable to provide an accurate representation for   IKBKG   variation distinct from   IKBKGP1  . To better understand the variation within a healthy cohort compared with affected patients, we measured base identity aligning to each locus within an individual without filtering for mapping quality of the read. Any read overlapping the   IKBKG   variant site and the homologous   IKBKGP1   was included, based on the observation that any read may equally align to the 2 sites due to the pair\u2019s total sequence identity. Individual base calls with a PHRED score below 30 were excluded from the counts. Only individuals with at least 20 total reads overlapping the loci were included in the analysis. \n\n\n### Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot. \n  \nCells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl , 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 250 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 500 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium molybdate, 20 mM EGTA, 5 mM N-ethyl maleimide, 5 mM iodoacetamide, and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche). Insoluble cellular material was removed by centrifugation and immunoprecipitation was performed with appropriate antibodies and Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies). Western immunoblot was performed as previously described ( ) using the following antibodies: p-Ser536-p65 (Cell Signaling Technology, 3033); NEMO (Santa Cruz, sc-8330; BD Biosciences, 611306); p65 (Santa Cruz, sc-372); I\u03baB\u03b1 (Santa Cruz, sc-371); p-Ser32/36-I\u03baB\u03b1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9246); ACTIN (Abcam, ab3280); B-tubulin (Abcam, ab6046); TBK1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 3013); TANK (Cell Signaling Technology, 2141); p-Ser386-IRF3 (Abcam, ab76493); p-Ser396-IRF3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4947). \n\n\n### NEMO exon 5 splicing analysis. \n  \nThe percentage of alternate splicing (%AS) of NEMO transcripts derived by RNA-Seq was defined as the ratio of mapped transcripts overlapping both exons 4 and 6 (4|6) to those overlapping both exons 4 and 5 (4|5), such that %AS = [(count 4|6) /(count 4|5)]. Indexed BAM files were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute). For analysis of the predicted effect of mutations on splicing, the relevant sequence was uploaded to Human Splicing Finder version 3.1 ( ; ref.  ). \n\n\n### Gene expression. \n  \nPAXgene tubes were used to collect RNA from patient and control whole blood. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using the iScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad) with appropriate primers and probes (Life Technologies). Multiplex quantitative gene expression measurements were obtained using the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString), utilizing a custom design CodeSet. For RNA-Seq, first- and second-strand cDNA was synthesized using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). FastQ files were generated using CASAVA 1.8.2 and mapped to hg19 using Tophat 2.1.0. Hemoglobin and intergenic reads were removed using bedtools intersectBed. Reads per kb of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) values were calculated using Partek GS 6.6. Differential gene expression was conducted using DESeq2 in R using raw count data, the outputs of which include the FDR-adjusted   P   value of differential expression between a pair of conditions, as well as fold change for each gene. RPKM values were transformed to   Z   scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of a set of healthy controls (  n =   15).   Z   scores were subjected to hierarchical clustering and plotting of heatmaps using Morpheus (Broad Institute, MIT). The IFN response gene list was based on expression differences between CANDLE and SAVI patient samples versus NOMID and healthy controls, selecting genes based on IPA classification of IFN-regulated genes. The NF-\u03baB response gene list was derived from intersecting the Gilmore Lab (Biology Department, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) NF-\u03baB target gene list and IPA experimentally observed results in humans. \n\n\n### Cytokine measurement. \n  \nAfter stimulation of fibroblasts, culture supernatants were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. The concentrations of type I IFN and cytokines in the supernatants were assayed using the VeriPlex Human Cytokine 16-Plex ELISA Kit (PBL Assay Science) and the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). For cytokine measurements from serum and PBMC supernatants, the Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex assay (Bio-Rad) was utilized. For intracellular flow cytometry staining, IFN-\u03b1 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130092602), IFN-\u03b2 (PBL Assay Science, IFN 21400-3), IFN-\u03b3 (BD Biosciences, 554701), and p-STAT1 (BD Biosciences, 560310). \n\n\n### Statistics. \n  \nGrouped experimental data are represented with mean \u00b1 SEM or when appropriate SD, as indicated in figure legends. Additional relevant statistical methods are described in the corresponding figure legends. Statistical analyses and graphing were done using GraphPad Prism, version 9. Outlier identification was performed using the robust regression and outlier removal (ROUT) method with   Q   = 0.5. Statistical comparisons between 2 groups were performed using 2-tailed Student\u2019s   t   test unless otherwise stated. Other statistical analyses were performed using 1-way or 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey\u2019s, Dunnett\u2019s, or Bonferroni\u2019s corrections for multiple-comparison testing. A   P   value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate a significant difference between groups. For GSEA, the FDR was set to 0.05. \n\n\n### Study approval and clinical trial details. \n  \nThe experimental protocol was approved by the IRB for Human Research at the NIH and Indiana University School of Medicine. For all patients and healthy controls enrolled, written informed consent was obtained in accordance with an NIH IRB-approved protocol. Patients were enrolled in trials NCT00001788, NCT00001372, and NCT02974595 (ClinicalTrials.gov). \n\n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nAWW, YL, JX, JGR, EL, SMK, APH, JZR, CE, AADJ, DNH, DGPP, BL, and EPH conducted experiments for this article.

Age, and its associated physiological and pathological consequences, exacerbate CVD incidence and progression, while modulation of biological age with interventions track with cardiovascular health. Despite the strong link between aging and CVD, surprisingly few studies have directly investigated heart failure and vascular dysfunction in aged models and subjects. Nevertheless, strong correlations have been found between heart disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, fibrosis, and regeneration efficiency with senescent cell burden and its proinflammatory sequelae. In agreement, senotherapeutics have had success in reducing the detrimental effects in experimental models of cardiovascular aging and disease. Aside from senotherapeutics, cellular reprogramming strategies targeting epigenetic enzymes remain an unexplored yet viable option for reversing or delaying CVD. Epigenetic alterations comprising local and global changes in DNA and histone modifications, transcription factor binding, disorganization of the nuclear lamina, and misfolding of the genome are hallmarks of aging. Limited studies in the aging cardiovascular system of murine models or human patient samples have identified strong correlations between the epigenome, age, and senescence. Here, we compile the findings in published studies linking epigenetic changes to CVD and identify clear themes of epigenetic deregulation during aging. Pending direct investigation of these general mechanisms in aged tissues, this review predicts that future work will establish epigenetic rejuvenation as a potent method to delay CVD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiomyopathy, remains the leading cause of death worldwide and carries a severe socioeconomic burden. While many factors contribute to CVD development, including diet, genetics, and the environment, one core, independent risk factor amongst almost everyone with a CVD is aging. It was once estimated that by 2030, about 20% of the United States population would be aged 65 or older and that CVD will account for 40% of the deaths of that group, making CVD the leading cause of death . According to the United States Census Bureau, we have observed an increase in the elderly population from 40 million in 2007 to 51 million in 2017, with the projected number of people over 65 to leap to 95 million in 2060. CVD prevalence continues to increase as human life expectancy also continues to rise, likely due to greater exposure to the traditional external risk factors and intrinsic pathways of aging . After adjusting for the other major risk factors for CVD, one study found the odds of vascular diseases increased with every decade of life, demonstrating a strong increase in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), carotid artery stenosis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with advanced age . \n\nThe pathological consequences associated with normal cardiovascular aging include hypertrophy, altered left ventricular (LV) diastolic and systolic function, heart failure, enhanced arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which can alter the structure and function of the heart and arterial system . In the vasculature specifically, aging contributes to decreasing vascular compliance. Furthermore, it promotes vascular remodeling, including calcification and fibrosis, which in turn precedes the development of hypertension and accelerates the progression of other vascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis or heart failure . In addition, the incidence of metabolic diseases such as diabetes also increases significantly with age and contributes greatly to CVD morbidities and mortalities . Interestingly, many metabolic disorders are associated with premature aging, suggesting that there are mechanisms we can unravel to potentially intervene and prevent the deterioration of the cardiovascular system independent of natural aging. \n\nUntil recently, aging has widely been considered an unmodifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases (cancer and neurodegenerative diseases) and very prominently CVDs . Aging interventions have become a rising area of interest, where molecular and clinical dissection of aging processes have begun to show promising therapeutic targets. The monumental finding in 1939 that caloric restriction (CR) in mice and rats, and most recently in primates, extended lifespan led to the important hypothesis that lifespan extension with delayed aging improved healthspan . Since then, an examination of healthy aging and processes that promote age-related deterioration across species and organs has increased our understanding of the involvement of aging in chronic diseases . \n\n\n## THE ROLE OF SENESCENT CELLS IN CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGIES AND AGE-RELATED PATHWAYS \n  \n### CVD and cellular senescence \n  \nA major contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction was found to be the accumulation of senescent cells in tissues . Senescent cells were discovered in 1965 by Hayflick  as cells with a limited proliferative capacity; however, we now define senescence as those cells with indefinite cell cycle arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and expression of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) . Thus, senescent cells provide a new avenue for therapeutic interventions, known as senotherapies . Specifically, a class of drugs known as \u201csenolytics\u201d is designed to take advantage of the senescent cell\u2019s resistance to apoptosis by targeting cell survival pathways to eliminate senescent cells from tissue selectively, thereby removing their detrimental effects . Alternatively, another class of drugs known as \u201csenostatics\u201d is designed to modulate the proinflammatory SASP; however, the complex composition of the SASP varies widely among different cell types, different stages of senescence (early, middle, or late), and various senescence inducers, providing many obstacles to a successful therapeutic intervention . While the components of the SASP may vary, the beneficial effects of senotherapies (both senolytics and senostatics) are mostly attributed to blunting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling proteins, among others secreted by senescent cells . For a more detailed discussion of these senotherapeutic agents, please consult the reviews by Kirkland and Tchkonia , 2020 and Robbins   et al  . , 2021. \n\nThere is a rapidly growing body of evidence supporting the deleterious role of senescent cells in several CVDs. During embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and wound healing, vascular senescent cells have a beneficial presence to maintain homeostasis ; however, we have learned that impaired removal and accumulation of senescent cells in cardiovascular tissue foments impaired function and disease development. Senescent cells have been implicated in several CVD pathologies, most notably, atherosclerosis , AAA , cardiac fibrosis , heart failure , and hypertension . Further incriminating senescent cells as causative agents of CVD, Childs   et al  .  demonstrated that senescent cells are critical drivers of atherosclerosis and selective removal of these cells has therapeutic potential to improve disease outcomes. In the same year, Roos   et al.  , found that pharmacological clearance of senescent cells can lessen the vasomotor dysfunction that occurs in murine aging and atherosclerosis. \n\n\n### Senescent cardiomyocytes contribute to cardiac pathologies \n  \nHeart failure is an age-related cardiac pathology that is a major source of mortality, affecting approximately 1% of all people over 50 years and doubling its prevalence with each decade of life . Cardiomyocyte senescence is common in cardiac aging and related diseases, although senescent cardiomyocytes are more difficult to identify due to their terminally differentiated state . Senescent cardiomyocytes display contractile dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, DNA damage, genomic instability, declining mitochondrial function, SASP, and hypertrophic growth . Further, the exact triggers and effects of cardiomyocyte senescence   in vivo   have not been well described. However, studies in mice and rats have identified many of the signatures of cellular senescence, such as increased cardiomyocyte size, telomere attrition, ROS production, and elevated senescence markers p16 (CDKN2A) and p53 (TP53) . In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, cardiomyocytes with DNA damage also had the shortest telomeres, and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy also displayed shortened telomere length . While senescence is often associated with telomere shortening, cardiomyocytes are post-mitotic cells that do not experience replicative exhaustion; therefore, senescent cardiomyocytes demonstrate length-independent telomere damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS . As mentioned above, hypertrophy is a hallmark of age-associated heart dysfunction, and although cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth is commonly associated with senescence, it is unclear whether senescent myocyte growth directly contributes to cardiac hypertrophy . A few studies have found that ER stress appears to promote a hypertrophic cardiomyocyte phenotype   in vitro  , hypertrophy was detected in hearts post-infarction, and aged rat hearts demonstrated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased LV fibrosis; however, none of these studies directly measured senescence . Interestingly, treatment of aged mice with the senolytic drug navitoclax selectively removed senescent cardiomyocytes, which improved myocardial remodeling and increased survival following myocardial infarction . While studies have outlined that accumulated damage to mitochondria, proteins, and DNA with age contributes to cardiomyocyte malfunction, telomere damage and cellular senescence are also critical to heart failure in humans, and more efforts will be needed to fully elucidate the contribution of senescent cardiomyocytes to age-related cardiac pathologies . \n\nFurther, cardiomyocyte senescence and the downstream pathologies are also the results of stress-induced premature senescence. Cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin demonstrated similar characteristics to those of aged rats, including increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positive cells, reduced telomerase activity, and increased expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p16 and p21 (CDKN1A) . Recently, Mitry   et al  . , further described the mechanism by which doxorubicin accelerates cardiomyocyte senescence and cardiotoxicity. In the study, Mitry   et al  .  found that doxorubicin caused early and persistent topoisomerase-induced mtDNA damage that enhanced cardiomyocyte senescence, in turn straining the heart\u2019s aerobic metabolism over time and promoting late-onset heart failure often observed in survivors of childhood cancers. \n\nAside from cardiomyocytes, other cardiac cells promote senescence and aging and the downstream age-related diseases. For example, cardiac fibroblasts secrete many paracrine factors such as matrix metalloproteinases and express integrins to promote signaling and ECM interactions that regulate cardiomyocyte senescence . Endothelial cell senescence has also been implicated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, in which the activation of p53 signaling generates cardiac inflammation and left ventricular pressure overload in mice . Interestingly, cardiomyocyte dysfunction can also promote changes in neighboring cell types, such as fibroblasts, and impair the reparative function of cardiac fibrosis after cardiomyocyte injury . \n\nAn important area of study for cardiac aging is impaired cardiomyocyte regeneration. We have discussed the key hallmark of cardiac aging; the increased size of cardiomyocytes, but another critical change is the loss of cardiomyocytes with age . While the neonatal heart demonstrates regenerative capacity, it was long thought the adult heart lacked the ability to renew cardiomyocytes . Recent observations that adult cardiomyocytes renew at a rate of 0.5% to 2% per year demonstrating a limited, innate regenerative ability that has dismantled those previous theories; however, the capacity of the heart to regenerate declines with age . Increased cardiomyocyte death, even in the very small numbers, was shown experimentally to promote heart failure, and that inhibiting the loss of cardiomyocytes, potentially through regeneration, could be an ideal therapeutic avenue . The heart regeneration field suffers from a lack of consistent and reproducible data on the subject; however, a consensus has developed that stem cells are not the source of cardiomyogenesis, but rather preexisting cardiomyocytes divide to give rise to new cells . A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive cardiomyocyte death with age may yield therapeutic potential for promoting regeneration in aged and damaged hearts. \n\n\n### Senescent vascular cells contribute to vascular diseases of aging \n  \nAmong the many changes observed with aging, arterial remodeling and dysfunction are critical to the development of CVD, even in individuals who may be deemed healthy by all other standards. For example, aged arteries are defined by an increased ratio of intima-to-media thickness, and multiple reports have determined a 2- to 3-fold increase in intima thickness between 20- and 90-year-old people . In addition, changes in the arterial wall feature increased collagen synthesis and elastin degradation with age, promoting arterial stiffness and reduced elasticity . The consequence of such vascular remodeling manifests as increased blood pressure and lower diastolic pressure generating a predisposition to developing hypertension and atherosclerosis, among other vascular diseases . \n\nBoth of the primary cell types of the artery, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), become senescent with age, regardless of the presence of a vascular-related disorder . The human VSMCs from aged vessels and advanced-stage atherosclerotic plaques displayed senescence indicators with prolonged population doubling times and reduced cell proliferation . These findings were corroborated by associating the growth arrest of VSMCs with increased expression of p16 and p21, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and RB1 phosphorylation, all of which are observed during replicative VSMC senescence and are widely considered hallmarks of senescence . The VSMCs from the fibrous cap region of the atherosclerotic plaque compared to the vascular media demonstrated telomere shortening caused by oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. The resulting VSMC senescence accelerates vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis . Angiotensin II is another well-described driver of VSMC senescence, and recently, smooth muscle 22\u03b1, an actin-binding protein, has been shown to prevent p53 degradation via MDM2 suppression to promote angiotensin II-induced VSMC senescence . Importantly, senescent VSMCs in the plaque of carotid arteries express enhanced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), signifying VSMCs as a SASP producer and source of inflammation during vascular disease . Most recently, Uryga   et al  .  suggested persistent telomere damage in VSMCs causes senescence and inflammation via immune cell recruitment and retention. Overall, senescent VSMCs have been recognized in atherosclerotic lesions, AAA, and PAD, suggesting that VSMCs have a critical role in age-related vascular pathologies . \n\nAside from VSMCs, ECs play an influential role in vascular disorders with age. While ECs typically maintain vascular homeostasis, senescent or dysfunctional ECs establish proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictor characteristics in addition to reduced proliferation and migration. Replicative senescent ECs express increased cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase and activity, caused by telomere shortening . Another cause of EC senescence may be disturbed flow during atherosclerosis. In both mice and   in vitro  , the aberrant flow was a driver of EC senescence by activating the p21-p53 pathway . Aged and senescent ECs are also producers of inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which also suggests that the accumulation of senescent ECs in the artery with age causes chronic sterile inflammation and vascular changes that predispose one to vascular diseases . \n\nAlthough VSMCs and ECs compose most of the artery, immune cell aging and senescence may also contribute greatly to vascular pathologies associated with aging. Individuals 60 years or older with shortened telomeres in leukocytes experience a higher mortality rate that has been linked to increased death from CVD . In an interesting and clinically relevant study, the analysis of leukocyte populations led to the finding that telomere length was strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis and CVD . Furthermore, senescent leukocytes and senescent effector memory T cells were found preferentially in unstable atherosclerotic plaques . Additionally, enhanced cytokine expression (TNF, MCP-1/CCL2, IL6) and ROS production have been observed in monocytes from atherosclerosis patients . Importantly, the proinflammatory phenotype of aged and senescent monocytes is driven by senescence .   summarizes the known consequences of cardiovascular aging and the molecular mechanisms, cell types, environmental factors involved, and potential therapeutics and interventions. \n\nOverall, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need to continue to study aging and senescence in CVD. Here, we present the body of work thus far that has uncovered numerous important pathways and mechanisms by which aged and senescent cells contribute to the development of different cardiovascular pathologies. Recurring thematic features of cardiovascular aging and disease suggest an unstable genome with shortened telomeres and a deregulated transcriptome that is pro-fibrotic, proinflammatory, but anti-proliferative with reduced regenerative capacity. In sum, these cellular phenotypes suggest an altered epigenome that has emerged as one of the hallmarks of aging in recent years. By focusing on mechanisms with druggable targets such as epigenetic alterations, we can develop therapies to modulate aging and senescence in CVD. Outlined below are the central findings from studies that have investigated epigenetic changes in CVD, although as discussed in  , these studies are limited and mostly out of context with aging. Nevertheless, these studies have revealed important insights that can be validated and developed into targeted therapeutics in the future. \n\n\n\n## EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN THE AGING CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM \n  \nEpigenetic alterations are one of the key features of aging and age-related disease, including CVD. These alterations include changes in DNA modifications, histone modifications, histone composition, transcription factor (TF) binding, non-coding RNA-mediated regulation, chromatin remodeling, nucleosome positioning, and 3D genome folding . Whether epigenetic changes drive aging or are a consequence of activated stress signaling pathways remains to be dissected but likely are part of a vicious cycle that ultimately leads to tissue damage, inflammation, and disease. In the following sections, we first discuss the probable impact of diet, exercise, and other environmental factors on cardiovascular health and then elaborate on the role of specific epigenetic regulators studied in the context of cardiovascular aging and disease. \n\n### Effect of diet, exercise, and other environmental factors in cardiovascular health \n  \nAside from age, obesity and metabolic syndrome (characterized by sarcopenic obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation,   etc  .) are also major risk factors for CVD, partly due to their systemic proinflammatory effects, much like in aging . With increased body mass, there is an increase in the overall size of the heart, concentric hypertrophy, increased left ventricular mass, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction, partially overlapping age-related cardiac symptoms. CR (i.e., a reduction in daily calorie intake without malnutrition) is one of the most reproducible lifestyle interventions that improve cardiovascular health and increase lifespan in multiple models . Studies in non-human primates show that rhesus monkeys on long-term, moderate CR show improvements in metabolic syndrome, including decreased body weight primarily due to loss of fat, decreased visceral fat mass, improved insulin sensitivity, and an altered lipid profile with more cardioprotective high-density lipoprotein compared to ad libitum fed controls . Interestingly, an inadvertent CR in humans participating in the Biosphere 2 experiment showed tremendous cardiovascular health benefits . \n\nMuch like CR, exercise has demonstrated effects on cardiovascular health. Physical inactivity is a major contributing factor to age-related disabilities, declining heart health, stroke, cognitive impairment, and frailty primarily due to progressive arterial stiffness . Older individuals undergoing regular exercise show increased maximal oxygen consumption rate (VO ) . Endurance exercise improves not only VO  but also early diastolic left ventricular filling and relaxation, peak ejection fraction, and cardiac output. There are also general improvements in vascular physiology and endothelial function . \n\nUnlike CR and exercise that have health benefits, smoking is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Smoking is often quantified in \u201cpack-years\u201d, i.e., the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years an individual has smoked ( ). In a study of > 13000 participants, Ding   et al  .  determined a strong correlation between pack-years, duration, intensity, and cessation time of smoking to deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, with the strongest risk being PAD. In addition, smoking has been shown to directly target the epigenome, altering DNA methylation profiles, specifically 187 CpG sites independently validated in a separate cohort . In fact, some mortality predictive DNA methylation clocks, such as GrimAge (discussed below), directly incorporate smoking-related changes through an estimate of pack-years of smoking . \n\nSimilar to smoking, air pollution is a major contributing factor that accelerates the decline of cardiopulmonary health. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence indicates that ambient particulate matter may directly impact the cardiovascular system, although exact biological mechanisms are unknown . In part, the deleterious effects of particulate pollutants may be mediated by oxidative stress and systemic inflammation . Therefore, long-term studies focused on elucidating the molecular pathways involved will be critical for designing mitigative approaches. \n\nGiven that environmental factors can impact multiple aspects of cardiovascular health and modulate lifespan, we discuss below some of the key molecular mechanisms that might be involved in this process. The epigenome is the interface between the environment and phenotype and, consequently, plays an important role in regulating health and disease. \n\n\n### DNA modifications in cardiac pathology \n  \nMethylation of cytosine (5-methylcytosine or 5mC) is the best-studied and most abundant modification on DNA. The 5mC status of groups of CpGs is associated with disease onset and mortality and therefore serves as the basis for several pan-tissue clocks that have been designed to act as \u201cbiological age\u201d estimators. For example, GrimAge  and PhenoAge , two epigenetic clocks trained on chronological age and blood-based biomarkers, are associated with time to the incidence of CVD events . Although a clear mechanistic basis for these clocks is still obscure, the primary genomic regions affected seem to be polycomb targets and those near developmental genes . In concordance, a DNA methylome profiling in purified cardiomyocytes of mice undergoing heart failure showed methylation patterns that resembled those in neonates . Another independent epigenome-wide association study examining relationships between DNA methylation and incident CVD discovered two CpG modules in human cohorts: one associated with developmental genes and the other with immune functions . In keeping with the developmental gene activation theme in diseased hearts, the landscape of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC, an oxidative product of 5mC) in cardiomyocytes derived from developing and hypertrophic hearts resemble, in part, a neonate-like signature. It was shown that 5hmC, which is positively correlated with gene transcription, was reduced over mitochondrial genes and increased over enhancers and gene bodies of fetal genes such as   Myh7  , thereby reactivating them . \n\nInvestigation of DNA methylation in healthy and atherosclerotic lesions from donor-matched aorta samples interestingly revealed focal hypermethylation in the diseased tissue over repeat and non-repeat regions of the genome and in both a CpG and non-CpG context . Furthermore, the differentially methylated regions were associated with endothelial and smooth muscle function. A related study in swine, investigating differential methylation in ECs from an athero-susceptible location (inner curvature of the aortic arch) and an athero-protected region (descending thoracic aorta), also identified many hypermethylated sites that were linked to genes related to transcriptional regulation, pattern-specification HOX loci, oxidative stress, and ER stress adaptive pathway . Furthermore, 5\u2019UTR hypermethylation exhibited an inverse relationship with gene expression at the HOX loci primarily. These observations contrast with DNA methylation changes in aging  or cancer , where global hypomethylation over megabase-sized blocks of the genome is the primary feature despite aging being a risk factor for atherosclerosis. \n\nThe derepression of repeat elements with retrotransposon activation is a known molecular event in senescence and aging. Evidence in senescent cells and mouse tissues indicates that these non-coding transcripts, generated from repeat elements, in turn, are reverse transcribed and activate an interferon response contributing to a systemic proinflammatory status in aging . The overall coverage of 5hmC over repeat elements was shown to decrease during cardiac development but increase in the hypertrophied heart, particularly at long interspersed nuclear elements. This was accompanied by reduced CG methylation and other repressive histone modifications (discussed below), suggesting a consequential activation of these regions in disease . \n\nMost genome-wide methylation studies have been done using bead-based arrays, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing post-bisulfite treatment of DNA. However, these methods fail to distinguish between 5mC or 5hmC and thereby may complicate mechanistic inferences on gene regulation. The recent development of the oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq) method allows for the simultaneous measurement of 5mC and 5hmC at single-nucleotide resolution . We propose that investigation of these distinct DNA modifications in cardiac aging and disease is an understudied but important future research direction. \n\n\n### Altered balance of activating and repressive histone modifications \n  \nHistone post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent another epigenetic mechanism to control gene expression. A core octamer comprising two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones wraps 147 bp of DNA to form the basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. Linker histone H1 binds to linker DNA at the entry and exit sites of DNA on nucleosomes to form the next level of recurring chromatin structural unit, the chromatosome . Core and linker histones are modified by diverse PTMs such as acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation,   etc  . primarily on the unstructured tail regions (although there are many core modifications) and regulate activation or repression of gene expression via opening and closing of chromatin structure in a heritable fashion .   provides an overview of known functions of specific histone modifications from the literature. Active or open chromatin is referred to as euchromatin, and inactive, closed chromatin is called heterochromatin. An existing notion in senescence studies points towards the progressive euchromatinization of the genome with concomitant loss of repressive modifications. \n\nA genome-wide investigation of 7 histone PTMs, lysine 9 acetylation on histone H3 (H3K9ac), H3K27ac, H3K79me2, H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 (\u201cme\u201d indicating methylation) in cardiomyocytes isolated from normal and pressure-overloaded hearts revealed a subset of hypertrophy-associated genes that follow the conventional histone code, i.e., a mutually exclusive enrichment of activating (H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K79me2, and H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3) modifications. Additionally, this study identified a network of ~9000 putative active enhancers in the hypertrophic heart that might correlate to disease pathology, suggesting that histone PTMs regulate the gene network involved in this process . \n\nA cross-tissue analysis of chromatin marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) revealed a clear separation in the RNA and chromatin profiles of young, middle-aged, and old hearts. Importantly, these age-related chromatin features included H3K4me3 and H3K27ac intensity and H3K4me3 breadth, which was previously shown to be linked to transcriptional consistency and high expression output required for maintenance of cell identity. Both dynamic features (such as enhancer score and H3K4me3 breadth) and static features (such as H3K4me3 promoter intensity and H3K4me3 domain breadth in young tissue) were key predictors of age . \n\nStudies focusing on the repressive H3K9 methylation, specifically H3K9me2, revealed that it promotes the reexpression of fetal genes during pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Downregulation of the H3K9 dimethyltransferases EHMT1/2 by miR-217 leads to loss of H3K9me2 over the promoters of fetal heart genes such as atrial natriuretic peptide (  Nppa  ), brain natriuretic peptide (  Nppb  ), and   Myh7   in cardiomyocytes . Knockout or overexpression of the H3K9 trimethyl demethylase JMJD2A (or KDM4A) had no overt cardiac phenotype but exhibited an altered response to stress. For example, overexpression of JMJD2A resulted in exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy while its inactivation was protective after aortic constriction . These results suggest that histone H3K9 repressive modifications play a critical role in suppressing a cardiac stress response that may also be occurring during aging, although it remains to be explicitly tested. \n\nHistone acetylation is a very dynamic histone PTM and is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Loss of HDAC1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 results in exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and, in some cases, neonatal lethality or a shortened lifespan . Sirtuins (SIRT1\u20137) are a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent class III HDACs that have established protective roles in lifespan regulation in multiple species. However, both SIRT1 and NAD+ levels decline during aging . Furthermore, loss of SIRT1 interferes with angiogenesis and neovascularization after ischemia due to aberrant acetylation of FOXO1, potentiating its anti-angiogenic function . Conversely, overexpression of SIRT1 has many beneficial effects on endothelial cell function, including increased migration , decreased endothelial progenitor cell senescence , and reduced vascular oxidative stress and inflammation via inhibition of NF\u03baB and PARP . While SIRT1 also acts on histones, this aspect of regulation remains unexplored. \n\nAvailable studies taken together confirm that histone modifications contribute to CVD, with the direction of changes similar to that observed during senescence. There is a pronounced shift in the balance characterized by reduced repressive marks, especially over repeat elements and increased active modifications. However, due to the paucity of direct work in aged tissue and the lack of integrative analysis, the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. \n\n\n### A core TF network in aging \n  \nA multi-omic (DNA methylome, transcriptome, and epigenome) profiling and integrative analyses of the aging murine heart, liver, and quadriceps muscle identified some common and unique aging footprints across tissues. As a note, this study primarily performed a gene-centric analysis, and therefore changes over features such as enhancers or repeat regions were not analyzed. In the heart, the DNA methylome was the primary epigenetic signature that changed around transcription start sites (TSSs) with approximately an equal number of hypo- and hyper-methylated CpGs. Although more subtle, H3K27ac enrichment increased in the ~5 Kb region around the TSSs, while the H3K27me3 signal decreased. A TF motif enrichment analysis around promoters of genes up- or down-regulated in the heart during aging revealed that TF motifs enriched in genes that increase expression are also enriched in genes that have an increase in H3K27ac and a decrease in H3K27me3. Interestingly, a few TFs common to all three tissues were enriched in upregulated genes and genes with increases in H3K27ac and decreases in H3K27me3 in the heart. These TFs belong to the zinc finger of the cerebellum (Zic) family of factors. Conversely, HMGA1 binds to genes that are downregulated with age. Importantly, the expression of these TFs in humans is altered during aging, and epidemiological studies suggest a link between the altered expression of some of these TFs and the mother\u2019s age . These results suggest that a common set of epigenetic \u201cmaster\u201d regulators may be responsible for driving some of the key transcriptomic changes in aging. \n\n\n### Increased transcriptional noise in the aging heart \n  \nSingle-cell studies have emphasized the presence of heterogeneity and variability within tumors, complex tissues, and surprisingly even overtly pure cell populations. For example, an early study with purified cardiomyocytes isolated from fresh young and old mice hearts revealed increased gene expression variability in old cells . The authors of the study attributed this increased variability to the stochastic nature of the aging process contributed by DNA damage and accumulating somatic mutations. Indeed, mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with hydrogen peroxide showed a similar increase in expression variability. A more recent comprehensive single-cell atlas (Tabula Muris Senis ) of multiple mouse tissues, including heart and aorta, is available but begs for a deeper dive into the dataset to enable the discovery of age-related changes specific to the cardiovascular system. \n\n\n### Non-coding RNA in cardiovascular aging \n  \nThe vast majority of the genome is not translated into proteins but rather serves either as cis-regulatory elements or mediates post-transcriptional gene regulation . These non-coding areas of the genome encode small non-coding RNAs (< 200 nucleotides) or long non-coding RNAs (> 200 nucleotides). Small non-coding RNAs mainly comprise micro-RNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs),   etc  . Long non-coding RNAs can be either linear (lncRNAs) or circular (circRNAs). Non-coding RNAs have long been implicated in senescence and aging, with several studies conducted in the context of cardiovascular aging . \n\nmiRNAs and circRNAs present reliable biomarkers of aging due to their stability in circulation and conservation across species. miR-21 is a particularly well-characterized miRNA targeting SPRY1, a potent inhibitor of the ERK-MAPK pathway. miR-21 increases in cardiofibroblasts of the failing heart, augmenting ERK-MAP\u2009kinase activity impacting interstitial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy . In a study profiling miRNAs in the heart of neonatal, 1 month, 6 months and 19 months old mice, miR-22, which targets osteoglycin, was found to be robustly upregulated. miR-22 overexpression induced senescence and promoted the migration of cardiac fibroblasts . miR-34a is induced in aging cardiomyocytes where it targets PNUTS, a cardioprotective protein that otherwise reduces age-associated cardiomyocyte cell death . Interestingly, miR-34a, through the targeting of a different protein, SIRT1 (discussed above), induces endothelial and VSMC senescence and proinflammatory SASP expression . SIRT1 is also targeted by miR-217 in ECs, where it induces premature senescence and leads to an impairment in angiogenesis via modulation of FOXO1 and nitric oxide synthase acetylation . Transcriptomic analysis of aortic tissue in old mice revealed miR-29 upregulation and the concomitant downregulation of many ECM components that in turn sensitizes the aorta to aneurysm formation . In contrast, a number of other miRNAs (miR-18, miR-19, miR-17\u20133p, miR-92, reviewed in ) are reduced in expression during aging, specifically elevating their targets to affect cardiovascular aging and disease. \n\nCircRNAs impact transcription by acting as sponges of miRNA and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or serving as scaffolds for assembly of larger complexes . Many circRNAs are altered in expression upon hypoxic injury or myocardial infarction (reviewed extensively in ); a few relevant to aging are discussed here. circFoxo3 is generated from the   Foxo3   transcript and was shown to be overexpressed in the aged hearts of mice and humans and correlated to senescence markers. CircFoxo3 is localized to the cytoplasm where it retains several anti-senescence proteins such as ID1, E2F1, FAK, and HIF1\u03b1, thus siphoning their activity away from the nucleus . In addition, a circRNA produced from the senescence/aging relevant   Cdkn2b   locus called Antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (circANRIL) correlates with the expression of its linear RNA and confers atheroprotection. circANRIL binds to PES1, a 60S-preribosomal assembly factor, impairs ribosome biogenesis and thereby induces nucleolar stress and apoptosis in atherogenic VSMCs and macrophages . Unlike miRNAs that are well studied in aged hearts and vasculature, key age-related circRNAs remain to be profiled in detail. \n\nlncRNAs, unlike miRNAs, are not well conserved across species, and therefore their targets and functions should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, numerous studies have evaluated the role of lncRNAs in cardiovascular aging and disease (reviewed in ). lncRNAs are highly versatile, serving as expression signals to trigger a response, competitive endogenous RNAs, guides to direct factors to specific genomic locations, scaffolds for RBPs, or mediators of chromatin looping . For example,   Mhrt  , an antisense lncRNA produced from the region between   Myh6   and   Myh7  , interferes with the switch to fetal   Myh7   expression in hypertrophic hearts.   Mhrt   antagonizes BRG1 function by interacting with its helicase domain and inhibiting chromatin targeting (see next section) .   Chaer  , another lncRNA mediating cardiac hypertrophy, interacts with PRC2 subunits and thereby inhibits the repression of cardiac hypertrophy-related genes .   Meg3   expression is upregulated in senescent HUVEC (endothelial) cells and in the aging cardiovascular system, where it also targets PRC2 components to assert a pro-aging function in aging vasculature . An RNA-seq study in porcine cardiac muscle revealed 4 lncRNAs that were consistently expressed during aging. Ontology analysis of the target genes of these lncRNAs was significantly enriched for negative regulation of myotube differentiation and muscle contraction, suggesting that the lncRNAs likely interfere with the normal muscle physiology . \n\nThere are numerous other examples of non-coding RNA functions in cardiovascular aging that are beyond the scope of this review. However, it is interesting to note that many of them target epigenetic enzymes or TFs and therefore may directly and pervasively impact the epigenome. \n\n\n### ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in the diseased heart \n  \nATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are large multi-subunit molecular machines that utilize ATP to reposition or evict nucleosomes or exchange histones to alter chromatin structure. The BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes are comprised of either brahma or brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) catalytic subunits along with several other accessory proteins. BAF complexes are critical for heart development and disease pathogenesis. For example, BRG1 plays opposing roles at the   Myh6   and   Myh7   loci: in embryos, it interacts with HDACs and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to repress the adult-specific   Myh6   while activating fetal   Myh7   . Brg1   expression is lost in cardiomyocytes but reactivated in hypertrophic hearts. It sequentially recruits G9a and then DNMT3 to deposit H3K9me2 and 5mC at the   Myh6   promoter impairing cardiac contraction . Thus, a complex interplay of repressors and co-repressors recruited by BRG1 in injured hearts activates fetal   Myh7   while interfering with adult   Myh6   expression. Cardiac regeneration (as may be promoted by injury) requires BRG1 not only to suppress   Myh6   but also to increase the expression of pro-proliferative   Bmp10   and   Cdkn1c   genes. Although not directly tested in aging hearts, reactivation of   Brg1   is a plausible mechanism to promote repair. Finally, mutations in genes encoding BAF complex subunits have been associated with various cancers and congenital heart diseases . \n\n\n### Laminopathy and loss of heterochromatin lead to premature aging \n  \nHutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder attributed to a mutation in the lamin A (  LMNA  ) gene that results in the production and incorporation of a truncated version of lamin A called progerin in the nuclear membrane. This misincorporation grossly disrupts the nuclear lamina and lamina-associated heterochromatin and pro-senescence/pro-aging gene expression changes. Surprisingly, HGPS patients usually die in their teens from atherosclerosis and CVD complications suggesting strong links between chromatin dysregulation and CVD events in these patients. Interestingly, vascular progerin production and its progressive increase with age have also been noted in normal individuals, and there are many common histological features in the vasculature of HGPS and geriatric subjects . Additionally, fibroblasts isolated from HGPS patients undergo premature senescence, and in iPSC models of HGPS, many epigenetic changes noted mimic those found in   in vitro   models of cellular senescence. For example, there is a reduction in repressive histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, loss of EZH2, and derepression of LINE elements . This evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations, particularly those found in senescent cells, may drive some of the key CVD pathologies in HGPS. Indeed, selective clearance of naturally occurring p16 positive senescent cells in the heart and senescent foam macrophages at atherosclerotic lesions by senolytics can ameliorate disease symptoms . \n\n summarizes the key concepts of epigenetic regulation impacting CVD: DNA modifications [ ], histone modifications [ ], TF binding [ ], altered gene expression [ ], non-coding RNAs [ ], chromatin remodeling [ ] and lamina disorganization [ ] as derived from models of heart failure, and limitedly, aged tissues. \n\n\n\n## FUTURE PERSPECTIVES AND PROVOCATIVE THERAPIES FOR AGE-RELATED CVD \n  \nWith the advent of better health monitoring, chemotherapies, vaccines, and rehabilitation programs, human life expectancy has increased and will continue to increase in the next few decades. This means that the number of people > 65 years of age will comprise 20% or more of the population by the next decade. Unfortunately, CVD will remain one of the top causes of death among older individuals, surpassing neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, suggesting that the cardiovascular system is especially prone to the chronic deleterious changes that come with age. Until recently, age was thought to be a largely unmodifiable feature of life, but the innovations of the longevity biotechnology field are on a trajectory to change this outcome. Thus, now is the time to identify key mechanisms contributing to heart disease in the elderly to design and rapid testing of breakthrough therapeutics. \n\nSeveral notable interventions which directly or indirectly remodel the epigenome hold promise in ameliorating CVD. Preclinical studies in mouse models have already shown the efficacy of senolytics in countering the deleterious effects of cardiac dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, and calcification . Senostatics that reduce the SASP without eliminating senescent cells, which carry the risk of fibrosis, might also show benefits but have not been directly tested. Potential SASP modulators include glucocorticoids , rapamycin , metformin  and CR/CR mimetics . Although the exact mechanisms underlying age reversal are lacking, these molecules have a profound effect on the epigenome (reviewed in ). Some direct effects of epigenome remodeling are exemplified by enzymes such as MLL1  and BRD4 , which are critical regulators of   SASP   genes. Additional synthetic therapeutics that could potentially modulate senescence or SASP include locked nucleic acids, anti-miRs, and other antisense oligonucleotides that block non-coding RNA activity and/or target them for degradation . Overall, given the predominance of senescent cell function in CVD, targeting them is a viable option to treat age-related cardiac dysfunction. \n\nAnother targetable cell type in CVD is the quiescent cardiomyocyte and fibroblast populations that comprise most adult heart tissue. Unlike senescent cells, quiescent cells are responsive to growth factors and apoptotic signals, making them more pliable for modulation. While neonatal cardiomyocytes are capable of proliferation and regeneration, this function declines rapidly in adults . The cardiac stem cell theory was recently annulled following extensive fate-mapping data that clearly showed that non-myocytes could not produce new cardiomyocytes in the adult during homeostasis or following infarction . Thus, an endogenous stem cell-centric therapy in CVD is contentious. However, the exogenous supply of cardiac progenitors produced from induced pluripotent stem cells could be explored but need careful testing. Another avenue to improve regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes is by inducing controlled proliferation, for example, by cyclical expression of Yamanaka factors. In a premature aging model carrying a   Lmna   mutation, cyclic induction of these pluripotency factors partially rescued the degeneration of VSMCs in the aortic arch compared to untreated mice, as indicated by an increase in the nuclei number. At the functional level, electrocardiographic analysis showed that there was also a partial rescue of bradycardia in the treated mice compared to controls. Yamanaka factors induce reprogramming by changing the histone modification landscape, specifically restoring H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 to youthful levels . \n\nPathological, activated cardiac fibroblasts (as opposed to quiescent fibroblasts) are induced following cardiac injury and can cause excessive fibrosis. These activated fibroblasts have been shown to have a unique gene expression signature, prominently the upregulation of fibroblast activation protein, which was targeted to eliminate them by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy  selectively. We propose that a similar survey of the transcriptome and epigenome can discover neoantigens on aged tissues, which can then be exploited for immunotherapy in CVD. \n\nOf note, most of the studies discussed in this review use mouse models of heart failure or cardiac disease to interrogate epigenetic features. However, the experimental rodent is usually an adult (2\u20134 months old) with a very different epigenomic landscape than older animals, who present the most risk for disease. These models thus may accurately capture acute pathological changes while completely missing the contribution to disease of any long-term chronic effects such as systemic inflammation or global epigenetic changes. Conversely, studies that focused on interventions that extend lifespan rarely measured whether the cardiovascular function was improved . Collectively, the field must embrace naturally aged mice models and impose the inclusion of age as a biological variable to gain deeper insight into the etiology of age-related cardiac dysfunction and disease. \n\n\n## CONCLUDING REMARKS \n  \nIn the studies that have considered both the perspective of aging and cardiovascular health, we have accumulated important insights into the epigenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular aging that we describe in this review. Genomic regions that are targeted during aging include repeat elements and lamina-bound heterochromatin, developmental gene promoters, polycomb targets, and stress response genes. These regions also show prominent changes in DNA modifications. The histone code itself is unaltered, but specific master TFs co-opt epigenetic enzymes and chromatin architectural proteins to promote a disease phenotype. Concordant with changes in DNA and histone modifications, the coding, and non-coding transcriptome is also significantly altered, impacting cardiac function and vascular physiology. Further studies will illuminate more precise roles of epigenetic factors that can ultimately be exploited to design novel therapeutics. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8594871, "text_md5": "517111e72e62093e8eb7c919fc39888b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 54], "journal": [55, 73], "publication_year": [75, 79], "title": [90, 150], "keywords": [164, 218], "abstract": [231, 1952], "body": [1961, 50430]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34790973, "doi": "10.20517/jca.2021.16", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8594871", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8594871"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8594871\">8594871</a>", "list_title": "PMC8594871  Epigenetic dysregulation in cardiovascular aging and disease"}

However, little is known how human erythropoiesis is regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). By using ChIRP-seq, we report here that the lncRNA steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) occupies chromatin, and co-localizes with CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 genome-wide in human erythroblast cell line K562. CTCF binding sites that are also occupied by SRA are enriched for either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3. Transcriptome-wide analyses reveal that SRA facilitates expression of erythroid-associated genes, while repressing leukocyte-associated genes in both K562 and CD36-positive primary human proerythroblasts derived from HSCs. We find that SRA-regulated genes are enriched by both CTCF and SRA bindings. Further, silencing of SRA decreases expression of the erythroid-specific markers TFRC and GYPA, and down-regulates expression of globin genes in both K562 and human proerythroblast cells. Taken together, our findings establish that the lncRNA SRA occupies chromatin, and promotes transcription of erythroid genes, therefore facilitating human erythroid transcriptional program. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdult erythropoiesis is a cellular physiological process in the bone marrow which produces red blood cells (RBCs) to maintain homeostasis of the body. Through the proerythroblast stage producing transit amplifying cells, billions of RBCs are spatiotemporally generated by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Intrinsic, extrinsic, and environmental factors play crucial roles in this process to precisely control a sufficient quantity of the oxygen-carrying cells that are required for oxygen transport. Among key intrinsic factors regulating erythropoiesis are chromatin binding proteins including transcriptional and epigenetic machineries. At the onset of erythropoiesis, a sequential activation of DNA-binding transcription factors such as GATA1, TAL1, and KLF1 delineates the gradual development of erythroid cells ( ). The histone modifying complexes trithorax group (TrxG) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which methylate H3K4, and H3K27, respectively, are also critical for normal erythropoiesis ( ;  ;  ). Yet, little is known about how distinct transcription and epigenetic factors are recruited or tethered to chromatin. Thus characterization of mechanisms involved in genetic-epigenetic crosstalk is essential to understand erythropoiesis. \n\nA significant role has been discovered for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in transcriptional control ( ). The lncRNA steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) was identified as a non-coding transcript which promotes transcriptional activation of the estrogen receptors ( ,  ). A role of SRA has been reported in regulation of imprinted gene expression via the chromatin architectural transcription factor CTCF and SRA-associated RNA helicase DDX5 ( ). Moreover, we have also shown that SRA physically and directly interacts with NANOG, CTCF, TrxG, and PRC2, and that SRA is important for maintenance of pluripotency and transition into induced pluripotent stem cells ( ). Whether SRA participates in regulation of erythropoiesis has been elusive. In the present study, we report a novel function of the lncRNA SRA in regulation of global gene expression through direct chromatin binding in human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and in primary human proerythroblasts derived from HSCs. We demonstrate that SRA, together with CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3, occupies various genomic regions in K562. Further, SRA facilitates transcriptome-wide expression of erythroid program and expression of erythroid markers in K562 and in primary human proerythroblasts. Hence, a possible function of the lncRNA SRA is to promote transcription of erythroid-associated genes. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Cell Culture \n  \nThe cell line K562 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with GlutaMAX  (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO  and passaged every 3 days. CD36-positive human proerythroblasts were derived from bone marrow CD34-positive cells, which were purchased from Stem Cell Technologies (70002.1) and cultured in erythroid differentiation condition as previous described ( ). Briefly, the CD34-positive cells at 10  cells/ml were grown in the serum-free erythroid expansion medium containing Alpha minimum essential medium (AMEM; Mediatech) and 20% BIT9500 (Stem Cell Technologies) to achieve bovine serum albumin, recombinant human insulin and iron-saturated human transferrin at 10 mg/ml, 10 \u03bcg/ml, and 200 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In addition, 900 ng/ml ferrous sulfate (Sigma), 90 ng/ml ferric nitrate (Sigma), 1 \u03bcM hydrocortisone (Sigma), 100 ng/ml of recombinant human stem cell factor (SCF; Stem Cell Technologies), 5 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3; R&D Systems), and 3 IU/ml of recombinant human EPO were also included. Fresh medium was added into the culture to maintain cells at 2 \u00d7 10  cells/ml. The cells were cultured for 7 days to obtain CD36-positive cells. \n\n\n### RNA Silencing \n  \nshRNA templates including luciferase shRNA scramble control (shLuc) and shRNA sequences targeting   SRA   transcript (shSRA-1: 5\u2032 CCACAAGTTTCCCAGTCGAGT 3\u2032, shSRA-2: 5\u2032 TGCAGCCACAGCTGAGAAGAA 3\u2032, and shSRA-3: 5\u2032 ACTGAGGTCAGTCAGTGGAT 3\u2032) were individually cloned into the lentiviral vector pGreenPuro (System Biosciences) at   BamH  1/  Eco  RI restriction sites according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The plasmids were transformed into   Escherichia coli   strain   stbl3   (Invitrogen) via heat shock method and propagated in LB broth supplemented with carbenicillin. All plasmids were purified by using PureLink  HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Invitrogen). \n\nLentiviral particles were produced by co-transfecting LentiX-293T cells (Clontech) with a packaging vector (psPAX2), an envelope vector (pLP/VSVG), and an shRNA plasmid (shLuc, shSRA-1, shSRA-2, or shSRA-3) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previous described ( ). Twenty four hour after the transfection, the medium was changed to the target cell medium. Then the medium containing lentiviral particles were collected and filtered through 0.22 \u03bcM filter at 48 h post-transfection. Transduction was performed by adding the medium containing lentiviral particles with 10 \u03bcg/ml polybrene into either K562 or CD36-positive proerythroblasts. The cells were then centrifuged at 1,000   g   at room temperature for 2 h and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO  overnight before changing medium. Expression of GFP was examined under fluorescent microscope to validate transduction efficiency at 48 h post-transduction. The GFP-positive cells were then sorted by FACS at 96 h post-transduction and maintained in the presence of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml puromycin for further analysis. \n\n\n### RNA-Sequencing Analysis \n  \nTotal RNA was extracted from the sorted cells and purified using QIAzol Lysis Reagent and miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples for sequencing were prepared according to Smart-seq2 method ( ) with some modifications as previously described ( ). RNA-seq libraries were prepared with an End-It DNA End-repair Kit (Epicenter) and a Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit (Illumina), and the libraries submitted for single-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2500 ( ). Sequencing data was annotated to the human reference genome GRch38 by Tophat2 ( ) with Bowtie2 ( ), and the raw read counts and FPKMs were acquired by HTseq ( ) and Cufflinks ( ), respectively. TPMs were then calculated according to their FPKMs. Using raw read count from HTseq as input, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by DEseq package ( ) with   p  -value < 0.01 and with TPM > 2. Three different SRA silencing samples targeted for individual shRNA target sites were used as three biological replicates. Accession number of sequencing data associated with RNA-seq is  . Volcano plots and heatmaps were generated by R studio ( ) using EnhancedVolcano and gplots package, respectively ( ). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG pathways were determined by DIVID software ( ,  ) using the DEGs from DEseq. Network analysis of coding genes from DEGs was performed using STRING or Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins ( ). \n\n\n### Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis \n  \nRNA was extracted and purified using QIAzol Lysis Reagent and miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried on with 1 \u03bcg RNA using iScript  Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Biorad). qRT-PCR was performed by using KAPA SYBR  FAST qPCR Master Mix (2X) Kit (Kapa Biosystems) with LightCycler  96 system (Roche).   ACTB   gene was used for normalization of gene expression and the \u0394\u0394Ct method was used for analysis of relative expression level. Primer sequences are available upon requested. \n\n\n### Flow Cytometry Analysis \n  \nOne million cells and five million cells were used for surface marker analysis and cell sorting, respectively. Cells were collected and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl PBS with 2% FBS. Fluorescent conjugated antibodies were added into the cell suspension and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in dark. The stained cells were washed once and resuspended in the PBS/FBS buffer before analysis or sorting with FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software. Unstained wild-type cells and the Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls were used as negative control for gating population. The antibodies using in the experiment include APC-conjugated anti-human CD235a (eBioscience, 17-9987-41), PE-conjugated anti-human CD34 (eBioscience, 12-0349-41), and PerCP-eFluor710-conjugated anti-human CD36 (eBioscience, 46-0369-41). \n\n\n### Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) \n  \nChromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) analysis was performed as previously described with minor modifications ( ,  ;  ). The cell line K562 harvested at 3 \u00d7 10  cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature with a rotator and then stopped by adding glycine solution at 125 mM of its final concentration. Crosslinked cells were washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml swelling buffer. Samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min with a rotator. Cell pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended with 350 \u03bcL of ChIRP lysis buffer. Cell sonication was performed using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) at maximum power, 30 s ON and 30 s OFF for 7.5 min of 6 cycles to obtain chromatin fragments ranging from 100\u20131000 bp. Chromatin fragments was then collected by centrifugation. Two hundred micrograms of sheared chromatin samples were pre-cleared using 100 \u03bcL of Ultralink-streptavidin beads (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature with a rotator, and supernatant was collected. The pre-cleared chromatin was used per hybridization reaction with 10 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM pooled 3\u2032 Biotin TEG oligonucleotide probes (Integrated DNA Technologies) against SRA transcript ( ). LacZ probes were employed as negative control ( ). The sample and the probes were hybridized at 37\u00b0C for 4 h with a rotator. Once the hybridization was completed, 100 \u03bcL of C-1 magnetic beads (Invitrogen) was mixed with the sample to pull down the biotinylated probes. DNA was eluted in the presence of 12.5 mM D-Biotin (Invitrogen). DNA was ethanol precipitated and subjected to library preparation, which was performed using MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit (Diagenode) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Three biological triplicates were used for ChIRP-seq. Briefly, 5\u201310 ng of DNA starting material, which was quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen), was used for each biological sample. The DNA was end-repaired, 3\u2032 adenylated, and ligated with adapters. Then the ligated DNA was size-selected to obtain DNA fragments at 250\u2013300 bp by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA was amplified to enrich the library. The final PCR product was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and was submitted for high-throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500. The sequencing was performed with the run type of single-end, 50 bp read. Data were aligned against the human genome version human_hg19, and were exported into BAM file format. Accession number of sequencing data associated with ChIRP-seq is  . \n\nThe associated-binding regions of SRA identified from ChIRP-seq and ChIP-seq data for CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 in K562 were identified by ChIPpeakAnno package ( ;  ) with max gap equals to 500 bp in R studio. The ChIP-seq data were taken from the ENCODE project of K562 cells. The region-associated genes were identified by GREAT ( ) using two nearest genes\u2019 TSS within 50 kb up- and down-stream of the regulatory binding sites including curated regulatory domains. The Fisher\u2019s Exact test to measure peak enrichment was taken from the Fisher\u2019s exact function from the R package for statistical computing ( ). \n\n\n### RNA Pull Down \n  \nRNA pull down experiments were performed as previously described ( ;  ). The plasmid pLITMUS28i (New England Biolabs) containing full length SRA was linearized by   Stu  I or   Bgl  I to generate antisense or sense SRA transcripts, respectively ( ). Biotinylated SRA and a maltose-binding protein transcript were   in vitro   transcribed using HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs) in the presence of biotin-14-CTP (Invitrogen). Transcribed RNA products were DNase-treated (Roche), and purified by ethanol precipitation. 3 \u03bcg of sense SRA, antisense SRA, and MBP RNA was individually prepared in RNA structure buffer (Tris\u2013Cl pH 7.5, 0.1 M KCl, and 10 mM MgCl ) and incubated at 78\u00b0C for 3 min. The RNA was then gradually cooled down to 37\u00b0C. Five hundred micrograms of K562 nuclear extract, which was prepared by Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit (Pierce), was mixed with the RNA in immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, PMSF, and 80 U RNase inhibitor) in a total volume of 500 \u03bcL. The reaction was incubated for 4 h at 4\u00b0C with rotation. The RNA-beads complex isolated by MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads was further incubated overnight. Beads were washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer and boiled with SDS loading buffer for western blot analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nFor qPCR and FACS, data was analyzed using two-tailed unpaired Student   t  -test and shown as mean with standard deviation of three independent replicates. The significance values were determined at 95%, with   p   \u2264 0.05. Differential expressed genes were determined by DEseq package based on the negative binomial distribution with significant at   p   < 0.01. Fisher Exact test was used to determine significant enriched GO terms with   p   < 0.05 using DAVID software. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### SRA Co-localizes With CTCF, H3K4me3, or H3K27me3 Genome-Wide \n  \nThe lncRNA SRA has been shown to mediate transcriptional regulation in several cellular contexts ( ). We have previously reported that SRA possesses genome-wide binding regions of human pluripotent stem cells ( ). Yet, little is known for the role of SRA in transcriptional regulation in erythropoiesis. To identify SRA-binding sites of human erythroblasts, we performed SRA ChIRP-seq ( ;  ) for the human erythroblast cell line K562. Biotin-conjugated deoxyoligonucleotide probes tiling along SRA ( ) were hybridized with the lncRNA using sheared chromatin from K562 cells. Using next generation sequencing, we identified 2,790 SRA-binding sites genome-wide; most of which are located within 50 kb upstream or downstream of transcription start site ( ). Up- or down-stream nearest genes within this 50 kb were queried. Among these 2,790 SRA-bound genomic regions, 1,742 and 1,048 regions representing 62.4 and 37.6% of total SRA binding sites are associated with 2,170 genes and not associated with any nearby genes, respectively. Gene classification analysis reveals that SRA-bound regions are associated with genes involved in cell proliferation, Wnt signaling, NF-\u03baB signaling, regulation of protein phosphorylation, cell differentiation, and metabolisms (  and  ). Seven genes bound by SRA were also identified as oxygen transport including   HBA2  ,   HBB  ,   HBD  ,   HBG1  ,   HBE1  ,   HBM  , and   CYGB  . We validated the occupancy of the lncRNA SRA at alpha and beta globin loci using ChIRP followed by real-time PCR analysis, which reveals an association of the lncRNA along both alpha and beta globin loci ( ). Specifically, at the alpha locus SRA occupies the regulatory element HS40, a site upstream of   HBA2   and a site downstream of the locus ( ). At the beta locus, SRA occupies   HBB  ,   HBG  ,   HBE   as well as the locus control region (LCR;  ). The ChIRP-seq and ChIRP-PCR results therefore indicate the direct association of the lncRNA SRA at chromatin level of human erythroblasts. \n  \nThe lncRNA SRA occupies chromatin genome-wide with CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3. ChIRP-seq analysis of SRA was performed using human erythroblast cells K562. Publicly available ChIP-seq data for CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 were derived from the ENCODE project.   (A)   Categories of enriched gene ontologies of SRA-associated genes (  p  -value < 0.05) and their enrichment scores [\u2212log(  p  -value)] were analyzed using DAVID.   (B)   Examples of genes with the enrichment signal of SRA, LacZ, and the input.   (C)   Genomic regions occupied by SRA and containing CTCF binding site tend to associate with H3K4me3. Left; Genome-wide SRA-binding sites were compared with CTCF and H3K4me3. Right; Percentage of co-occupancy of H3K4me3 at SRA binding sites without or with CTCF occupancy.   (D)   Genomic regions occupied by SRA and containing CTCF binding site tend to associate with H3K27me3. Left; Genome-wide SRA-binding sites were compared with CTCF and H3K27me3. Right; Percentage of co-occupancy of H3K27me3 at SRA binding sites without or with CTCF occupancy. \n  \nWe and others have previously reported that SRA directly forms complexes with the chromatin architectural transcription factor CTCF ( ;  ), the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase TrxG, and the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase PRC2 ( ). RNA pull down in K562 cells reveals that sense SRA, but not antisense SRA or MBP transcripts, can pull down the RNA helicase DDX5, the chromatin architectural protein CTCF, the TrxG component WDR5, and the PRC2 member EZH2 ( ). This result suggests that SRA might interact with TrxG and PRC2 in the cells, supporting our previous finding of a direct physical interaction of SRA/TrxG/PRC2   in vitro   ( ). Using ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, we show here that SRA and CTCF co-occupy 540 sites representing 19.3% of SRA binding sites ( ). Comparing SRA with profiles of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in K562, we find that 465 and 789 sites representing 16.7 and 28.3% of total SRA binding sites possess, respectively, either the H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 modification ( ). When comparing SRA, CTCF and the histone modifications, 245 and 192 sites representing about 8.8% and 6.9% of SRA binding regions are also co-occupied by CTCF plus H3K4me3 and CTCF plus H3K27me3, respectively. \n\nSince SRA has been proposed to deliver TrxG or PRC2 to SRA-associated transcription factors including CTCF ( ), we then asked whether sites of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 modifications might be enriched at genomic regions occupied by both CTCF and SRA relative to those occupied by CTCF alone. We observe a higher proportion (45.4% versus 20.8%) of CTCF binding sites carrying the H3K4me3 modification at genomic regions occupied by both CTCF and SRA compared with those occupied by CTCF but lacking SRA ( ). Similarly, the presence of SRA at CTCF binding sites correlates with a higher proportion of H3K27me3 modification (35.6% versus 11.5%) ( ). Thus the genome-wide occupancy of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 at SRA-associated CTCF binding sites suggest a possible role for the lncRNA SRA in transcriptional control of human erythroblast cells. \n\n\n### SRA Regulates Hematopoiesis-Related Genes Transcriptome-Wide in K562 \n  \nTo ascertain whether the lncRNA SRA globally regulates genes of the erythroblasts K562, a lentiviral transduction carrying an shRNA cassette was introduced into the cells. The lncRNA SRA transcript was successfully depleted ( ). RNA-seq analysis of K562 was then performed upon depletion of SRA using an Illumina HiSeq platform. DEGs with at least two fold-change were subsequently identified by using DEseq. Three individual shRNA knockdown samples, which were transduced with target site-specific shRNA targeting   SRA   transcript, were used as biological replicates for the analysis. Silencing of SRA led to differential expression of 675 genes, with 322 and 353 genes were down- and up-regulated by SRA knockdown, respectively (  and  ). Gene ontology analysis of genes positively controlled by SRA shows that erythroblast-associated pathways such as heme biosynthesis (e.g.,   CPOX  ,   PPOX  , and   ALAS2  ), iron homeostasis (e.g.,   TF  ,   TFRC  , and   SLC11A2  ), cell proliferation (e.g.,   TAL1  ,   BMX  , and   ERBB3  ), and erythrocytes (e.g.,   GYPA  ,   AQP1  , and   AHSP  ) are enriched in the gene groups induced by SRA (  and  ). Genes belonging to these pathways are clustered as shown by a functional network analysis ( ). On the other hand, the classification analysis of genes negatively controlled by SRA shows that leukocyte-associated pathways such as immune response (e.g.,   FTH1  ,   IL1RN  , and   LCP2  ), inflammatory response (e.g.,   FOS  ,   JUN  ,   CCL2  , and   AIM2  ), and chemotaxis (e.g.,   CCL2  ,   CCR7  , and   CXCL2  ) are enriched in the gene groups repressed by SRA (  and  ). Genes associated with these pathways are well clustered ( ). \n  \nSRA regulates transcription of hematopoiesis-related genes in the human erythroblast cells K562. The lncRNA SRA controls expression of 675 genes in the human erythroblast cells K562. RNA-seq was performed for cells depleted for SRA using individual shRNA constructs, i.e., shSRA-1, shSRA-2, or shSRA-3, and the control knockdown shLuc. Following silencing of SRA in K562 cells, 322, and 353 genes are down- and up-regulated in SRA knockdown cells, respectively.   (A)   Volcano plot illustrating changes in gene expression upon SRA silencing. The plot represents statistical significance vs expression fold change between the two conditions. Results from three biological replicates using different shRNA targets are shown. Genes with log2 fold change > 1 or <\u22121 and   p  -value < 0.01 are considered to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and are shown in red dots.   (B)   Heat map of DEGs between SRA knockdown samples and the control was analyzed. Pseudocount of TPMs was employed for calculation of fold-change using TPM + 1. The fold-change was calculated from TPM values of knockdown per TPM values of control, and the graph was plotted by representing log2(fold-change) of DEGs. Categories of enriched gene ontologies (GO) of genes up- and down-regulated by SRA in K562 (  p  -value < 0.05) were analyzed using DAVID. Examples of genes within the GO terms are shown on the right. \n  \nWe and others have previously shown that SRA can form complexes with the chromatin architectural protein CTCF, RNA helicases, TrxG, and PRC2, to control transcription of SRA target genes ( ;  ). To further elucidate whether genes differentially expressed by SRA knockdown are occupied by SRA and CTCF at the chromatin level, an association analysis among the DEGs, SRA-bound genes and CTCF-bound genes was performed. There are 221 genes regulated by SRA without CTCF binding compared to 454 genes regulated by SRA with CTCF binding ( ). In addition, we also asked whether SRA-regulated genes might be enriched by both CTCF and SRA binding relative to those with SRA alone. Even though we do not observe genes bound by SRA alone, there is a 14.8% (14.8% versus 0.0%) increase of SRA-regulated genes occupied by both CTCF and SRA compared with those without CTCF binding ( ), indicating a contribution of the transcription factor CTCF in regulation of genes controlled by SRA. To determine to what extent SRA-occupied DEGs also contain H3K4me3 or H3K27me3, we also compared DEGs occupied by SRA in association with H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 ( ). Among genes occupied by SRA, we found that genes up-regulated or down-regulated by SRA tend to associate with H3K4me3 together with H3K27me3 ( ). To a lesser extent, genes up-regulated or down-regulated by SRA also harbor H3K4me3 but not H3K27me3. Collectively, these results suggest the role of SRA in transcriptome-wide regulation of human erythroblast cells. \n  \nGenes differentially expressed by SRA knockdown are occupied by SRA, CTCF and histone marks at the chromatin level. Publicly available ChIP-seq data for CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 were derived from the ENCODE project.   (A)   Genes transcriptionally regulated by SRA and containing SRA binding site tend to associate with CTCF. Numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared with numbers of SRA-associated genes or CTCF-associated genes as shown by the Venn diagram. Percentage of DEGs with both SRA and CTCF occupancy is higher than that without CTCF.   (B)   A comparison of differentially expressed genes occupied by SRA in association with H3K4me3 or H3K27me3.   (C)   Genes down-regulated or up-regulated by SRA containing SRA occupancy were grouped into four categories depending on the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3. \n  \nNext, we confirmed whether SRA silencing affects expression of erythroblast markers of K562. Upon the silencing of SRA, expression of committed erythroid genes   TFRC   and   GYPA   was reduced as determined by real-time PCR ( ). Flow cytometry analysis of the two erythroid markers reveals that depletion of SRA led to a decrease in the antigen expression ( ) and in the number of cells positive for the markers ( ). Further, expression of globin genes including   HBA1/2  ,   HBE  ,   HBG1/2  , and   HBD   is reduced in K562 cells following SRA depletion ( ). Since the beta globin gene is not expressed in this cell line, it was not included in our analysis. These results indicate a supportive role of the lncRNA SRA in erythroid-specific transcriptional regulation of the human erythroblasts K562. \n  \nThe lncRNA SRA maintains expression of erythroid-specific genes in K562. In the human erythroblast cell line, depletion of SRA decreased   TFRC   (A)   and   GYPA   (D)   gene expression.   ATCB   was utilized as an internal control. Error bars represent SD. (  n   = 3; *  p   < 0.05; ***  p   < 0.01).   (B,C,E,F)   Flow cytometry analysis shows that both expression level and the number of cells positive for the two markers are reduced by SRA knockdown. The histograms are shown to compare percentage of positive populations and expression level. Gray: negative control staining; Blue: control knockdown; Red: SRA knockdown of three different constructs; and White: control knockdown shown as a background.   (G)   SRA also facilitates expression of globin genes   HBA1/2  ,   HBE  ,   HBG1/2  , and   HBD   in K562.   ATCB   was utilized as an internal control. Error bars represent SD. (  n   = 3; ***  p   < 0.01). \n  \n\n### SRA Regulates Hematopoiesis-Related Genes Transcriptome-Wide in HSC-Derived Primary Human Proerythroblast Cells \n  \nTo translate whether SRA controls transcriptome-wide expression of primary human proerythroblasts, CD34-positive HSCs were induced to CD36-positive proerythroblast cells. qPCR analysis revealed that expression of the lncRNA SRA is induced upon erythroblast differentiation of HSCs, although only marginally ( ). The CD36-positive proerythroblast cells were then transduced with lentiviruses to silence SRA expression. As shown in  , SRA transcript was successfully knocked down in CD36-positive proerythroblasts. RNA-seq analysis of CD36-positive proerythroblast cells was performed upon depletion of SRA using three different shRNA constructs. Silencing of SRA led to differential expression of 515 genes, with 233 and 282 genes were down- and up-regulated by SRA knockdown, respectively (  and  ). Gene ontology analysis of genes positively controlled by SRA shows that cell division- and erythroblast-associated pathways such as cell cycle (e.g.,   CDK1  ,   CDC6  , and   MCM2  ), telomere maintenance (e.g.,   RFC3, RFC4  , and   RPA2  ), heme biosynthesis (e.g.,   ALAS2, CPOX  , and   UROS  ), and erythrocytes (e.g.,   KLF1  ,   TFRC  ,   GYPA  ,   HBG2  ,   HBD  , and   AHSP  ) are enriched in the gene groups induced by SRA (  and  ). Genes belonging to these pathways are clustered in two nodes as shown by a functional network analysis ( ). On the other hand, the classification analysis of genes negatively controlled by SRA shows that leukocyte-associated pathways such as inflammatory response (e.g.,   CD14  ,   PYCARD  ,   SERPINE1  ,   PF4  ,   IL1B  ,   IL2RA  , and   LYZ  ), immune response (e.g.,   FTH1  ,   CSF2  , and   IL7R  ), and chemokine (e.g.,   CCL1  ,   CCL2  ,   CCL4  ,   CXCL8  , and   CXCR4  ) are enriched in the gene groups repressed by SRA (  and  ). Genes associated with these pathways are also well clustered ( ). By comparing genes down- or up-regulated upon SRA knockdown, we find that 30 and 80 genes are overlapped between K562 and primary erythroblasts, respectively ( ). Examples of gene categories commonly induced by SRA between the two cell types include those involved in heme biosynthesis, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte differentiation such as   TFRC  ,   GYPA  ,   ALAS2  ,   AHSP  , and   EPB42  . Examples of gene categories commonly suppressed by SRA between the two cell types include those involved in immune response, angiogenesis, and lipopolysaccharide response such as   FTH1  ,   CCL2  ,   IL1RN  ,   THBS1  , and   CXCL8  . Nonetheless, the majority of DEGs are cell type-specific, either found exclusively in K562 or in primary erythroblasts. This cell type-specific gene expression might reflect differences of their origins, i.e., K562 as erythroleukemia cells and CD36-positive cells as primary erythroblasts. Specifically, 292 genes induced by SRA exclusively in K562 such as   DNAJB2  ,   GDF2  ,   SLC11A2  ,   TF  , and   LGALS3BP   are functionally grouped as negative regulation of cell growth, cellular iron ion homeostasis, and platelet degranulation. Further, 203 genes suppressed by SRA exclusively in K562 such as   GNG12  ,   JUN  ,   TNFRSF8  ,   DGKG  , and   RAP2B   are functionally grouped as response to lipopolysaccharide and platelet activation. For CD36-positive proerythroblasts, 273 genes induced by SRA exclusively in the cells but not in K562 such as   CENPW  ,   CENPX  ,   MCM2  ,   RPA2  , and   CDC6   can be grouped within cell division and DNA replication. In addition, 202 genes suppressed by SRA exclusively in proerythroblasts such as   GBP5  ,   CCL4  ,   CCL17  ,   CD14  , and   ITGB2   are functionally grouped as inflammatory response and neutrophil chemotaxis. Together, this result indicates the role of SRA in global gene regulation of erythroleukemia and in primary human proerythroblasts. \n  \nSRA regulates transcription of hematopoiesis-related genes in the human CD36-positive erythroid progenitor cells. The lncRNA SRA controls expression of 515 genes in the human CD36-positive erythroid progenitor cells. RNA-seq was performed for cells depleted for SRA using individual shRNA constructs, i.e., shSRA-1, shSRA-2, or shSRA-3, and the control knockdown shLuc. Following silencing of SRA in the CD36-positive cells, 233 and 282 genes are down- and up-regulated in SRA knockdown cells, respectively.   (A)   Volcano plot illustrating changes in gene expression upon SRA silencing. The plot represents statistical significance vs expression fold change between the two conditions. Results from three biological replicates using different shRNA targets are shown. Genes with log2 fold change > 1 or <\u22121 and   p  -value < 0.01 are considered to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and are shown in red dots.   (B)   Heat map of DEGs between SRA knockdown samples and the control was analyzed. Pseudocount of TPMs was employed for calculation of fold-change using TPM + 1. The fold-change was calculated from TPM values of knockdown per TPM values of control, and the graph was plotted by representing log2(fold-change) of DEGs. Categories of enriched gene ontologies of genes up- and down-regulated by SRA in CD36-positive proerythroblasts (  p  -value < 0.05) and their enrichment scores [\u2212log(  p  -value)] were analyzed using DAVID. \n  \nNext, we substantiated whether SRA silencing reduces expression of erythroblast markers of the primary proerythroblast cells. At the early stage of differentiation, we found that SRA depletion led to an increase in CD34-positive population, while CD36-positive population was reduced ( ). Expression of the committed erythroid marker   TFRC   and   GYPA   is reduced in erythroid-induced differentiating HSCs ( ). However, unlike K562, flow cytometry analysis of TFRC in proerythroblasts shows that both antigen expression level and number of cells positive of TFRC are not different between the control and SRA-depleted cells ( ). Nonetheless, depletion of SRA led to a decrease in the antigen expression and in the number of cells positive for GYPA ( ). We also tested whether expression of the globin genes is transcriptionally controlled by SRA. Real-time PCR analysis reveals that silencing of SRA led to a decrease in globin gene expression ( ). Taken together with the RNA-seq data, these results suggest that the lncRNA SRA facilitates transcriptional expression of erythroid-associated genes of primary human proerythroblast cells. \n  \nSRA facilitates expression of erythroid-specific genes of CD36-positive erythroid progenitor cells. During erythroid-induced differentiation, depletion of SRA decreased   TFRC   (A)   and   GYPA   (D)   gene expression.   ATCB   was utilized as an internal control. Error bars represent SD. (  n   = 3; ***  p   < 0.01). However, flow cytometry analysis shows that expression level of the erythroid marker TFRC   (B)   and number of TFRC-positive cells   (C)   are not affected by SRA knockdown, whereas those of GYPA   (E,F)   are reduced by SRA knockdown. The histograms are shown to compare percentage of positive populations and expression level. Gray: negative control staining; Blue: control knockdown; Red: SRA knockdown of three different constructs; and White: control knockdown shown as a background.   (G)   SRA facilitates expression of globin genes   HBA1/2  ,   HBE  ,   HBG1/2  , and   HBD   in CD36-positive erythroid progenitor cells.   ATCB   was utilized as an internal control. Error bars represent SD. (  n   = 3; ***  p   < 0.01). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDelineating molecular mechanisms underlying erythroblast gene regulation is critical for understanding RBC disorders. A vast arrays of molecular and cellular pathways have been discovered to control this process ( ). For example, crosstalk between signal transductions and transcription factors modulates erythropoiesis in both mice and men ( ). Epigenetic regulators such as enzymes that modify DNA and histones also participate in regulation of erythropoiesis at chromatin level ( ). In this work, we find that the lncRNA SRA occupies chromatin genome-wide in the human erythroblast cell line K562 ( ), and controls expression of erythroblast-associated genes transcriptome-wide in both K562 and HSC-derived primary erythroblast cells ( ,  ). Moreover, expression of the erythroid marker GYPA, and the number of GYPA-positive cells are decreased in K562 and primary erythroblasts depleted for SRA ( ,  ) suggesting that the lncRNA SRA facilitates erythroid transcriptional program. However, we observed a reduction in TFRC expression only in K562 but not in the primary erythroblasts depleted for SRA. The relatively high level of TFRC expression of primary erythroblasts is consistent with the maintenance of TFCR expression in erythroblasts   in vitro   ( ;  ). \n\nRecently, more than 9,000 genes encoding lncRNAs have been identified as being transcribed from the human genome ( ). They can participate in transcriptional regulation by acting as scaffold machineries for transcription factors and epigenetic modifying enzymes ( ). Using ChIRP-seq and ChIRP-PCR, we show here that SRA occupies at the alpha and beta globin loci, and facilitates the expression of the globin genes including   HBA1/2  ,   HBG1/2  ,   HBE  , and   HBD   in K562 cells and human proerythroblasts ( ,  ). SRA can form a complex with the chromatin architectural transcription factor CTCF, whose function in transcriptional control of genes at the beta globin locus has long been appreciated ( ;  ). Specifically, CTCF has been shown to facilitate expression of the gamma globin gene ( ). In addition, the DNA binding transcription factor ATF2 which interacts with SRA also induces expression of the gamma globin gene ( ). In contrast to SRA, the lncRNA HMI has been shown to suppress expression of the gamma globin gene ( ). At the alpha globin locus, lncRNA-\u03b1GT controls chicken globin expression ( ). Since reactivation of   HBG   is a promising strategy for sickle cell anemia ( ) and accumulating evidence have suggested the role of lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation of globin genes, it is pivotal to determine which chromatin-associated factor(s) brings SRA and other lncRNAs to their target sites to induce expression of the globin genes. \n\nThe lncRNA SRA has been reported to promote cell fate transition including myogenesis ( ;  ) and adipogenesis ( ) as well as a transition into the pluripotent state ( ). Yet, it has been elusive whether SRA is involved in transcriptional control during erythropoiesis. Estrogen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor, which are SRA-associated nuclear receptors, have been suggested to attenuate erythroid lineage ( ;  ;  ;  ). On the other hand, transcription factors involved in SRA-mediated transcriptional regulation such as CTCF and thyroid hormone receptor have been shown to facilitate generation of erythroid cells ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Apart from being associated with transcription factors, the role of SRA in supporting cell fate transition and plasticity might be in part due to its interaction with epigenetic machineries ( ). We have previously reported that SRA interacts with CTCF, TrxG, and PRC2 ( ;  ). In addition, CTCF tends to localize nearby H3K4me3, and H3K27me3, which are established by TrxG and PRC2, respectively ( ;  ;  ). This could explain the enrichment of the two histone marks at CTCF binding sites containing SRA ( ). However, the majority of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 sites are associated neither with SRA nor CTCF, supporting the existence of multiple mechanisms for establishing these histone modifications. Further studies will be required to uncover possible synergistic regulation by lncRNAs and their protein binding partners in erythropoiesis. \n\nThere are growing evidence of various functions of lncRNAs in blood cells ( ;  ). During mouse embryonic hematopoiesis, the lncRNA H19 promotes gene expression program of hematopoiesis transcriptome-wide via regulation of promoter DNA methylation of key HSC genes, and is therefore critical for embryonic endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and generating embryonic HSCs in aorta-gonads-mesonephros ( ). The mouse lncRNA EC2, which is conserved in human, has been reported to facilitate expression of the erythroid marker Ter119 and enucleation of mouse erythroblasts ( ). In human, a transcriptome-wide analysis of erythroid-induced human HSCs has revealed expression of approximately 1,100 genes encoding lncRNAs. Of these, the expression level of 34 lncRNAs is correlated with that of protein coding genes involved in hematopoiesis, leukocyte activation and DNA repair in erythroblasts suggesting a possible function of these lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation of the associated genes ( ). Heme biosynthesis is erythroblasts mediated by the lncRNA UCA1, which is upregulated at the proerythroblast stage interacts with the ribonucleoprotein PTBP1 ( ). In another study, the lncRNA HMI (also called HMI-lncRNA), which is transiently induced during human erythropoiesis, is a negative regulator of gamma globin expression ( ). Intriguingly, using RNA-seq and ChIRP-seq approaches, the enhancer-associated lncRNA Bloodlinc has been reported to facilitate enucleation of mouse RBCs by inducing erythroid-related genes and repressing non-erythroid genes through direct binding to chromatin. Interestingly, similar to SRA, Bloodlinc also forms a complex with the RNA helicase DDX5 ( ), which is important for establishment of H3K4me3 ( ). Therefore, these findings have shed light on the function of these lncRNA transcripts in regulation of erythropoiesis. In conclusion, we have suggested the role of SRA in human erythropoiesis, as well as a direct transcriptional control of SRA in regulation of proerythroblast-associated genes. Together, our work supports the roles of lncRNAs in erythroblast gene regulation. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll relevant sequencing data has been uploaded to NCBI:   and  . \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nWS and PW conceived and designed the research, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.

In these turtle populations, the degree of heteroplasmic mutations commonly related with pathologies, has not been studied. In this data report, the specifications of each heteroplasmic site (region, mutation, length) and the percentage of heteroplasmy of each gene for four mitochondrial genomes of turtles (loggerhead: Cc1, Cc2, Cc3 and hawksbill: Ei1) are presented. The highest value of heteroplasmy in tRNA was of 83.33% for the Cc2 turtle (tRNA  gene), in protein coding genes was 38.62% for Cc2 (ND5), and in rRNA genes of 0.74% for Ei1 turtle (rRNA-16S). The variability data obtained will be useful for further conservation projects, evolution studies and population health of these species. This is the first study of heteroplasmy in complete mitogenomes of loggerhead and hawksbill turtles. \n \n\n# Body\n \n  \nSpecification Table \n    \n\n## Data description \n  \nThe hawksbill turtle,   Eretmochelys imbricata   and the loggerhead turtle,   Caretta caretta  , are distributed in tropical waters and, to a lesser extent, in subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans [ , ]. They are categorized by the IUCN as vulnerable species globally and in critical danger in Colombia [ ] ( ). The data information of each individual is shown in  . Using Hiseq 2000 platform the transcriptomes of the sea turtles were sequenced, the results are shown in  .   \nInformation for each examined sea turtle individual. \n  Table 1     \nLevel of heteroplasmy for each mitochondrial gene of the four individuals. \n  Table 2     \nSequencing data for each individual. \n  Table 3   \n\nThe importance of estimating the degree of heteroplasmy in organisms is the fact that mtDNA mutations can affect the functionality of mitochondria and generate pathologies of variable symptomatology [ , ]. \n\nThe level of heteroplasmy of each gene, that is, the percentage of mutated nucleotide positions with respect to their total amount, for each turtle is shown in  . The data of positions detailed changes and length of heteroplasmic mutations are shown in  . \n\nThe molecular mechanisms that cause heteroplasmy are not yet fully known, although there are five possibilities to explain the heteroplasmic variants presented here: maternal inheritance [ ], introgression of the paternal genetic material [ , ],   de novo   mutations [ , ], presence of nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) [ ] and sequencing errors (false heteroplasmy) [ ]. \n\n\n## Experimental design, materials, and methods \n  \n### Biological samples \n  \nBlood tissue samples from three loggerhead and one hawksbill sea turtles was obtained from the CEINER Oceanarium in San Martin de Pajares Island, Cartagena (10\u00b011\u2032N, 75\u00b047\u2032W). The blood was obtained from the dorsal cervical sinus in accordance with the Dutton [ ] methodology. The samples were placed in sterilized tubes with Tris-EDTA buffer 0.1 M solution (GreinerBio-one\u00ae, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria) and were transported at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to the Molecular Biology Lab of the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Bogota campus. The samples were collected following the ethical standards established by the legislation with the permission from the ethics committee of the UJTL, the Ministry of the Environment for the development of the Biodiversity research (No 24 of June 22, 2012) and the Genetic Resources Access contract (No April 64, 2013). The blood samples were used for total RNA extraction using RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). For mRNA library preparation, we used a TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, U.S.A.). The poly-A containing mRNAs were isolated using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. The first cDNA strand followed by a second cDNA strand was synthesized from purified mRNAs. End repair was performed followed by adenylation of 3 ends. Adapters were ligated and PCR was done to selectively enrich DNA fragments with adapters and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library, respectively. The quality control of generated libraries was performed using the 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, U.S.A.). RIN values (RNA integrity number) of 7.5 were obtained. The library was paired-end sequenced using Hiseq 2000 Platform. The quality of cleaned raw reads was verified with the fastQC program ( ). Sequencing data for each individual is presented in  . \n\n\n### Complete mitogenome determination \n  \nThe contigs of each transcriptomes were filtered to establish the complete mitogenome for the four turtles, aligning local data obtained from sequencing against the mitochondrial genomes for hawksbill and loggerhead (access number: JX454986 and NC_016923.1, respectively) reported in GenBank (NCBI). The alignment was performed using BLASTn. \n\nThe reads of the mitochondrial sequences of each loggerhead and hawksbill turtle were saved in FASTA format. Using the Geneious 6.1.6 program (Kearse et\u00a0al., 2012), all the reads for each individual were assembled using mitochondrial sequences of these turtles previously published as references (access numbers: JX454986 for hawksbill and NC_016923.1 for loggerhead turtles). For each consensus sequence, paired alignments were made with each of the 37 genes encoded by the mtDNA (reported in GenBank) using the BLAST refseq_genomic tool of the NCBI. This allowed the location of each gene within the consensus genome for each of the individuals studied. \n\nThe mitogenome sequences were published in GenBank database with the following access numbers: LMF554690.1, MF579504.1, MF579505.1 and MF571906.1 (Cc1, Cc2, Cc3 and Ei, respectively). \n\n\n### Identification of heteroplasmy \n  \nMultiple alignments were made with all the mtDNA reads of each individual and the reference mitochondrial genomes of hawksbill and loggerhead turtles reported in GenBank (access number: JX454986 and NC_016923.1, respectively), using the Geneious 6.1.6 program [ ]. This procedure allowed us to obtain the reads aligned in a way that enabled a comparison among them to determine the nucleotide variations in the mtDNA of each sea turtle, discarding interindividual variations. Because the sequencing depth was low (6X), only those positions in which the frequency of the second most frequent base was greater than or equal to 30% were taken into account in order to avoid false positives. Each possible heteroplasmic site was identified: nucleotide change (wild type and mutated sequences), location (site and gene in which it is found) and length of the heteroplasmic sequence ( ). \n\n\n\n## Funding sources \n  \nThis work was supported by the Office of Research, Creation and Extension of the  .

To date, there are no atomic models of Twinkle and it is the last member of the mitochondrial DNA replisome to be structurally characterized. Given that mutations in Twinkle helicase cause clinical effects, mapping the location of these residues is critical to understanding Twinkle-dependent mitochondria disease phenotypes. Here, we utilize cryo-electron microscopy to determine a full-length structure of Twinkle W315L in two oligomeric states. In addition to defining the location of the clinical mutations, we investigate flexibility at the interface and propose a model for the clinical effects of W315L. \n  \nTwinkle is the mammalian helicase vital for replication and integrity of mitochondrial DNA. Over 90 Twinkle helicase disease variants have been linked to progressive external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia neuropathies among other mitochondrial diseases. Despite the biological and clinical importance, Twinkle represents the only remaining component of the human minimal mitochondrial replisome that has yet to be structurally characterized. Here, we present 3-dimensional structures of human Twinkle W315L. Employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we characterize the oligomeric assemblies of human full-length Twinkle W315L, define its multimeric interface, and map clinical variants associated with Twinkle in inherited mitochondrial disease. Cryo-EM, crosslinking-mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into the dynamic movement and molecular consequences of the W315L clinical variant. Collectively, this ensemble of structures outlines a framework for studying Twinkle function in mitochondrial DNA replication and associated disease states. \n \n\n# Body\n \nThe human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome is 16.6 kb and encodes 13 proteins of the electron transport chain, 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs. The human mitochondrial replisome includes: (1) the polymerase, Pol\u03b3, composed of the catalytic subunit, POLG, and its accessory subunit, POLG2, (2) Twinkle, (3) mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein, and (4) the mitochondria-directed RNA polymerase (POLRMT) ( ,  ). Over 400 protein variants of this replisome have been shown to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of these proteins, Twinkle helicase variants lead to infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia and disease phenotypes characterized by neuromuscular dysfunction ( ,  ). The essential function of Twinkle is also highlighted through its embryonic lethality in conditional knockout mice ( ). Disease variants of Twinkle helicase can lead to increased mtDNA copy number ( ), mtDNA depletion, and accumulation of replication intermediates ( ). \n\nTwinkle, a Superfamily 4 (SF4) helicase, catalyzes nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis and unwinds DNA substrates with 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 polarity ( ,  ). Structurally, Twinkle is generally defined by: (1) an N-terminal region (NTR), (2) a primase-like domain, (3) a linker region, and (4) a C-terminal helicase domain ( ). It is predicted that Twinkle shares overall fold similarity with other members of the SF4 helicases, such as T7 replicative helicase (gp4) with which it shares 46% sequence similarity and 15% identity. Most of the similarity is contained within the helicase domain ( ). Similar to other SF4 helicases, structural models and biochemical data predict that Twinkle exists in various oligomeric states and undergoes oligomeric transitions [reviewed in ( )]. \n  \nTwinkle W315L analysis for structural studies. (  A  ) Schematic of the Twinkle construct used in this study. Transport of Twinkle to the mitochondria removes the predicted mitochondrial transport sequence (MTS) producing Twinkle helicase (43-684), Twinkle FL \u0394MTS). Twinkle domain structure consists of an N-terminal region (NTR) (light peach), a primase-like domain (light orange), and a C-terminal helicase domain (bright red). (  B  ) Representative cryo-EM micrograph with scale bar (white). (  C  ) Example cryo-EM 2D class averages of a heptamer and octamer Twinkle helicase. (  D   and   E  ) Cryo-EM density maps of (  D  ) heptamer (blue-gray) and (  E  ) octamer (salmon) colored with size measurements indicated in angstroms of the lumen and width as measured in IMOD ( ). \n  \nDespite sequence similarity in the C-terminus, the NTR and the primase-like domain of Twinkle lack critical residues to form zinc finger DNA binding domain and the residues central to primase function that are found within gp4 and other SF4 helicases ( ). Thus, the N-terminal regions of Twinkle are poorly modeled ( ). Although the quaternary assembly of Twinkle remains unclear, biochemical studies indicate that the NTR of Twinkle is susceptible to proteolysis and is, at least partially, responsible for DNA binding and oligomerization ( \u2013 ). The lack of high-resolution structural knowledge has hampered a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Twinkle helicase and Twinkle-dependent mtDNA deletions and mitochondrial disease. \n\nHere, we present structures of human Twinkle helicase using the W315L disease variant. Obtained without crosslinking, the full-length (FL) human Twinkle W315L structures reveal distinct oligomeric states: heptamer and octamer. Both states of Twinkle W315L are refined and presented in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps with areas of high local resolution \u223c3.2 and 2.9 \u00c5 and \u223c4.5 and \u223c3.9 \u00c5 global map resolution for heptamers and octamers, respectively. These oligomeric structures are supported through crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). Our structures reveal a conformational assembly that is distinct from other known SF4 helicase conformations. Utilizing the cryo-EM-derived structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations define molecular details of wild-type (WT) Twinkle and the clinically identified W315L variant. Furthermore, our results provide spatial locations of disease variants and structural basis for dysfunctional mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication observed in patients with Twinkle-associated mitochondrial diseases. \n\n## Results \n  \n### Purification and Assembly of Multimeric Human Twinkle. \n  \nPrevious oligomeric assessments show WT and W315L eluting at high-molecular weight by size-exclusion chromatography ( ). Both display a similar heptameric conformation upon negative stain EM, while WT also displays hexamers ( ). Variable effects of W315L substitution on DNA helicase function   in\u00a0vitro   have been reported and likely arise from differential assay sensitivities, reaction conditions, and DNA substrates ( ,  ,  ). To aid in our understanding of autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) resulting from mutations in c10orf2 (  TWNK   gene), we expressed full-length human W315L Twinkle (C-terminal his-tag \u039442, FL residues 43\u2013684, 73 kDa) ( ) in   Escherichia coli   ( ), which we call Twinkle below. Detergents and glycerol, which have been among the common additives to aid WT and mutant Twinkle stability, have been removed ( ,  ,  ). These additives often reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in micrographs, interfering with high-resolution cryo-EM ( ). Our modified protocol (  and  ) permitted purification of Twinkle W315L in amounts and purity amenable to high-resolution structural analysis ( ). \n\nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) of Twinkle in the absence (APO) and presence (DNA bound) of \u201cFORK1\u201d replication fork DNA ( ) confirmed self-assembly of high-molecular weight Twinkle W315L species, as previously observed ( ). SEC-MALS profiles show the elution of the APO form at 13.66 mL with a derived molecular weight (MW) of 606 kDa that approximates an octameric species of Twinkle W315L. The DNA bound form had a small shift in peak elution to 13.38 mL with a derived MW of 503 kDa ( ). This reduced size approximates Twinkle species bound to FORK1 DNA following a monomer loss, which supports the hypothesis that Twinkle oligomers eject one monomer upon binding DNA ( ). \n\n\n### High-Resolution Cryo-EM of Human Twinkle FL. \n  \nA straightforward purification of Twinkle and confidence in oligomeric assembly allowed for the vitrification, sample imaging, subsequent cryo-EM data collection ( ), and single-particle analysis (  and  ) of Twinkle W315L. Twinkle W315L particles are discernible on micrographs ( ), and data processing of two-dimensional (2D) classes ( ) indicate a mixture of oligomeric states distributed among heptamers (\u223c30%), octamers (27%), oligomers containing DNA (23%), and broken rings of variable size (19%) (  and  ). Although grids were prepared with samples containing FORK1 DNA and AMP-PNP, high orientation bias in the particle distribution of the DNA-bound species lead to low-resolution 3D reconstruction and precluded the generation of final 3D models. However, despite the oligomeric heterogeneity, possibly accentuated by the absence of crosslinking agents, cryo-EM clearly captures two distinct high-resolution APO oligomeric states, heptamer and octamer (  and  ). \n\nFollowing 2D and 3D classifications, the FSC (0.143) of the cryo-EM map of Twinkle W315L octamer and heptamer defined a global resolution \u223c3.9 \u00c5 and \u223c4.5 \u00c5, respectively (C8, octamer EMD ID: 25743 and C7, heptamer EMD ID: 25744) ( ). In these oligomeric assemblies, Twinkle W315L forms a ring-like structure ( ,  ,  ). The heptamer has an outer diameter of \u223c193 \u00c5 and an inner lumen diameter of \u223c26 \u00c5, and the octamer has an outer diameter of \u223c203 \u00c5 and an inner lumen diameter of \u223c33 \u00c5 ( ). The local resolution of the structure lies largely between \u223c3.8\u20134.1 \u00c5 (heptamer) and \u223c2.9\u20133.8 \u00c5 (octamer), with regions of presumably increased mobility at lower resolution, such as regions at the top and bottom of the ring ( ). Given the mobility of Twinkle in these regions and the lack of visual differences between individual monomers within the multimeric species, local refinement of the octamer was performed by masking a dimer unit and defining a fulcrum point at the center of the mask. The particles within each defining oligomeric structure were subject to symmetry expansion. With no applied symmetry (i.e., C1), the octameric cryo-EM map global resolution is \u223c3.8 \u00c5 with local resolution ranging from \u223c2.9 \u00c5 to 3.5 \u00c5 ( , EMD ID: 25746). The dimer map has improved resolution particularly in the regions forming the interior lumen of Twinkle. \n\n\n### Twinkle Ensemble. \n  \nGiven that there are no published structures of human Twinkle or homologs, we utilized the AlphaFold software and database ( ) to generate models of both Twinkle W315L (AlphaFold software) and WT (AlphaFold database) as starting models for refinement ( ). To investigate the structural details of Twinkle helicase W315L, we built and refined heptameric and octameric atomic models within the cryo-EM maps. We modeled seven asymmetric units into the heptameric cryo-EM map (PDB ID: 7T8C, EMD ID: 25744) (  and  ) and we modeled eight asymmetric units into the octameric cryo-EM density (PDB ID: 7T8B, EMD ID: 25743) ( ). The locally refined C1 map (EMD ID: 25746) was used to ensure model completeness. The density we observe for both the heptamer and octamer populations ( , respectively) are well-fit by the Twinkle sequence. The Twinkle W315L structures are oligomeric ensembles of monomers containing \u201chead\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d regions that assemble in head-to-tail fashion to form a ring ( ). There is no observable density for residues 43\u201353, 85\u201398, 132\u2013146, 227\u2013230, and 633\u2013684 or for the C-terminal his-tag. This absence of density is consistent with the disorder predicted for these regions by AlphaFold ( ) ( ) as well as DISOPRED, a disorder prediction software ( ) ( ). \n  \nOverview of W315L Twinkle helicase structure.(  A  ) Top view of DeepEMhancer cryo-EM map of Twinkle helicase heptamer (EMD ID: 25744) (blue) fit with PDB ID: 7T8C (cartoon representation).

(  D  ) (  Left  ) Schematic of Twinkle subdomains mapped with cartoon representations of cylindrical helices. The cylindrical representation is colored as in (  C  ), and the asterisk indicates the location of the helix containing W315L. (  Right  ) The cryo-EM map (mesh) (EMD ID: 25743) fit with the PDB ID: 7T8B cartoon representation of the helix containing W315L. Residues are shown in stick representation. The asterisk is maintained in the same position in (  D  ) and (  B  ). \n  \nThe asymmetric units within the heptamer and octamer structures are nearly identical Twinkle monomers and chains A from each oligomer align with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.228 \u00c5 ( ). Twinkle monomers within our Twinkle W315L ensembles are separated into three discrete subdomain regions: NTR (residues 54\u2013131, light peach), primase-like domain and linker (residues 147\u2013388, light orange), and C-terminal domain (residues 389\u2013633, bright red) (  and  ). Additionally, the C-terminal domain stacks onto the N-terminal domain within each discrete monomer unit ( ). The Twinkle clinical variant W315L resides in the primase-like domain, and the helix containing W315L is well-occupied within the cryo-EM map ( ). The positions of local residues surrounding W315L in the heptamer and octamer assemblies are remarkably similar ( ), indicating that structural features are shared within the asymmetric units of both assemblies. \n\n\n### Crosslinking Mass Spectrometry of Twinkle Helicase. \n  \nTo validate our cryo-EM-derived model of Twinkle W315L, we performed chemical XL-MS. Under reducing SDS-PAGE conditions, bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3d0) crosslinking yielded higher MW bands consistent with multimers, in addition to a \u223c73 kDa band for the noncrosslinked protein ( ). In the samples analyzed by MS, there were 55 crosslinks and 27 unique crosslinks observed and well-defined ( ). The Twinkle helicase sequence has an additional 19 lysine residues that were not observed in XL-MS data, highlighting the specificity of BS3d0 as a lysine-lysine crosslinker in this analysis. A XiNET plot displays all nonambiguous crosslinks ( ) ( ). The crosslinks were mapped onto the protein sequence and show clustering in three general regions. Using PDB ID: 7T8B chain B, the majority (88%) of crosslinks occurred within an acceptable region, defined by a cutoff of C\u03b1-C\u03b1 \u226430 \u00c5 ( ) ( \u2013 ). Within the permitted regions, crosslinks occurring near the multimerization interface are of particular interest. For example, crosslinks involving K319, K324, K328, and K365 ( ) are all located within the predicted 12 \u00c5 region of BS3d0 and agree with the cryo-EM derived structures of Twinkle W315L. Each of the crosslinks occurring outside this cutoff is in connection to one residue, K593. Furthermore, the distances of crosslinking to this residue remain outside the cutoff in the context of both intra- and interdomain crosslinking. This residue is in the central lumen of the ring within the cryo-EM maps of Twinkle W315L, perhaps indicating flexibility in this region. A less populated conformation, not resolved to high-resolution in the cryo-EM analysis, could also explain the presence of this crosslink. \n  \nXL-MS of Twinkle helicase W315L.

(  Right  ) Crosslinked lysine side chains (sticks) near the multimerization interface are shown. \n  \n\n### Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Conformational Flexibility, Stability, and Dynamic Changes. \n  \nTo understand the potential impact of the W315L clinical variant on the structure of Twinkle helicase, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two simplified systems: (1) a dimer system (chain A and chain B), and (2) a monomer system (chain A) ( ). We analyzed several parameters: RMSD, root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF), and calculated dynamic cross correlation matrices (DCCM). The RMSD\u00a0profile of Twinkle W315L as compared to WT is relatively unchanged within the dimer system ( ). Similar deviations from the starting structures indicate the overall stability of both dimer systems is comparable. When treated as free monomers or monomer systems within a dimer, both systems are again stable ( ). When we truncate Twinkle in our system to remove the NTR (residues 56\u2013149), we observe a slight decrease of RMSD\u00a0values and therefore a mild increase in stability of the rest of the protein (compare  ). Meanwhile, the values of RMSDs calculated only from the NTR are increased for both WT and W315L in the monomer and dimer systems ( ), indicating potential flexibility in the NTR. \n  \nTwinkle W315L oligomeric interface. Throughout the figure chain A of Twinkle is light gray blue and chain B is dark gray blue, in schematic a when displaying the oligomer chains c\u2013g are colored alternating these same colors.

(  Bottom  ) Zoom-in of the average RMSF plots of the C\u03b1 atoms for chain A (  Left  ) and chain B (  Right  ) of W315L calculated over the entire MD trajectory. X-axis is a schematic of the relevant domains of Twinkle and residue numbering. Arrows indicate the region on the schematic of an asymmetric unit pertaining to residues \u223c360\u2013390 in the \u201ctail region\u201d of the Twinkle monomer for both chain A and chain B in a simplified dimer system. (  C  ) A tilted view surface representation of Twinkle heptamer (PDB ID: 7T8C) and a black box highlights a cylindrical representation of two asymmetric units. The Twinkle heptamer is rotated to a side view of Twinkle, and a black box highlights the interface between asymmetric units. The asymmetric unit has a height of 60 \u00c5 as determined in Chimera. (  Right  ) Zoom-in on the interface of chain A and chain B of PDB ID: 7T8C. Residues shown in stick representation are previously identified Twinkle clinical mutations ( ). (  D  ) A histogram of per-residue MM-GBSA binding energies of clinical variants at the interface of two asymmetric units of W315L.   y   axis represents the binding energies, and error bars are SE. \n  \nWe then explored the dynamic behavior of individual residues through analysis of RMSF\u00a0of the \u03b1-carbons to predict local residue movement (  and  ). There are negligible differences among the fluctuations when comparing chains A and B of both WT and W315L, with the exception of residues \u223c365 through 385, the \u201ctail region\u201d (  and  ,   Middle Panels  ) and to a lesser extent residues \u223c460 through 495, the \u201chead\u201d region ( ,   Lower Panels  ). When the respective region is unengaged or unrestrained there is an elevated RMSF, conversely when it is restrained by the presence of a subsequent monomer, there is a decreased in RMSF. For example, when the tail (residues \u223c365\u2013385) of chain A is unrestrained, there is a high RMSF\u00a0( ,   Left  ), however, when the tail of chain B is bound to the head of chain A in an oligomer there is a reduction in RMSF\u00a0at the interface ( ,   Right   and  ,   Middle Panel  ). Consistent with this observation, the monomer system has an elevated RMSF\u00a0in both the head and tail region ( ). \n\nFor additional insight into the dynamics of Twinkle WT and W315L, dynamic correlation was evaluated on the MD trajectories of WT and W315L ( ). Dynamic correlation is reflective of the communication among various sub elements via \u03b1-carbons across the entire protein backbone. For Twinkle WT and W315L dimer and monomer systems, we clearly observe correlative movement indicative of three distinct subdomains within each chain, and residue numbering correlates well with the cryo-EM defined boundaries: NTR, primase-like domain, and the helicase domain ( ). Here, WT exhibits marginally increased anti-correlative motions, or more flexibility as compared to W315L ( ). Although there is anti-correlative movement, in the dimer systems, the local environment surrounding residue 315 in both W315 (WT) and W315L displays no major differences in local interaction frequencies in this region ( ). From our MD simulations, we can see both WT and W315L systems are globally stable with regions of inherent flexibility. \n\n\n### Molecular Details of Twinkle Helicase Functioning. \n  \nGuided by these structural features, molecular dynamics and cryo-EM become particularly advantageous to visualize specific residues and critical areas of Twinkle, such as the active site, oligomerization interfaces, and clinical mutations. Sequence and structural alignments of Twinkle and gp4 provide insight into the features of the active site, include the Walker A and B motifs (K421, E445, and D516), and the \u201carginine finger\u201d R609 ( ). While the NTP binding site of Twinkle is unoccupied, the residues necessary for nucleotide hydrolysis and NTP engagement are spatially assembled, and R609 is important for the interaction between subunits ( ). Alignments of T7 helicase structure APO structure of the helicase-primase K318M mutant (PDB ID: 1Q57, gp4 residues 64\u2013549), helicase E343Q catalytic mutant bound to single-strand DNA, and Mg , dTTP (PDB ID: 6N7N, residues 264\u2013549), Twinkle heptamer (PDB ID: 7T8C) and octamer (PDB ID: 7T8B, chains A) reveal similar active site assemblies ( ). \n\nThese Twinkle W315L cryo-EM models also permit the mapping of an extensive interface between the \u201chead\u201d region (residues 448\u2013459 and 464\u2013479) and the \u201ctail\u201d region (residues 369\u2013383) of the next monomer chain B ( , heptamer). Comparing the dimer interfaces of the heptamer and octamer assemblies demonstrates that the interface is largely maintained and that global alignment of two asymmetric units has an RMSD\u00a0of 0.288A ( ). More than 25 known missense mutations reside within the helices that form the subunit interface, and most of these variant Twinkle proteins have been shown in biochemical assays to interfere with multimerization or to reduce DNA helicase or ATPase activities ( ,  ). Furthermore, at least 10 clinical missense variants directly align with the subunit interface in both the heptamer and the octamer (  and  ). Residues at the interface also display high frequencies of interaction (  [chain B residues] and   [chain A residues]). For example, the fractional occupancies of interdomain interactions for residues S369, F370, R374, L381 (chain B), F478, E479, and F485 (chain A) are between 0.921\u20131.000 for both WT and W315L Twinkle, indicating these residues are nearly always participating in the subunit interface. It is also apparent from molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) or binding energy analysis that residues at the interface have large negative energies ( ), including those implicated in clinical disease presentation ( ). The binding energy analysis highlights the importance of these residues in assembly of Twinkle. \n\nOne of the most devastating clinical mutations of Twinkle is Y508C. Interestingly, Y508 is situated at the nexus of the N-terminal and C-terminal domain interface and it is also closely positioned to I367 (chain A) of the subsequent monomer (i.e., chain B), ( ). The negative binding energies and high frequency of interaction of Y508 (chain A) ( ) and I367 (chain B) ( ) in MD simulations further support the notion that proper assembly of this region is critical for monomer formation, as well as oligomeric assembly. It is worth noting that in this region, I367T and V507I are also clinical variants associated with adPEO and Perrault syndrome 5, respectively. In total, the structures defined in this study also permitted the mapping of \u223c93% of disease-associated Twinkle mutations identified in Peter et\u00a0al. ( ) ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Architecture of Twinkle Helicase. \n  \nWe determined structures of the human mitochondrial replicative helicase, Twinkle W315L. The W315L disease variant structures illustrate the interface between Twinkle subunits and reveal contacts that are critical for the assembly of the oligomeric ring structure. Our cryo-EM structures display the primase-like domain stacking on the NTR within each monomer. Although our structures resemble previous 2D class analyses for Twinkle ( ), their domain arrangement differs from a previously proposed Twinkle model ( ). We did attempt to model a conformation of Twinkle in which the primase domain is rotated and positioned under the helicase domain of the adjacent monomer in the ring assembly, but this conformation did not fit appropriately into the cryo-EM map. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that the addition of NTPs and decreased ionic strength \u201ccompacts\u201d Twinkle WT ( ,  ). In contrast, W315L was not observed to have NTP-induced conformational changes. In these studies, 2D classes, under crosslinking conditions, display an NTR and/or primase-like domain folded inward toward the ring ( ). In our study, the 2D classes and 3D structures of Twinkle W315L are consistent with a \u201ccompacted\u201d conformation. While we cannot exclude that the presence of AMP-PNP in our sample is driving this compaction, we also do not observe a transition from open to extended conformations of Twinkle W315L, consistent with previous analysis. Additionally, Peter et\u00a0al. ( ) states that the \u201copen\u201d or star conformation of WT is unlikely to exist in\u00a0vivo, but it likely implies an inherent flexibility that is absent in W315L. Our MD simulations systems indicate minor stability increases for W315L over WT (e.g., DCCM,  ). If WT Twinkle has a propensity to sample an open conformation more frequently in\u00a0vitro, this could contribute to the decreased solubility and increased aggregation observed by numerous researchers ( ,  ). We suggest this inherent flexibility of WT Twinkle frustrated our previous structural efforts, whereas the relative stability of the W315L Twinkle enabled determination of structures with all domains visible in the oligomeric assemblies. \n\n\n### Oligomer Selection. \n  \nPrevious Twinkle models and descriptions of adPEO mutations have invoked altered flexibility and varied oligomeric states. Twinkle monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers (82%) and larger oligomers (18%) have been observed by atomic force microscopy ( ). Heterogenous mixtures of hexamer, heptamer, and broken rings were revealed by negative stain EM ( ), and by cryo-EM, and hexamers have been observed after high salt GraFix and crosslinking ( ). The environment and methods of protein purification may have generated these inconsistencies. Here, we have taken care to remove DNA from original purifications, to maintain salt conditions that closely resemble   in\u00a0vivo   salt conditions, to eliminate detergents in sample buffers and to avoid biases associated with population selection or crosslinking. Perhaps the relative rigidity of the Twinkle W315L interface leads to a more conformationally homogenous population of Twinkle and promotes the appearance of an octamer population. The MD simulations data in this study, along with the cryo-EM and SEC-MALS data, suggest that flexibility at the interface of the oligomeric species may allow for monomer exchange. Similarly, the flexibility observed at the interface may facilitate ring opening. In support of this, S369P and L381P substitutions at the subunit interface show increased broken rings ( ). Our structures support biological observations that mutations to residues such as R374 (the highest binding energy to the dimer interface  ) and Y508C would dramatically impact the ability of Twinkle to properly assemble. \n\nHere, we compare atomic models of Twinkle in light of the well-characterized T7 gp4 structures, both in the absence and presence of the replisome components. Thus far, high-resolution structures of T7 gp4 have primarily analyzed the primase and helicase domains in the absence of the zinc finger binding domain (ZBD) [e.g., PDB IDs: 1Q57, primase-helicase; heptamer, ( ); 1E0K, helicase ( ); 5IKN, primase-helicase ( ); and 1CR2, helicase ( )]. In the absence of the NTR, gp4 structures display primarily hexamers, although a heptamer was also observed in crystallization ( ). Biochemical analysis suggests that the ZBD of T7 gp4 is inhibitory to hexamer formation and diffraction-competent crystals ( ,  ). \n\nIt is interesting to postulate whether the NTR is inhibitory for Twinkle as well. If this is correct, then the removal of the Twinkle NTR might also produce a dramatic population shift toward a hexamer. Likewise, ZBD-primase domains of T7 gp4 have been resolved in structural studies [X-ray crystallography, PDB ID: 1NUI ( ); ZBD-primase and cryo-EM, PDB ID: 6N9U ( ); one ZBD, residues 9\u201345; and 2 primase domains residues (1) 64\u2013209/218\u2013260 and (2) 64\u2013260], but the position of each ZBD within an oligomer assembly is largely unknown. \n\nThe Twinkle helicase conformation(s) in complex with the other members of the mitochondria replisome is, to our knowledge, unexplored. The T7 gp4 helicase-primase PDB ID: 5IKN vs. 1Q57 replisome structures describe nearly identical positioning in the presence and absence of additional replisome factors with an RMSD\u00a0of 3.4 \u00c5. It is also possible, as Peter et\u00a0al. ( ) proposed, that the C-terminus of Twinkle interacts with the other replisome components. Given that the C terminus is partially solvent exposed perhaps the current conformation of Twinkle is competent for protein-protein interaction. Experimental evidence of these interactions is under investigation. \n\n\n### Unrestrained Movement and Movement along DNA. \n  \nTheories of helicase engagement and movement along DNA would support the need for sampling a broken ring conformation of Twinkle and sampling unrestrained movement observed in MD simulations. Similar unrestrained movement and open ring formation has been observed in the AFM study of Twinkle helicase ( ) and high-resolution structural studies of T7 gp4 [e.g., PDB ID: 6N7I ( )]. Here, the observed change of MW calculated by SEC-MALS, in the presence of FORK1 DNA, is highly reminiscent of the ejection theory, whereby Twinkle helicase releases a monomeric subunit upon DNA binding. The clinical presentation of Twinkle W315L may arise from a dysfunction in DNA loading, whereby the oligomeric population would have subsequent rounds of monomer ejection, ejecting two molecules (APO octamer to DNA-bound hexamer) ( ). Additional structural studies will be needed to characterize the mechanism of Twinkle helicase movement along DNA, in the context of adPEO clinical variants and WT. While it is possible that the diameter of the lumen observed in our Twinkle structures could accommodate both the single-strand and double-strand elements of the DNA fork, we do not observe unmodeled density in the ring-like 3D reconstructions that could account for the presence of DNA. Under the present conditions, the Twinkle-DNA bound species in our cryo-EM dataset suggest that the structure underwent a large-scale conformational change, but did not yield a high-resolution map due to orientation bias in the projection distribution ( ). Previously, work has shown that Twinkle helicase is capable of binding DNA in the absence of cofactors ( ,  ) and here, the sample reaction assembly was designed similarly to Patel and colleagues ( ), in which helicase activity would begin with the addition of Mg . Future studies are needed to further explore the conformational changes and biochemical properties in cryo-EM of Twinkle in the presence and absence of cofactors, metals, and nucleic acids. \n  \nProposed model of Twinkle WT and W315L octamer-heptamer monomer ejection. The loss of one (WT/W315L) or two monomer (W315L) units is required for DNA binding. Each attempt to bind DNA allows for ring opening and unrestrained movement exploiting the inherent flexibility of Twinkle. Twinkle top views are shown in cartoon surface representation for the heptamer (blue) and octamer (pink). Tilted views are shown using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) electrostatics plugin of PyMOL onto the surface representation of both oligomeric assemblies. 3D surface cartoon representation color-coded electrostatic surface \u22125 (red) to +5 (blue) K T/e . \n  \n\n### Summary. \n  \nOverall, this study unveils high-resolution structures of Twinkle helicase as both a heptamer and an octamer. We are now able to accurately map nearly all clinically identified Twinkle variants. XL-MS experiments and MD simulations further support the cryo-EM structure. How Twinkle helicase assembles within the mitochondrial replisome, identification of protein-to-protein or protein-to-DNA contacts, and how Twinkle dysfunction promotes replisome-dependent stalling and ultimately the formation of mtDNA deletions are ongoing investigations. We anticipate this study will elicit subsequent investigations of the conformational changes identifying additional states of Twinkle helicase, as well as assembly within the replisome. Furthermore, this study provides a platform for targeted therapies in the treatment of Twinkle-associated diseases such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Perrault syndrome, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia/IOSCA, and hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Plasmids and Expression. \n  \nTwinkle W315L plasmid pT684\u039442C-His, previously described ( ), was transformed in Rosetta2 (DE3) (Millipore). Cultures were grown in terrific broth to an OD  of \u223c2 and induced with 0.2 mM IPTG. Cultures were incubated overnight at 16\u2009\u00b0C and shaking at 180 rpm. Of note, these analyses described here were also attempted for Twinkle WT, but, as is well-established, solubility prevented further analysis. Therefore, for simplicity, W315L is referred to as Twinkle. \n\n\n### W315L Purification. \n  \nBacterial pellet was resuspended in cold lysis buffer (25 mL/L culture) (25 mM Hepes pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 40 mM imidazole) and cells were disrupted on ice by sonication until homogenous. The crude cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20 k \u00d7   g  , 4\u2009\u00b0C and applied to a fresh 5 mL Ni-NTA HP column (Cytiva). After washing the column with lysis buffer and lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, protein was eluted in 5 mL fractions of no Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The purest fractions were pooled and diluted to 250 mM NaCl and loaded on a fresh 1 mL heparin HP column (Cytiva). The protein was eluted in a linear gradient 15 CV Buffer A (25 mM Hepes pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP) to Buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 1 M NaCl) in 2-mL fractions. For cryo-EM, the peak fraction was dialyzed at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 1 h in Buffer A. For SEC-MALS, fractions containing the purest protein were supplemented with 50 mM imidazole and 50 mM NaCl, concentrated to 5 mL using Amicon filter 50 K cutoff (Millipore) and injected on a SEC S200 16/60 hi-prep column (Cytiva) in Twinkle imidazole buffer (25 mM Hepes pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP). All proteins used in biochemical assays were flash frozen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Proteins for SEC-MALS were \u201cpolished\u201d over an S200 column in Twinkle imidazole buffer prior to SEC-MALS experiments. Cryo-EM grids were prepared from freshly purified protein. \n\n\n### DNA Substrate Complex Formation. \n  \nFork1 substrate was incubated at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5 min and annealed by slowly decreased to room temperature in 1\u00d7 annealing buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA). DNA fork substrate was previously described ( ) and contains the following oligonucleotides: (1) dscrandom44: ACTTGAATGCGGCTTAGTATGCATTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGC, (2) TSTEM GCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCG, and (3) U25 CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACC (Integrated DNA Technologies). \n\n\n### Cryo-EM Freezing and Sample and Grid Preparation. \n  \nA 2-nm carbon film was evaporated on G-flat R1.2/1.3 (Protochips, Inc) using a Leica ACE600. Grids were glow-discharged on both sides for 30 s, 15 mA using a Pelco EasiGlow at 0.38 mBar. 3 \u03bcL of buffer (220 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes pH 8, 0.5 mM TCEP) was applied to the back side of the grid. The Twinkle reaction (3 \u03bcL) containing freshly purified Twinkle W315L \u0394MTS (43-684) (\u223c1.2\u20131.8 mg/mL) with 1 mM \u03b2,\u03b3-imidoadenosine 5\u2032-triphophate lithium salt hydrate (Sigma Aldrich), 20 \u03bcM Fork1 DNA diluted with 250 mM NaCl, and 25 mM Hepes pH 8, 0.5 mM TCEP which was preincubated for 1 h on ice was applied to the front side. Excess liquid was blotted for 3\u20134 s, blotting force of \u22121, 95% humidity, and 12\u2009\u00b0C using a Vitrobot Mark II (Thermo Fisher) and plunged into liquid ethane. \n\n\n### Cryo-EM Data Collection, Processing, and Refinement. \n  \nDatasets were collected on a Talos Arctica microscope (Thermo Fisher) at 200 kV using a K2 camera (Gatan Inc.) at a pixel size of 0.932 \u00c5/px and on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher) at 300 kV equipped with a bio-quantum energy filter (Gatan Inc) and either a K2 or a K3 detector (Gatan Inc) at a super resolution pixel size of 0.529 \u00c5/px at 0 and 30\u00b0 tilt angle ( ). Movies from all datasets were aligned using MotionCor2 ( ) using 5 \u00d7 5 tiles and binned to a common pixel size of 1.058 \u00c5/px. Aligned micrographs were imported and processed into CryoSPARC v3.0 ( ). Final maps were sharpened using DeepEMhancer ( ). Atomic models were built into the maps with Chimera ( ), Coot ( ), Phenix ( ), and PyMOL ( ). \n\n\n### Chemical Crosslinking and Mass Spectrometry. \n  \nTwinkle W315L (7 \u03bcM, monomer) was incubated with 1X annealing buffer or FORK1 DNA for 15 min. Crosslinking reactions started upon the addition of BS3d0 to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched with the addition of Tris pH 8 (20 mM final) followed by 15 min on ice. For sample to be run on SDS-PAGE gel, Laemmli buffer was added prior to loading on to 4\u201312% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Mass Spectrometry analysis was performed as described in reference ( ). 10 \u03bcL of the crosslinked complex was digested by addition of 10 \u03bcL trypsin/LysC mix (0.11 \u03bcg/\u03bcL - Promega) and held overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Digests were stored at -80\u2009\u00b0C for subsequent MS analysis. Protein digests were analyzed by LC/MS on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with an M-Class nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation) equipped with a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 mm HSS T3 C18 column (1.8 \u03bcm particle, Waters Corporation) and a C18 trapping column (180 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 mm) with 5-\u03bcm particle size at a flow rate of 450 nL/min. The trapping column was in-line with the analytical column and upstream of a microtee union which was used for venting, trapping, and as a liquid junction. Trapping was performed using the initial solvent composition. 5 \u03bcL of digested sample was injected onto the column. Peptides were eluted by using a linear gradient from 99% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water [vol/vol]) and 1% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile [vol/vol]) to 40% solvent B over 70 min. For the mass spectrometry, a top\u2013ten data-dependent acquisition method was employed with a dynamic exclusion time of 15 s and exclusion of singly charged species. The mass spectrometer was employed with a nanoflex source with a stainless-steel needle and used in the positive ion mode. Instrument parameters were as follows: sheath gas, 0; auxiliary gas, 0; sweep gas, 0; spray voltage, 2.7 kV; capillary temperature, 275\u2009\u00b0C; S-lens, 60; scan range (  m/z  ) of 375\u20131,500; 1.6   m/z   isolation window; resolution: 70,000 (MS), 17,500 (MS/MS); automated gain control (AGC), 3 \u00d7 10e  ions (MS), 5 \u00d7 10e  (MS/MS); and a maximum IT of 100 ms (MS), 50 ms (MS/MS). Mass calibration was performed before data acquisition using the Pierce LTQ Velos Positive Ion Calibration mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The LC/MS raw data were first converted to an MGF format using Mascot Distiller from Matrix Science and then analyzed using the Batch-Tag Web function of the ProteinProspector web-based software developed by the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility. The MGF file was searched against sequences for the recombinant Twinkle Helicase by employing the User Protein Sequence field with other search parameters including: tryptic specificity and three missed cleavages; precursor charge range of 2, 3, 4, and 5; monoisotopic values; parent mass tolerance of 20 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 50 ppm; oxidation of methionine as a variable modification; and in the Crosslinking field, the Link Search Type was defined as DSS. The putative crosslinked peptide output was triaged by limiting the mass error of putative crosslinks to two SDs from the average error (\u223c5 ppm); requiring a Score Difference value >4 except for the cases of intermolecular crosslinks of identical peptides or peptides \u22643 amino acid residues; and total expectation values below 1 \u00d7 10 . \n\n\n### Molecular Dynamics Simulations. \n  \nThe initial model of the WT system was constructed by mutating L315 to W using Coot. For the preparation of starting configurations of molecular dynamics trajectories, which were based on PDB ID: 7T8B, missing protons were introduced by using the leap module of Amber.18 ( ), six Na  counter ions were added to the dimer system, and the systems were solvated in a box of TIP3P water ( ) with the box boundary extending to 20 \u00c5 from the nearest protein atom (resulting in a total of 186,579 atoms in the rectangular simulation box). Based on their local environment (by manually examining the potential for making hydrogen bonds with the neighboring residues), histidine residues 67, 405, 503, 512, and 552 were selected to be \u03b4-protonated while the rest of the histidine residues were \u03b5-protonated. There were 102 Na  and 102 Cl  ions added to the solution providing the 100 mM effective salt concentration closer to the physiological conditions. Prior to equilibration, the solvated system was sequentially subjected to (1) 500 ps of dynamics of water and all ions with fixed (or frozen) protein, (2) 5,000 steps of energy minimization of all atoms (the first 2,000 steps with the steepest descent method followed by the conjugate gradient method for the rest), (3) an initial constant temperature (300 K) \u2212 constant pressure (at 1 atm with the isotropic position scaling) dynamics at fixed protein to assure a reasonable starting density (\u223c1 ns) while keeping the protein positions under constraints with a 10 kcal/mol force constant for 50 ps, (4) a conjugate-gradient minimization for 1,000 steps, (5) step-wise heating (from 0 to 300 K in 3 ns) MD at constant volume, and (6) constant volume simulation for 10 ns with a constraint force constant of 10 kcal/mol applied only on backbone heavy atoms. After releasing all constraining forces within the next 40 ns equilibration period, sampling was increased by performing 5 independent molecular dynamics simulations for 1.20 \u03bcs at constant temperature (300 K) and constant volume. The constant temperature was maintained using the Langevin dynamics with the collision frequency of 0.5 ps . A similar protocol was adopted for the five 1.20 \u03bcs trajectories of both the Twinkle WT and W315L. The box dimensions were around 137.49 \u00c5 \u00d7 111.23 \u00c5 \u00d7 124.15 \u00c5. For monomer simulations, three Na  counterions were added. There were additional 84 Na  ions and 84 Cl  ions providing an effective salt concentration of 100 mM. Total number of atoms of the WT-monomer system was 147,576. Five 1.20 \u03bcs independent simulations were performed for each of the WT and the W315L monomer systems. All trajectories were calculated using the PMEMD module of Amber.18 with 1-fs time step. Long-range coulombic interactions were handled using the PME method ( ) with the cutoff of 10 \u00c5 for the direct interactions. The amino acid parameters were selected from the FF14SB force field ( ,  ) of Amber.18. RMSD, RMSF, dynamic cross correlation matrices, and other analysis were performed using the CPPTRAJ module ( ) of Amber.18 in conjunction with some in-house programs. At the salt concentration of 100 mM with the standard parameters, the MM/GBSA module, with the standard parameters, was used to estimate residue-residue interaction energies for all protein residues. A total of 6,000 configurations selected at each nanosecond from the five 1.2 \u03bcs MD trajectories for both the WT and W315L mutant dimer systems. All residues were used in the MMGBSA energy decomposition. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9371709, "text_md5": "dc437d4e0f88b53e38e807a8b20b19bd", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 192], "journal": [193, 217], "publication_year": [219, 223], "title": [234, 324], "keywords": [338, 465], "abstract": [478, 2351], "body": [2360, 46240]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 35914129, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2207459119", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9371709", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9371709"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9371709\">9371709</a>", "list_title": "PMC9371709  Structural insight and characterization of human Twinkle helicase in mitochondrial disease"}

Medicinal and surgical approaches are often ineffective, and the supply of autologous chondrocytes for tissue engineering is very limited. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow\u2010derived mesenchymal stem cells) have been suggested as an adequate cell source for cartilage reconstruction. However, the majority of studies employing BMSCs for cartilage tissue engineering have used BMSCs predifferentiated into cartilage prior to implantation. This strategy has failed to achieve formation of stable, hyaline\u2010like cartilage, resistant to hypertrophy in vivo. We hypothesized that in vitro predifferentiation of BMSCs is not necessary when cells are combined with an adequate scaffold that supports the formation of stable cartilage in vivo. In this study, na\u00efve (undifferentiated) human BMSCs were attached to dehydrothermally crosslinked stable fibrin microbeads (FMBs) without and with other scaffolds and implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Optimal formation of abundant, hypertrophy\u2010resistant, ectopic hyaline\u2010like cartilage was achieved when BMSCs were attached to FMBs covalently coated with hyaluronic acid. The cartilage that was formed was of human origin and was stable for at least 28 weeks in vivo.   2019;8:586\u2013592  \n \n\n# Body\n \n   Significance Statement   \nThe present report is the first to demonstrate formation of stable cartilage in vivo by human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Using fibrin microbeads coated with hyaluronic acid as a scaffold combined with na\u00efve BMSCs provides new possibilities for the restoration of damaged articular cartilage in regenerative medicine and for modeling of human cartilage diseases in vivo. \n \n\n## Introduction \n  \nMedicinal treatments for osteoarthritis are palliative, and surgical interventions have been less than optimal  . Populations of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow\u2010derived mesenchymal stem cells) contain skeletal stem cells, capable of differentiating into a spectrum of skeletal tissues, including cartilage (reviewed in  ). Consequently, BMSCs have been proposed for use in cartilage regeneration. However, implantation of BMSCs predifferentiated into a chondrogenic phenotype, a common practice in current cartilage tissue engineering, has not resulted in formation of stable, hyaline\u2010like cartilage, resistant to hypertrophic mineralization in vivo  . Proper handling of BMSCs ex vivo and choice of an appropriate scaffold appear to be critical. \n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that anchorage\u2010dependent cells bind tightly to fibrin matrix, inspiring the development of dense fibrin microbeads (FMBs)  ,  . In the current study, na\u00efve (undifferentiated) human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were attached to FMBs in combination with several secondary vehicles or to FMBs modified by covalent coating with hyaluronic acid (HyA\u2010FMBs) and implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. We report for the first time that stable hyaline\u2010like human cartilage can be formed in vivo by na\u00efve human BMSCs in combination with HyA\u2010FMBs. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nFor detailed experimental procedures, see Supporting Information Materials and Methods section. Human bone surgical waste was obtained in accordance with the National Institute of Health (NIH) regulations, governing the use of human subjects under Office of Human Subjects Research Protection (OHSRP) assurance NIDCR\u201000183. In vivo implantation was performed in accordance to an institutionally approved animal protocol and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A semiquantitative scoring system (range 0\u20134) as well as histomorphometry using Adobe Photoshop CS6 were used to evaluate cartilage and bone formation. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn preliminary experiments, hBMSCs attached to FMBs formed small amounts of cartilage in beige (bg)/nude mice (Supporting Information Fig.  ). To improve the cartilage formation, FMBs were combined with several secondary scaffolds (Fig.  A) or precultivated with hBMSCs and other vehicles in vitro. These combinations failed to increase cartilage formation (Supporting Information Figs.  ,  A,  B). Furthermore, based on inconsistent results using noncongenic bg/nude mice, two strains of congenic, highly immunocompromised mice were used in subsequent experiments. \n  \nCartilage formation in 19\u2010week\u2010old constructs of na\u00efve human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) with FMBs, without and with covalently bound HyA\u2010FMBs in NSG mice.   (A):   Study design. Scheme of subcutaneous placement of na\u00efve hBMSCs with FMBs, without and with secondary carriers, into immunocompromised mice.   (B):   Details for the experiment. All constructs were recovered. More mature cartilage was formed by hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMBs than by hBMSCs/FMBs (  p   =\u2009.0159). The bone and immature cartilage were also formed in both types of constructs, but with no statistical difference between the two types of constructs. Macroscopic views of cartilage formed   (C)   by hBMSC/FMB constructs and   (D)   by hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMB constructs.   (E):   Staining of hBMSC/FMB constructs with H&E revealed strong basophilic staining of the extracellular matrix in areas with cartilage morphology. The bone, with some hematopoiesis\u2010supporting foci, and fibrous tissue were found at the periphery of the constructs   (E, G)  . Cartilage\u2010like areas in hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMB constructs were   (F)   intensely basophilic in H&E\u2010stained sections and   (H)   strongly metachromatic in TB\u2010stained sections. Cartilaginous areas were more extensive in hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMBs construct   (F, H)  . Residual FMBs were more abundant in hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMB than in hBMSC/FMB constructs (  p   =\u2009.0079)   (E\u2013H)  . Green scale bars\u2009= 5 mm; black scale bars\u2009=\u2009200 \u03bcm.

At 19 weeks, hBMSC/FMB constructs were small and grayish\u2010pinkish (Fig.  C); minimal cartilage formation was observed in three of five constructs (Fig.  B, 1E, 1G). hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMB constructs were large, white, glossy (Fig.  D), and hard. Cartilage was found in all five constructs at a statistically higher amount compared with hBMSC/FMB constructs (scores: 3.0 \u00b1 0.7 vs. 1.2 \u00b1 1.1,   p   =\u2009.0317; areas of mature cartilage: 38.5%\u2009\u00b1 6.7% vs. 9.4%\u2009\u00b1 4.2%,   p   =\u2009.0159). Vast fields of cartilage contained chondrocytes in lacunae surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM) staining strongly basophilic with H&E (Fig.  F) and intensely metachromatic with toluidine blue (Fig.  H). In all constructs, sizable bone trabeculae were located at the periphery (Fig.  E, 1F), surrounding areas of hematopoiesis (Fig.  E, 1G), but not at statistically different levels between constructs (  p   =\u2009.2222). By 19\u2009weeks, nonresorbed HyA\u2010FMBs were more abundant than FMBs (  p   =\u2009.0079). \n\nCartilage formation in hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMB constructs was evaluated at 8, 16, or 28\u2009weeks in NSG and Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Hairless Congenic (SHC) mice (Fig.  A). At 8 weeks, NSG constructs revealed good cartilage (score 2; areas of mature cartilage, 18.8% and 20.0%; Fig.  A\u20132C) and little bone; SHC constructs demonstrated minimal mature cartilage (score 1; areas 1.9% and 5.9%) and no bone (Fig.  A, 2D). NSG constructs displayed limited positive staining for type X collagen (Fig.  F, 2G). In positive areas, some cells resembled hypertrophic chondrocytes (increased size, pyknotic nuclei, and fragmented cytoplasm; not shown). \n  \nCartilage formation in 8\u2010week\u2010old transplants of na\u00efve human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs)/HyA\u2010FMBs and transplants of empty FMBs and HyA\u2010FMBs.   (A):   Data collected using mice NSG, red box, and SHC, green box. All constructs containing na\u00efve hBMSCs were recovered at all time points. At 8 weeks, substantial cartilage (scores 2, 2; mature cartilage: 18.8% and 20.0% of total transplant areas) and some bone (3.5% and 0.6%) were formed in hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMBs in NSG mice and minimal cartilage (scores 1, 1; mature cartilage: 1.9% and 5.9%) but no bone in SHC mice.   (B):   In NSG mice, large fields of basophilic staining were noted that stained intensely with TB   (C)  .   (D):   Cartilage formed in SHC was slightly less mature than in NSG mice. Empty (without cells) FMBs were not found at 8 or 16\u2009weeks, and empty HyA\u2010FMBs were only found at 8 weeks (blue box) and consisted of large, unresorbed particles (79.2% of the transplant area) surrounded with a loose fibrous tissue, with no signs of cartilage formation   (E)  .   (F):   Small cartilaginous areas stained positively for type X collagen. A nonimmune immunoglobulin of the same isotype elicited no staining   (G)  . Black scale bars\u2009=\u2009100 \u03bcm; white scale bar\u2009=\u200950 \u03bcm.

ECM surrounding chondrocytes demonstrated moderate to strong staining for type II collagen (Fig.  E, 3G) but no immunoreactivity for type X collagen (Fig.  F). In SHC constructs, less mature cartilage (score 2; 15.9%) was formed (Fig.  A, 3D). \n  \nCartilage formation in 16\u2010week\u2010old transplants of na\u00efve human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs)/HyA\u2010FMBs.   (A):   Data collected using NSG mice, red box, and SHC mice, green box. At 16 weeks, extensive cartilage (score 3, 40.8% of mature cartilage) and some bone (1.1%) were formed using hBMSC/HyA\u2010FMBs in NSG mouse; less cartilage (score 2, 15.9% of mature cartilage) was formed in SHC mouse. Large fields of basophilic staining were noted   (B)  , that stained intensely with TB   (C)  , with some fibrous tissue; cartilage formed in SHC mouse was slightly less mature than in NSG   (D)  . Cartilaginous areas stained positively fort type II collagen   (E)  , but not for type X collagen   (F)  . A nonimmune immunoglobulin of the same isotype as both antibodies elicited no staining   (G)  . Scale bars\u2009=\u2009200 \u03bcm. Abbreviations: c, cartilage; f, residual fibrin microbeads; FMBs, fibrin microbeads; ft, fibrous tissue; HyA, hyaluronic acid; ic, immature cartilage; TB, toluidine blue; anti\u2010COL II, immunostaining with an antibody against type II collagen; anti\u2010COL X, immunostaining with an antibody against type X collagen; Non\u2010immune control, immunostaining with a nonimmune immunoglobulin. \n  \nAt 28 weeks, both NSG and SHC constructs preserved their white, glossy, pearl\u2010like appearance (insets, Fig.  B, 4C) and rigid consistency. Mature cartilage was the most prevalent tissue in the sections (score 4; areas 65.6% and 74.3%, respectively; Fig.  A\u2013 E). Narrow strips of fibrous tissue and thin, isolated bone trabeculae were observed at the periphery (insets, Fig.  D, 4E). The ECM displayed moderate to strong staining for type II collagen (Fig.  F). Staining for type X collagen was negative throughout the entire constructs (Fig.  G). Although the new bone stained positive for type I collagen, cartilage was negative (Fig.  H) and displayed moderate staining for Lubricin (Fig.  I). The lack of vascularization in the new cartilage was emphasized by negative staining for von Willebrand factor (Supporting Information Fig.  A,  B). Residual HyA\u2010FMBs persisted in both types of constructs; at all time points, more nonresorbed HyA\u2010FMBs remained in SHC than in NSG mice (Fig.  A\u2013 E). Thus, stable, abundant, hyaline\u2010like cartilage persisted, or expanded, up to the latest time point of 28 weeks (Fig.  A). \n  \nCartilage formation in 28\u2010week\u2010old transplants of na\u00efve human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs)/HyA\u2010FMBs.   (A):   Data collected using NSG mice, red box, and SHC mice, green box.   (B, C):   The white, glossy appearance of the transplants persisted (insets), and vast fields of cartilage were formed in both NSG and SHC constructs.   (D, E):   The cartilage matrix stained intensely purple with TB; small islands of bone were noted on the periphery of constructs in both strains of mice (insets). (  F):   Cartilage matrix stained intensely positive for type II collagen in NSG transplant.   (G):   No staining for type X collagen was noted in SHC transplant.   (H):   Bone matrix stained positive for type I collagen, whereas cartilage matrix stained negative in an NSG transplant.   (I):   Cartilage matrix stained positive for Lubricin in an NSG transplant. The non\u2010immune control for all four of these antibodies is shown in Figure  C. Green scale bars\u2009= 5 mm; black and white scale bars\u2009=\u2009100 \u03bcm.

Anti\u2010Lubricin, immunostaining with antibody against Lubricin. \n  \nThe human origin of the cartilage was demonstrated by positive staining with an antibody specific for human mitochondria (Supporting Information Fig.  D,  E) in NSG 28\u2010week constructs. FMB constructs without BMSCs (empty) were not found at 8 or 16\u2009weeks, whereas empty HyA\u2010FMBs were found at 8 weeks only (Fig.  A), consisting of large, nonresorbed HyA\u2010FMB particles (occupying 79.2% of the areas of the sections), sparsely populated with fibrous tissue without cartilage (Fig.  A, 2E). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPellet cultures, the current gold standard for hBMSC chondrogenic differentiation  , undergo endochondral bone formation in vitro  . Consequently, it is not surprising that preformed cartilage constructs do not generate cartilage in vivo and instead undergo either hypertrophy and mineralization   or remodeling into a bone/marrow organ  . No protocols currently exist for generation of functional hyaline cartilage by hBMSCs in vivo  . We hypothesized that na\u00efve hBMSCs could form hyaline cartilage in vivo if a scaffold promoting chondrogenic differentiation is identified. Fibrin\u2010based matrices and fibrin/HyA hydrogels supported early chondrogenesis in vitro but degraded too quickly in vivo  . More stable dense FMBs that retained cell binding properties of fibrin were then developed for cell implantation  . \n\nIn our study, HyA\u2010FMBs with na\u00efve hBMSC generated stable, glossy\u2010white, resilient tissues in vivo, which were histologically similar to, and demonstrated the important markers of, hyaline cartilage\u2014type II collagen and Lubricin  \u2014but lacking both type I collagen and vascularization. At the earliest time point (8 weeks), small regions of newly formed cartilage demonstrated hypertrophic chondrocyte morphology and stained positively for type X collagen. Importantly, these type X collagen\u2010positive areas totally disappeared by 28\u2009weeks, suggesting that the vast majority of the cartilage formed had no tendency to become hypertrophic or to undergo endochondral ossification. Immunostaining for human mitochondria verified the human origin of the chondrocytes, even at 28\u2009weeks (\u223c0.5 years). The mature\u2010looking human cartilage not only persisted but also significantly expanded, occupying almost the entire areas of the constructs. \n\nThe subcutaneous location is considered to be nonpermissive for development of hyaline cartilage  . However, fresh or low passage human articular chondrocytes do form stable cartilage even in the hostile subcutaneous environment (e.g.,  ), the very same cells that have been most successful clinically. It is likely that in more permissive orthotopic conditions, cells that have passed rigorous subcutaneous tests will have higher chances of forming permanent, articular\u2010type cartilage. Indeed, human induced pluripotent stem cell\u2010derived chondrocytes formed better cartilage in joint defects than subcutaneously  . \n\nOf note, constructs supporting stable cartilage formation in vivo were formed following a simple 90\u2010minute incubation of HyA\u2010FMBs with na\u00efve BMSCs. Neither creation of complex, tissue\u2010like constructs in vitro nor the use of biphasic or triphasic scaffolds improved cartilage formation by hBMSCs in vivo (see Supporting Information Results section). However, the timing and amount of cartilage (and peripheral bone) formed by hBMSC using HyA\u2010FMBs and other scaffolds differed among bg/nude, NSG, and SHC mice. Additional studies are needed to identify critical elements in both the recipient and donor that promote cartilage versus bone formation. It will be necessary to determine if hBMSCs from older, clinically relevant individuals will generate abundant cartilage with HyA\u2010FMBs, as pediatric BMSCs do. Interestingly, in our previous studies, comparable amounts of bone were formed in vivo by hBMSCs from pediatric and elderly donors (S. A. Kuznetsov and P. G. Robey, unpublished observations). Preclinical studies on repair of intra\u2010articular defects by hBMSCs in immunocompromised mice and rats are underway, moving toward the development of a technique for human cartilage defect restoration. Lastly, this in vivo model system can be developed to study pathological mechanisms of human genetic and acquired diseases of cartilage. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe have demonstrated that chondrogenic pre\u2010differentiation of BMSCs is not required in order to form cartilage in vivo. Na\u00efve, undifferentiated human BMSCs, combined with HyA\u2010FMBs and implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice, generated abundant, hypertrophy\u2010resistant, hyaline\u2010like cartilage of human origin, stable for at least 28 weeks in vivo. This approach is promising for restoration of joint cartilage defects in humans. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nS.A.K., R.G.: conception/design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, final approval of manuscript; A.H.\u2010L., N.C., L.F.d.C.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript; P.G.R.: conception/design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, statistical analysis, final approval of manuscript. \n\n\n## Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest \n  \nThe authors indicated no potential conflicts of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6525579, "text_md5": "2f1f8dbf6a4223fd85b0caf9f1308e8a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 132], "journal": [133, 154], "publication_year": [156, 160], "title": [171, 289], "keywords": [303, 388], "abstract": [401, 1757], "body": [1766, 19297]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 30767420, "doi": "10.1002/sctm.18-0129", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6525579", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6525579"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6525579\">6525579</a>", "list_title": "PMC6525579  In Vivo Formation of Stable Hyaline Cartilage by Na\u00efve Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells with Modified Fibrin Microbeads"}

Epidemiological studies have shown that nicotine consumption decreases PD prevalence through neuroprotective mechanisms activation associated with the overstimulation of signaling pathways (SP) such as PI3K/AKT through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (  e.g   \u03b17 nAChRs) and over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2.

As a complex multifactorial disease, PD is caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins, genetic predisposition, mitochondrial dystrophies, epigenetic imbalance and environmental factors that increase the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the   substantia nigra   of the brain [  \u2013  ]. Traditional approaches of dopaminergic replacement, such as levodopa, carbidopa, and dopamine agonists (apomorphine, amantadine, cabergoline, pergolide, etc) restore direct or indirect dopaminergic supply, modulate dopaminergic neuron activity and stimulate postsynaptic receptors [ ,  ]. However, classical therapeutics are directed towards treating PD symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and systemic complications) in exchange for reducing disease progression coupled with a lack of long-term efficacy [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nEpidemiological studies demonstrated an inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD risk [  \u2013  ]. Pre-clinical studies using   in vivo   and   in vitro   models showed that nAChR agonists protect nigrostriatal and other neuronal cell populations against cytotoxic damage, suggesting a neuroprotective activity [  \u2013  ]. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels capable to respond to several ligands such as acetylcholine and nicotine [ ]. Classified between neuronal and muscle subtype receptors, only one pentameric subtype of nAChR (2  \u03b1  1,   \u03b2  1,   \u03b3  /  \u03b5  ,   \u03b4  ) has been reported for muscles compared with the 12 subtypes in the neural system (  \u03b1  2\u201310,   \u03b2  2\u20134). Neuroprotective activity of nicotine and nicotine agonists has been linked to the activation of \u03b17-nAChRs [ ,  ]. Highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons, \u03b17-nAChRs activation increases calcium flow and activates downstream SP such as ERK/MAPK, JAK2/STAT3, calmodulin and PI3K/AKT. SP activation has been related with neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and decreased apoptosis due to the overexpression of cell survival proteins such as Bcl-x, CREB and Bcl-2 [  \u2013  ]. In parallel, tumor suppressor p53 directly regulates cell survival by modulating Bax:Bcl-2 expression, influencing the apoptotic fate of a cell in response to stress [ ]. Bcl-2 has been suggested as a candidate for the nicotine-mediated neuroprotection activity in neurons. For example, nicotine induces the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 through either protein kinase C (PKC) and the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 or through PI3K-induced phosphorylation of AKT causing the inhibition of apoptosis in neuronal cultures [ ,  ,  ,   \u2013  ]. Additionally, overexpression of Bcl-2 Prevents neuronal death in   Mus musculus   models and Bcl-2 inhibition results in viability loss in dopaminergic cells through the induction of caspase-3 [ ,  ]. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nIn this sense, nAChRs agonists can reduce secondary effects of classical therapies such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia, increased dopamine release and improve cytochrome P450 activity [ ,  ]. Nicotine usage as a pharmacological agent is limited considering toxicity and addiction [ ]. Nicotine analogs retaining neuroprotective activity, but reducing toxicity and addiction offer an excellent pharmacological alternative in PD [  \u2013  ]. We have previously the antioxidant potential of two nicotine analogs against rotenone-induced ROS generation in a PD   in vitro   model founding that 10 \u03bcM of (E)-Nicotinaldehyde O-Cinnamyloxime was able to reduce superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells treated with rotenone for 24h [ ]. Consistently, other studies showed that nicotine analogs decrease superoxide anion generation and oxidative stress in rodents   Mus musculus   and   Rattus rattus  , as well as primates   Macaca fascicularis   and   Saimiri sciureus   through the activation of \u03b17 nAChRs and PI3K/AKT [ ,   \u2013  ]. Computational methods have been used to infer the activity of candidate molecules but, due to the intrinsic PD complexity, is important to improve drug scanning efficiency by integrating structural and systemic data [  \u2013  ]. The development of holistic computational methodologies for SP and their modulatory mechanisms can lead to the discovery of new pharmacological agents [ ,  ]. In this aspect, the use of Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been previously used in a simplified model of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of cancer [ ]. Nevertheless, the absence of integrative modeling in PD has led to a decrease in drug discovery efficiency. In the present study, we predicted the effect of 8 novel nicotine analogs as possible neuroprotective agents acting on PI3K/AKT by integrating structural bioinformatic methods, SP manual reconstruction and ANN ( ). \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Geometry and Structure Analysis \n  \nStructures of (3R,5S)-1, methyl-5-(piridine-3-yl) pirrolidine-3-ol (A1), 3-(1,3-dimethyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A2), 3-(3-methyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pira-zole-5-yl) piridine (A3), 3(((2S-4R)-1,4-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl)) (A4), 3-((2S,4R)-4-(fluoromethyl)-1-methylpirrolidine-2-il)piridine (A5), 3-((2S,4R)-4-methoxi-1-methylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A6), 3-((2S,3S)-1,3-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A7) and 5-methyl-3-(piridine-3-yl)-4,5-dihidroisoxazole (A8) were used for subsequent methods ( ). The neutral molecules optimized at the B3LYP/631G level and conformationally analyzed at the PM6 level showed rotations around C1-C1\u00b4bonds and bonds between radical atoms and rings. The minimum energy geometry found was used as input for subsequent analysis and the corresponding energy values (kJ/mol) for the local minimum geometrical conformers were reported in  . Geometrical rotations around the bonds of the rings and the radicals were categorized as true minima of the potential energy of the surface based on the absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies. \n\n\n### Nicotine Analogs Docking and \u03b17-nAChR Binding Interaction \n  \n\u03b17 nAChR has 5 active pockets located at each subunit interactions of the protein complex. Considering that the homopentamer has 5 identical active pockets, we modeled the interaction within one of the pockets considering all the 5 pockets in the homopentamer subunits interaction region are identical. AChBP ligand-binding structure possesses conserved domain residues forming a narrow hydrophobic pocket including A (Tyr91), B (Trp145), C (Tyr184 and Tyr191), D (Trp53), E (Leu106, Gln114 and Leu116). Whereby A, B, and C are present in a different AChBP ligand-binding subunit than D and E ( ). Following the structural analysis, the nicotine analogs were set to interact with the active pocket within the interaction of the \u03b17 nAChR homo-subunits. Nicotine structure resulted in a geometrical docked conformation in which the pyrrole ring is oriented towards the C loop favoring Van der Waals interactions with amino acids TYR91, TRP145, and TYR184 of the chain A, in addition to LEU106 and TRP53 of the chain B ( ). \n\nDocking models were performed with the top ligand conformations and the energy interaction values are presented in  . Evaluated nicotine analogs, except for A1 and A3, have minor binding energy compared with nicotine ( ). Energetically minimized protein structures interacting with nicotine and analogs were used to calculate Root-Mean-Square Deviation of atomic positions (RMSD) in a comparative manner against the unbonded receptor and \u03b17 nAChR docked with nicotine ( ). Such an unbonded model was set as the minimized structure of \u03b17 nAChR without ligand on the active side. \n\n\n### Clustering of Similarity \n  \nTwo manually curated groups of compounds with known \u03b17 nAChR agonistic and antagonistic activities were used as input for the cluster. The first group consisted of \u03b17 nAChR agonists SAK3 [ ], Nicotine, Acetylcholine, TC-1698 [ ], PNU-282987 [ ], DMXB [ ], and ABT-107 [ ]. The second group was composed of receptor \u03b17 antagonists and included methyllycaconitine [ ], mecamylamine [ ], neostigmine [ ], anisodamine [ ] and bupropion [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, these are all the compounds reported with agonistic neuroprotective activity and agonistic activity over \u03b17 nAChR. In this sense, we set a positive response of PI3K/AKT for the first group and we hypothesized a null activation of PI3K/AKT SP or repression by other molecular mechanisms, and therefore no neuroprotective activity [ ]. The same procedure previously mentioned was applied to obtain the optimized conformers for each group and all were categorized considering general descriptors of physicochemical properties [ ,  ]. Surprisingly, the dendrogram of similarity was found to be related to the variables and the neuroprotective activity but with inconclusive scores for similarity ( ). Nevertheless, cluster values of similarity for PaDEL-Descriptors structural, physical and chemical values were used to enrich the known experimental data of the ligands. \n\n\n### Signaling Pathway Reconstruction and Predictive Model of Interaction-Response \n  \nThe reconstructed model of PI3K/AKT SP presented both activation or inhibition of Bcl-2, as it occurs within the cell [ ]. The network is composed of 28 nodes (proteins) that represent relevant components of the pathway (\u03b17 nAChR, PI3K, AKT, CREB, etc), 2 final states (activation/inhibition) and 43 interactions between the nodes ( ). The network was constructed using nodes with biological relevance associated with PI3K/AKT and P53 proliferative regulatory activity. \n\nWith previously mentioned clustering and PaDEL-Descriptors data, 1848 variables were obtained characterizing physico-chemical and pharmacological properties for each one of the molecules, both agonist/antagonist and nicotine analogs. Reducing the number of variables for subsequent analysis, principal component analysis (PCA,  ) and K-mean decomposition ( ) were used maintaining data variance explanation. First PCA three dimensions explained 98.9% of variance across the original dataset ( ) while the K-mean showed a variance explanation of 57.1% for two-dimensions and the corresponding coordinate values ( ). \n\nBased on the PI3K/AKT architecture the resulting MCMC topology representing probabilities of transition within the network ( ). In this case, the resulting Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model was able to quantify the transitions between the directed network resulting in a model capable to determine the ANN architecture. The most effective number of hidden layers of the ANN was determined by iterative topology generation and convergence was reached at 100.000 iterations. Such an approach resulted in a multi-perceptron ANN with 4 hidden layers with 5, 1, 4 and 5 nodes respectively ( ). In general, the resulting topology lack a canonical hidden layer architectures considering these models tend to reduce the number of nodes per layer across the model [ ]. \n\nTraining datasets from the PCA and K-mean were evaluated for each of the ANN learning with 1000 iterations with randomized series and reported values of misclassification ( ). Backpropagation with weight tracking coupled with PCA model was capable of generating consistent results. In this sense, the consistency of resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking and PCA was 100% but resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking and K-mean showed 98%. These results suggest that both methods were able to predict the binomial output for the training and testing datasets. Nevertheless, throughout the iterations not all the predictions were identical in resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking and K-mean. \n\nThe resulting best ANN model implementing resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking is based on the evolving adaptation rule with a learning process based on error function [ ].\n \nand\n \n\nBriefly, for the adaptation rule each update-value   changes depending on the sign for each partial derivative of   \u00f9   at point   t  . If the values are too big then the algorithm skips a local minimum and the function decreases by  . Once   adapts,   changes according to   results  . Positive values of the derivative mean an error increase; therefore, the function is decreased by its  . Finally, the exception presented deals with changes in partial derivative sign   [ ]. In that case, the step was too large and missing the minimum, so the previous   is reverted. Finally, with the best trained structure method with PCA and Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking and the MCMC derived ANN multi-perceptron architecture it was possible to predict the neuroprotective potential of the nicotine analogs. This model predicted A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8 as potential neuroprotective agents. In this aspect, our model predicted that 7 out of 8 analogs had putative neuroprotective activity due to the association of the binomial output of the ANN with the activation of Bcl-2. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Conformer Geometry and Ligand-Receptor Interaction \n  \nEven though research efforts have been done regarding the pharmaceutical potential of nicotine analogs, little assessment of some critical aspects of their conformational variability has been studied [ ,  ]. Recently, the crystallographic structure of the extracellular domain of the nicotinic receptor \u03b17 in complex with epibatidine was reported [ ]. Although interactions described for the complex agree with our results, it was found that THR146, CYS187, and CYS186 could also be involved in the protein complex due to molecular proximity. Docking with analog A5 had a high-affinity score (\u22124.7) with respect to nicotine (\u22125.5) ( ). A5 affinity can be attributed to the geometrical conformation establishing hydrogen bonds and radicals orientation towards TRP145, similar to epibatidine. The high affinity of epibatidine has been related to large inter-nitrogen distance previously reported as 4.6 \u01fa [ ]. \n\nConsidering H-bond acceptors and donors number, analogs and nicotine had similar values. Specifically, A2, A3, A4 and A7 have two H-bond donors in comparison with three for A1, A5, A6 and A8. In terms of routable bonds, A5 and A6 differ from the single bond in nicotine considering the presence of radicals across the pyrrole ring ( ). Fluorine radical of A5 and the methyl group attached to the oxygen radical of A6 are rotation-capable bonds relative to the ring plane. Distinct similarity values in the clustering analysis for analogs A3 and A8 ( ) are not reflected in the values of energy affinity or interacting residues. Interestingly, A3 and A8 are the only analogs with a single methyl group addition to the pyrrolidine ring. In this sense, the group generated between A3 and A8 can be associated with the presence of the methyl group and the double bond with nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring. Nevertheless, clustering was capable of generating patterns based on atom pair descriptors and molecular fingerprints, the model is inefficient to replicate the docking data. All analogs clustered with nicotine and TC-1698 with a node value of 0.4 in the dendrogram, but A3 and A8 showed significant similarity with TC-1698, suggesting agonistic and neuroprotective activity. Interestingly, A3 and A8 also have a null net charge of interaction with the protein ( ). Nevertheless, further   in vitro   and   in vivo   experiments are necessary to assess the neuroprotective capacity of the tested molecules and   in silico   modeling must be performed to establish a correlation between structural signatures and biological activity. \n\nBesides affinity energy, the type and amount of interactions are crucial to determine the role of the docking in the protein function [ ]. In this case, nicotine interacts with TRP53, Tyr91, Leu116, Trp145, Tyr184, Cys186, Cys187 and Tyr191 through hydrophobic interactions and without hydrogen bonds ( ). Compared with nicotinic receptor \u03b17 in complex with epibatidine interaction, only residues Leu106 and Gln114 were absent in the interaction [ ]. Compared with the analogs, hydrophobic interactions with Leu106 were present in the analogs A1, A5, A6, and A8, but no hydrophobic interactions or hydrogen bonds were found with Gln114 ( ). The rest of the residues interacting with nicotine were found interacting at least once with any analog in similar geometrical orientations. Interestingly, none of the analogs presented the same interactions as nicotine, but the energy changes were not higher than 0.4 kJ/mol, except for A5 with 0.8 kJ/mol. Such values of A5 could be attributed to the highly electronegative fluorine radical interacting with Thr146. An increase in Affinity energy could be associated with the presence of hydroxyl radical in the polar sidechain. Moreover, fluorine has been associated with secondary effects in humans and, if consumed in higher doses, has been reported to be toxic, thus suggesting that A5 is not a suitable neuroprotective agent [ ,  ]. However, further studies must be performed in order to identify the role of specific residues in the activity of the complex and specific analog modifications effect over protein interactions. \n\nAdditionally, taking into account the comparison of RMSD values, after depuration of 25% of the misplaced atoms, unbonded protein and interacting complex with nicotine were lower than 0,1. Nicotine and analogs with the unbonded protein, RMSD validated our docking result ( ). RMSD for A2, A3 and A8 are higher than the rest of analogs when compared with the bounded complex with nicotine meaning that the geometrical modifications of the protein are higher. In this sense, A3 and A8 have the potential of interacting with the receptor similar to other neuroprotective compounds but changing the receptor response when compared with nicotine. The similar biological activity could be deduced also by considering the residues interacting, A3 and A8 as well as A6 and A7 present hydrogen bond interactions similar to nicotine ( ). With the structural and geometrical analysis is possible to conclude that all analogs except for A5 have neuroprotective potential and that A3 and A8 have an interesting behavior that must be addressed with   in vitro   and   in vivo   experiments. For A5, we present evidence of difference in energy affinity, interacting residues and fluoride radicals lead to the potential toxicity of A5. \n\nNevertheless, inconclusive relations between ligand structure, complex bonding and neuroprotective response occurred within the clustering. Even though consistent aggrupation occurred for all the neuroprotective compounds, antagonists generate a disperse distribution in the graph. The clustering FOF method was able to discriminate between biological effects but only strong aggrupation occurred only for neuroprotection positive molecules ( ). Acetylcholine was discarded considering divergence and ubiquitous neurotransmitter distribution coupled with no associated neuroprotective function [ ]. Worth noticing, the potential toxicity of the other analogs should be addressed by experimental methods considering no information is available in cell culture or animal models neither   in silico   testing \n\n\n### Neuroprotective Prediction Modeling \n  \nOnly a few studies have employed ANN in the study of signaling pathways [ ,  ]. For instance, a 3-layered multi-perceptron with backpropagation learning and sigmoid activation function was implemented across 96 genes to identify biomarkers in children sarcomas [ ]. Moreover, a simplified neural network comprising two microenvironmental input nodes (growth factor and death signal), and two phenotype output nodes (pro-growth and pro-death) was used to integrate environmental and molecular characteristics of cancer progression [ ]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines structural data, docking simulations, MCMC and ANN evaluating the modulation of PI3K/AKT allowing the prediction of neuroprotective new compounds. By including a higher set of variables, analogs cluster near to nicotine for both PCA and K-mean decomposition analysis (  &  ). Nevertheless, the absence of strong groups in the PCA and K-mean analysis showed that synthetic data was not conclusive to predict the biological activity by themselves. With this in mind, the ANN model was essential to discriminate between the groups and underline the fundamental properties of the analogs based on the SP structure, using both PCA and K-mean synthetic values \n\nSP are dynamic systems in which crosstalk with neighbor paths is essential to modulate signal intensity [ ]. P53 negative feedback increased the robustness of the model by modifying Bcl-2 binomial output and information flow across the model supporting network regulation ( ). Additionally, ionotropic channels, such as \u03b17-nAChR acting over PI3K/AKT lead to an activation without explicitly acknowledging the presence of JAK [ ]. MCMC PI3K/AKT-derived model considered a matrix of transition representing network structure and probabilities of transition across PI3K/AKT leading to robust computational inferences [ ]. By applying MCMC to the network topology it was possible to transfer the biological structure of the network to a quantitative model capable to modulate ANN architecture. The resulting non-canonical multi perceptron structure resulted as biological-based discrimination of ANN architectures through iterations using the MCMC matrix. Similar approaches such as the   drop-out   technique allow to drop units from the neural network during training hence preventing an excessive coadaptation and overfitting of the network [ ]. Iterative processes converged at the minimal topology with a significant predictive capacity of the ANN model reducing layer and nodes number [ ]. The hidden layers were locked according to the MCMC product ( ), ensuring that the subsequent topology represented the biological information contained in the SP. In this aspect, the synthetic iterative randomized data sets integrated with dimensional minimization and ANN, allowed the determination of the best predictive method reducing error and ensuring consistent predictions during training. \n\nPCA and K-mean dimensional reduction showed to be an effective way to effectively decrease sample variability to a low number of synthetic values [ ]. By reducing the number of variables from 1848 variables to a small non-autocorrelated dataset, PCA and K-mean reproduced clustering results. This approach was implemented in order to optimize the performance of the strategy and reduce overfitting of the trained ANN model. Through variable reduction, we increased the sensibility and reliability of the model to predict the binomial neuroprotective signal output. This data was used as training/testing for the ANN model evaluating some of the developed learning algorithms [ ]. Identical split differences in misclassification for smallest absolute derivative, backpropagation and smallest learning rate with PCA and K-mean, and resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with K-mean were identified ( ). Improvement was found for 25% misclassification for both resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA and resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking with K-mean. With this last method inconsistency in the predicting output was found meaning the output change through 2% of the iterations. Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA resulted as the best combination for neuroprotection prediction, considering 100% of the predictions were consistent along with the iterations. The resulting model was based on the implementation of an adaptation rule with a learning based on error values [ ]. By predicting the binomial neuroprotective output of the ANN with synthetic PCA data from structural conformational, docking analysis and physicochemical featuring, made possible to determine that A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8 have potential neuroprotective agents. In general, the results are consistent with the experimental data available for some of the compounds [ ,   \u2013  ]. \n\nEven though this model considers the main aspects of SP response to external stimuli, some key considerations are necessary. Structurally, the number of reference compounds used was low, making it necessary to improve \u03b17-nAChR agonist/antagonist data through identification and screening. Data restriction can lead to predicting bias of the model, overfitting or fixed prediction. In this matter, we recommend implementing both agonist and antagonist   in silico   and experimental screening to increase the training dataset. Although, the inclusion of synthetic molecules, such as SAK3, PNU-282987 and allosteric modulators allowed to improve predictions considering previously reported induction of neuroprotection through the modulation of PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 [ ]. Furthermore, the model can be used to address the secondary effects of nicotine analogs by increasing the dataset with addiction/reward molecules like nicotine and methyllycaconitine [ ]. \n\nCorrecting inner functions for noisy data needs to be coupled with further testing, essential to determine the true potential of nicotine analogs and antagonists for PD therapy. In this regard, we propose a mathematical   in silico   model that has to be used integrated with   in vitro   and   in vivo   data, either on dopaminergic neuronal cell lines, cerebral organoids or animal models. Database cluster enrichment with experimental data allows to increase the reference compounds and therefore reducing possible prediction bias and overfitting. Even so, the model strategy was in accordance with previously published experimental data [ ,   \u2013  ] proving to be robust enough as a testing method for further research. Worth noticing, SP are dynamic systems, therefore we suggest that continuous parameters need to be addressed to consider essential intermediate states [ ]. Finally, this strategy opens the door to improve neuroprotection prediction in the future by integrating protein dynamics, partial differential equations and other machine learning approaches. These type of approaches are necessary to improve drug scanning efficiency in PD and any other disease founded upon SP. \n\n\n### Conformational Analysis and Protein Structure Preparation \n  \n8 novel nicotine analogs ( ) were used in the present study: (3R,5S)-1, methyl-5-(piridine-3-yl) pirrolidine-3-ol (A1), 3-(1,3-dimethyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A2), 3-(3-methyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A3), 3(((2S-4R)-1,4-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl)) (A4), 3-((2S,4R)-4-(fluoromethyl)-1-methylpirrolidine-2-il)piridine (A5), 3-((2S,4R)-4-methoxi-1-methylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A6), 3-((2S,3S)-1,3-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A7) and 5-methyl-3-(piridine-3-yl)-4,5-dihidroisoxazole (A8). Molecular structures were sketched on Avogadro using MMFF94s forcefield, correcting atom type and chirality [ ]. Calculations were carried out with Gaussian 16 [ ], using B3LYP level of theory and cc-PVDZ basis set. In order to find the minimum energetic conformation, the structures were optimized at the DFT B3LYP/6\u201331G level. The conformational analysis was carried out on minimized rotating bonds between pyrrole, derivate rings, and pyridine rings, including the bonds of all the radicals of the pyrrole ring for each ligand. The maximum number of conformers for each molecule was set to 30, with the 10 lowest energy conformations used for the docking simulations. \n\nThe crystal structure of \u03b17-nAChR in complex with lobeline was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5AFJ) [ ]. AutoDockTools [ ] was used to assign polar hydrogens and add Gasteiger charges. The geometry of the receptor was optimized using the MM2 molecular mechanics force field. The neutral and ionized states of aliphatic amine and carboxylic acid groups of compounds to be docked were protonated and deprotonated separately. \n\n\n### Molecular Docking \n  \nTo determine the interaction between the studied molecules and the receptor, docking simulations were performed with AutoDock4 (version 4.2) [ ]. The active site of the pentameric structure of \u03b17-nAChR was defined as the interfaces between subunits that were within 12 \u00c5 from the geometric centroid of the ligand [ ]. Within the 3 domains of the protein (extracellular, intracellular and transmembrane), the pocket is located in the extracellular side of the receptor with residues from loops A-C of the principal subunit and loops D-E of the complementary subunit. Default settings for small molecule-protein docking were used throughout the simulations. \n\nDocked conformations were clustered according to the interacting energy combined with geometrical matching quality. The complexes with the best score were taken as the lead conformation for each compound. The correlation between key interactions obtained from the computational simulations and the interactions reported by the crystallographic structure of \u03b17-nAChR in complex with lobeline was further explored. To further analyze the differences between the interaction of the analogs and the receptor, we calculated the RMSD values between analogs, nicotine and the receptor. RMSD was calculated using 85% of the atoms resulted after 3 outlier rejection cycles. The energetically minimized docked structures of the \u03b17-nAChR receptor were made with Chimera [ ], using 10000 steepest descent steps, 0.001 \u01fa steepest descent steps size, 10 conjugate gradient steps, 0.001 \u01fa conjugate gradient steps size, update per 10 intervals, gasteiger method for charge and Amber ff14sb algorithms for residues. \n\n\n### Physicochemical Clustering and Dimensional Decomposition \n  \nTo determine the features for each molecule and their structural similarity, physicochemical property predictions, classification and clustering of structures were performed on ChemmineR, R package [ ]. Structural similarities between analogs were compared to a manually curated dataset of 7 agonists and 5 antagonists of \u03b17-nAChR with reported neuroprotective activity [  \u2013  ]. This method allowed us to increase the size of the available data, robustness and reproducibility. In the dataset, agonists of \u03b17-nAChR were associated with the induction of a neuroprotective pathway, either expressed through the induction of cell proliferation or apoptotic prevention. Antagonists were set to block either the proliferative activity by PI3K/AKT of the signaling pathway or the associated Ca  mobilization of the receptor [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nClustering analysis was based on molecular descriptors, such as molecular formula, molecular weight, atom frequency and functional groups. To determine the optimal cluster, a matrix of molecular descriptors for all molecules was used, categorizing the ligands according to the structural, physical and chemical variables. To increase the robustness of the clustering model, additional physicochemical data from   de-novo   featurization was included [ ]. To ensure a proper physicochemical featurization and increase the number of variables available for further analysis, data from   de-novo   characterization using PaDEL-Descriptors [ ] was also included. Dimensionality reduction of the dataset was done by principal component analysis (PCA) and k-mean decomposition. The mentioned approaches were used to identify the multiparametric data capable to describe the agonistic and antagonistic function and the relation between the activity and structure of the ligands in the dataset. \n\n\n### Signal Reconstruction \n  \nTo establish a reliable topology of the SP related with the neuroprotective capacity of nicotine, a manually reconstructed network for the PI3K/AKT SP was developed using information from KEGG [  \u2013  ] and PantherDB [ ]. To ensure the biological coherence of the network, our model was enriched with additional protein-protein interactions that are present in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR interactive pathway [ ]. Finally, this PI3K/AKT SP was integrated with a manually curated model of p53 to generate a negative feedback over Bcl-2. In this aspect, the model included 6 specific proteins (Myc, Bim, P53, Bax, Noxa, Puma) associated with the partial inhibition of the Bcl-2, which emulates the SP biological behavior [ ]. \n\n\n### Activity Prediction and Interaction-Response Model \n  \nIn order to elucidate the quantitative relationship between \u03b17-nAChR receptor and the activation of Bcl-2, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model for the whole network was implemented. This model was based on the reconstructed PI3K/AKT SP network and was generated using the R package   MCMCpack   [ ]. A matrix of transitional stages predicting the most suitable path across the nodes was associated with the end stages of the MCMC that represented Bcl-2 expression as a binomial logical argument. The construction of the Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) was performed with the   NeuralNet   package in R [ ]. To determine the canonical architecture for the ANN we used an optimization algorithm using 100.000 iterations using the MCMC transition matrix as an input. A stable multi-perceptron structure was set to have a minimal number of hidden layers with the capacity of representing the MCMC transition matrix, as shown below: \n\nBriefly, a matrix   x   is used as input in the first layer of the multiperceptron. Each node of the hidden layer computes   f   to finally generate a binomial   y   output. \n\nThe dimensional reduction methods were used to train the ANN using the coordinates in the PCA and K-mean. One thousand randomized training datasets were selected and associated with the binomial activity of the ligand dataset. To optimize the predictive capability of the model using the training datasets, four ANN algorithms were compared: Backpropagation with a learning rate of 0.001, Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking, Resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking, smallest absolute derivative model and smallest learning rate. Additionally, for each possible combination of dimensional minimizations and ANN methods, the random data subsets used as training were iteratively generated, after excluding the testing values. To ensure the robustness of the prediction, values for misclassification error were obtained for each training and testing combination. In this aspect, the best model acquired was set to minimize the error to reduce the amount of false-positive predictions. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe present a novel computational strategy as a novel quantitative approach used to predict the potential neuroprotective activity of 7 nicotine analogs in the context of PD therapeutics (A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first machine learning neuroprotective computational strategy for ligand activity prediction over \u03b17-nAChR activating PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2. By conformational analysis, molecular docking, the use of PaDEL variables and geometrical optimization, we obtained robust evidence suggesting nicotine analogs activity compared with nicotine. \n\nThe model also showed the potential of ANN integrations with a dimensional reduction to avoid overfitting by autocorrelation. Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA showed to be the best combination for ANN training to validate the neuroprotective activity. Nevertheless, additional data is needed to ensure model robustness, decrease the error of misclassification and avoid fixing predictions. Nicotine analogs have promissory future as candidates for PD treatment if future improvements to these strategies are performed. Nevertheless, further studies must be performed to identify the potential of nicotine analogs as neuroprotective compounds and the application of these methods in neurodegenerative research. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8081347, "text_md5": "156bf452ddaa3db9a674c113b446c1fe", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 176], "publication_year": [178, 182], "title": [193, 297], "keywords": [311, 418], "abstract": [431, 2819], "body": [2828, 38747]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33927788, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081347", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8081347"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081347\">8081347</a>", "list_title": "PMC8081347  Machine Learning Neuroprotective Strategy Reveals a Unique Set of Parkinson Therapeutic Nicotine Analogs"}

Interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2R\u03b1) is expressed in the leukemic cells of smoldering/chronic ATL patients, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and spontaneous proliferation. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also plays a critical role in ATL cell survival and proliferation. We previously performed a high-throughput screen that demonstrated additive/synergistic activity of Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with AZD8055, an mTORC1/C2 inhibitor. However, effects of unintended JAK2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib limits it therapeutic potential for ATL patients, which lead us to evaluate a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Here, we demonstrated that Upadacitinib, a JAK-1 inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and the expression of p-STAT5. Combinations of Upadacitinib with either AZD8055 or Sapanisertib, mTORC1/C2 inhibitors, showed anti-proliferative effects against cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and synergistic effect with reducing tumor growth in NSG mice bearing IL-2 transgenic tumors. Importantly, the combination of these two agents inhibited   ex vivo   spontaneous proliferation of ATL cells from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. Combined targeting of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways represents a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a malignancy of regulatory T cells (Tregs), associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection that is curable only with an allogeneic stem cell transplantation  . ATL is classified into four clinical subtypes: acute, lymphoma, smoldering, and chronic subtypes  . Although various molecular pathophysiological characteristics of ATL have been explored, the efficacy of current treatments is still limited, particularly in relapsed and refractory disease  . The HTLV-1-encoded transactivating protein Tax, interacts with numerous cellular factors that promote survival and immortalization of HTLV-1-infected T-cells  . Our group demonstrated that Tax transactivates two autocrine pathways of IL-2/IL-2R\u03b1, IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 and one paracrine pathway of IL-9 [ ,  ,  ]. This activation led to the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT5 with the subsequent entry of phosphorylated STAT5 into the nucleus. Abnormal activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is also prevalent in other types of T-cell malignancies  . Independently, JAK activation or STAT mutations are not adequate to initiate leukemic cell proliferation, but rather required the complete cascade of JAK activation and STAT phosphorylation. Therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway using small molecules have been conducted in numerous clinical trials [ , ]. \n\nOur group has previously demonstrated the additivity/synergy of drug combination between the JAK1/2 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib (Jakafi, ICNB018424), and BCL-XL inhibitor, Navitoclax in ATL models  . This combination was shown to inhibit the proliferation and tumor growth in a cytokine dependent ATL model and led to initiation of a Phase I/II clinical trial of Ruxolitinib for the treatment of ATL (NCT01712659). Although Ruxolitinib was previously approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis  , long term administration resulted in anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to its JAK2-inhibitory effects  . Thus, in this study, we focused on examining a specific JAK1 inhibitor to circumvent the off-target effect. \n\nUpadacitinib, also known as ABT-494, is a potent and selective JAK1 inhibitor with a specificity of 60-fold and >100 fold over JAK2 and JAK3 respectively  . Upadacitinib was demonstrated to suppress paw swelling and bone destruction in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model indicating its efficacy   in vivo  . Moreover, Upadacitinib received FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis after demonstrating significant radiographic and symptomatic improvement in these patients  . However, we expected that monotherapy with a JAK inhibitor would be insufficient therapy for smoldering/chronic ATL patients. Thus, we have identified AZD8055, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor from our high-throughput screening analysis as having profound additivity/synergy with Ruxolitinib.  . The therapeutic efficacy of Upadacitinib combined with mTOR inhibitors remain to be explored, particularly in smoldering and chronic ATL patients. \n\nAZD8055 is a first-in-class agent of a second generation of mTOR inhibitor that was designed to target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and act as an ATP-competitive inhibitor. mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates many major cellular processes such as survival, proliferation and metabolism  . Constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway has been found in multiple types of cancer and two of the first generation mTOR inhibitors have been approved by FDA, temsirolimus for the treatment of advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma   and Everolimus for tuberous sclerosis  . These two agents are rapamycin analogs and only inhibit mTORC1, whereas mTORC2 is known to directly activate AKT on Ser473 that regulates cell survival, apoptosis  . Thus, treatment with these rapamycin analogs have limited clinical efficacy and are associated with drug resistance [ , ]. \n\nIn contrast to the rapamycin analogs, AZD8055 inhibits the phosphorylation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates; p70S6K and 4E-BP1 and p-AKT, respectively  . The safety profile, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD8055, has been evaluated in advanced solid tumors and lymphomas and demonstrated acceptable toxicity  . Another dual ATP-competitive mTORC1/C2 inhibitor, Sapanisertib, also exhibited therapeutic effects in phase I trials in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia patients  . \n\nIn the current study, we demonstrated that Upadacitinib suppressed cell survival and proliferation of cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and dual inhibition of mTORC1/C2 with AZD8055 or Sapanisertib was more effective than Everolimus's mTORC1 inhibition alone. The combination of Upadacitinib with either AZD8055 or Sapanisertib showed synergistic effects on cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines, ATL cells from smoldering/chronic ATL patients, and in two xenograft models with NSG mice bearing tumors. These results indicate that the combination of JAK1i and mTORC1/2i has a significant promise as multi-agent therapy for patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Reagents and cell lines \n  \nUpadacitinib (ABT494), AZD8055 and Sapanisertib were purchased from Medchem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ). Human IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines; ED40515(+), ED41214(+), ATL55T(+) were kindly provided by Dr. Michiyuki Maeda (Kyoto University), KOB, LM-Y1, KK1 were provided by Dr. Yasuaki Yamada (Nagasaki University). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS with 100U/mL recombinant human IL-2. Human IL-2- independent ATL cell lines; ED40515(-), ED41214(-) and ATL43T\u03b2(-) were obtained from (Dr. Michiyuki Maeda, Kyoto University), ST1 (Dr. Tomoko Hata, Nagasaki University), Su9T01 (Dr. Naomichi Arima, Kagoshima University), ATN1 (Dr. Tomoki Naoe, Nagoya University) and MT1 (Dr. Miyoshi, Okayama University) and ALK(\u2212) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines; FEPD, Mac-1, Mac2A, Mac2B, TLBR1, TLBR2 were maintained in RPMI complete medium without cytokine. Human foreskin fibroblast cells were purchased from ATCC (Gaithersburg, MD). \n\n\n### Cell proliferation assay \n  \nTwenty thousand ATL cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 72 h either in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS with 100U/mL recombinant human IL-2 alone or in serial dilutions of drug combinations. On day 3, the cells were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi (0.037 MBq) of  H-thymidine during the last 6 h of culture. The cells were then harvested with a Tomtec cell harvester (Hamden, CT) and counted with a MicroBeta2 microplate counter (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). The assay was performed in three independent experiments. \n\n\n### Intracellular staining of p-STAT5 \n  \nHuman IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines were cultured with 1 \u03bcM of Upadacitinib for 1, 4 and 24 h. Control groups were incubated with DMSO. The cells were harvested at different time points and fixed with BD Phosflow\u2122 Lyse/Fix Buffer at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. After washing, the cells were permeabilized with cold BD Phosflow\u2122 Perm Buffer III on ice for 30 min followed by staining with Anti-Stat5 (pY694), Clone 47/Stat5 (pY694) for 1 h in staining buffer at room temperature. Cells were collected on FACS Calibur analysis (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). \n\n\n### Annexin V staining \n  \nCell apoptosis assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction using an Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and detected by flow cytometry. Cells were cultured with 1 \u03bcM of Upadacitinib or DMSO for 48 h and then labeled with Annexin V followed by FACS Calibur analysis. For patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), after 6-day   ex vivo   culture without cytokine, the enriched tumor cells were further cultured with either DMSO, Upadacitnib, AZD8055 or in combinations for an additional of 48 h and cells were subjected for Annexin V staining. \n\n\n### Cell cycle analysis \n  \nATL cell lines were cultured with 1 \u03bcM of AZD8055 or Everolimus or DMSO for 24 h. The cells were then labeled with 10 \u03bcM BrdU for 45 min. The BrdU-pulsed cells were stained according to the BrdU Flow Kit staining protocol (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometry. \n\n\n### Mouse model of ED40515(+)/IL-2 and therapeutic study \n  \nThe ED40515(+)/IL-2 cell line was generated as previously described  . The xenograft tumor model of human IL-2\u2013dependent ATL was established by subcutaneous injection of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10  ED40515 (+)/IL-2 cells into the right flank of female NOD.Cg-Prkdc IL2rg /SzJ (NSG) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Treatment was started ten days after tumor inoculation when the average tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm . Upadacitinib was dissolved in 30% PEG300 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a dose of 6 mg/kg per day by osmotic pump insertion or via the oral route daily for two weeks. AZD8055 (15 mg/kg/day) or Sapanisertib (1 mg/kg/day) were dissolved in 30% PEG300 and given orally for five times/week. Combination treatment was administered at the same dose and dosing schedules. Control mice receiving 30% PEG300 dissolved in water were used as a vehicle group. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor size in two orthogonal dimensions with tumor volume calculated using the formula \u00bd (long dimension) x (short dimension) . The level of human sIL-2R\u03b1 in serum of treated mice was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All animal experiments were approved by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (NCI ACUC) and were performed in accordance with NCI ACUC guidelines. \n\n\n###  Ex vivo   cultures of PBMCs from ATL patients \n  \nPeripheral blood samples were obtained from patient volunteers with chronic and smoldering ATLs under the care of the Clinical Trials Team, Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, NCI. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NCI. Informed consent was obtained in writing from patients. The proliferation assay of   ex vivo   6-day culture was performed as described previously  . Prior to   ex vivo   culture, we screened for the smoldering/chronic ATL patients by measuring CD4 CD25  in patient's blood using flow cytometry. PBMCs were isolated from patient blood by ficoll density gradient centrifugation and then cultured   ex vivo   in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS without cytokines either with DMSO or increasing doses of Upadacitinib, AZD8055 or in combination for 6 days. No stimuli were added to the culture to let the IL-2R\u03b1  leukemic cells activate, expand and enrich. The leukemic cells were pulsed during the last 6 h of incubation with 1 \u03bcCi of  H-thymidine, and then harvested and counted with a Micro Beta2 microplate counter. \n\n\n### Western blot analysis \n  \nWhole-cell lysates were collected using lysis buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturer's protocol, MCL-1 from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell lysates were electrophoresed on 4-12% Bis-Tris Novex gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting after blocking. Antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA); p-STAT5 (#9359), STAT5 (#94205), p-STAT3 (#9145), p-AKT-Ser473 (#4060), AKT (#9272), p-4E-BP1 (#2855), GAPDH (#5174). Monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (AC-74) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Signal intensity was quantified with ImageJ software. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nFor comparison between control, single agent and combination groups, one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significances. The two-way ANOVA was performed in the cell cycle analysis assay (GraphPad Prism software, version 7). For patient data, Mann-Whitney test was performed to determine statistical differences between groups. p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### JAK1 inhibition with Upadacitinib inhibited proliferation and phosphorylation of STAT5 in cytokine-dependent but not cytokine-independent ATL cell lines \n  \nWe previously demonstrated that the JAK1/2 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib diminished cell growth and proliferation of cytokine-dependent ATL but has limited potential as a therapeutic strategy  . To address the dose-limiting effects of JAK2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib, we evaluated a JAK1 inhibitor (JAK1i) with its better pharmacodynamics and specificity as an alternative to Ruxolitinib. Upadacitinib was highly effective as an inhibitor that inhibited the survival and proliferation of IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines; ED40515(+), ED41214 (+), ATL55T (+), KK1, KOB and LMY1. Limited or no inhibition was observed in the seven cytokine-independent ATL cell lines; ED40515 (-), ED41214 (-), ATL43T\u03b2 (-), ATN1, MT1, ST1 and Su9T01, which further demonstrating its specificity for JAK1   (   A)  . Furthermore, p-STAT5 expression was reduced at 24 h in the IL-2-dependent cell lines after JAK1 blockade   (   B)  . These results are consistent with our previous study   demonstrated that six IL-2-independent ATL cell lines did not express p-STAT5, therefore, JAK1i had no effect on the cytokine-independent ATL cell proliferation.   \n JAK1 inhibitor, Upadactinib inhibited proliferation and phosphorylation of STAT5 in cytokine dependent but not cytokine independent ATL cell lines  . \n\n(A) Dose response curves of Upadacitinib on human IL-2 dependent (blue) and IL-2\u2013independent (red) ATL cell lines. Six IL-2\u2013dependent and seven IL-2\u2013independent ATL cell lines were treated with increasing doses of Upadacitinib for 72 h and the cell proliferation was measured with a thymidine incorporation assay. The figures are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Western blot analysis of p-STAT5 and STAT5 protein at 24 h after treatment with 1 \u00b5M of Upadacitinib. The figure images are representative of two biological replicates. (C) The time course of p-STAT5 inhibition by Upadacitinib. ED40515(+) and LMY1 were incubated with 1 \u03bcM Upadacitinib for 1 h, 4h or 24 h and analyzed for p-STAT5 expression by flow cytometry. Cells incubated with DMSO were used as a control. The figures are representative of three independent experiments. (D) Induction of cell apoptosis by Upadacitinib. ED40515(+) and LMY1 were treated with Upadacitinib or DMSO for 48 h and the cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V staining (n=3). Human fibroblast cells were used as a control. Student   t-  test was performed to determine statistical differences, **p <0.01, ****p<0.0001. The figures are representative of three independent experiments. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nRuxolitinib has a short half-life of approximately 3 h, which requires at least twice daily (b.i.d.) administration   whereas with Upadacitinib's half-life of 6-16 h would probably allow for less frequent dosing  . Thus, we sought to determine the pharmacodynamics of Upadacitinib in inhibiting p-STAT5 in IL-2-dependent cell lines. Upadacitinib exhibited longer pharmacodynamic effects with a robust inhibition of p-STAT5 at 1 h that was maintained for up to 4 h. The p-STAT5 expression increased at 24 h but had not reached the baseline   (   C)  . Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of Upadacitinib on cell apoptosis with Annexin V staining. Upadacitnib induced apoptosis in cytokine dependent ATL cell lines, ED40515(+) and LMY1 cell lines after 48 h of treatment, whereas fibroblasts did not respond to the inhibitor   (   D)  . \n\n\n### Dual inhibition of mTORC1/C2 with AZD8055 was more effective than the single mTORC1 inhibitor Everolimus, in cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines \n  \nFrom our high-throughput screening results, AZD8055, an mTORC1/C2 inhibitor, demonstrated an additive/synergistic effect with Ruxolitinib suggesting that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was essential for ATL cell survival. We confirmed the screening results by performing a cell proliferation assay with AZD8055. In parallel, we also evaluated another FDA-approved mTORC1 inhibitor, Everolimus. As seen in the dose response curves, AZD8055 had an antiproliferative effect against 13 ATL cell lines regardless of cytokine-dependency. In contrast, Everolimus had little effect on ATL cell line proliferation   (   A)  . The IC50 of IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent cell lines treated with AZD8055 or Everolimus were determined and summarized on   Supplementary Table S1  . Similar results were previously described in ATL cell lines with ED40515 (-), Hut102 (-), MT2 (-) and ATL43T(+) by Kawata and colleagues   who showed that dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 was more effective than single blockade of mTORC1 as mTORC2 has the ability to directly activate AKT that in turn augments cell survival. We also examined phosphorylated AKT at Ser-473, a direct substrate of mTORC2, in the six IL-2 dependent ATL cell lines and found that only AZD8055 but not Everolimus inhibited AKT phosphorylation   (   B)   suggesting that dual targeting of mTORC1/C2 is required to suppress ATL cell proliferation. We further examined the effects of AZD8055 and Everolimus on the cell cycle analysis. We demonstrated that AZD8055 markedly induced cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in ED40515(+) (p<0.0001), ATL55T (+) (p<0.0001) and KK1 (p<0.0395) cell lines compared to the Everolimus-treated or DMSO groups (p<0.0001). Moreover, the cells entering S phase were significantly decreased in the AZD8055-treated group compared to the DMSO control (p<0.0001) group or the Everolimus-treated group in ED40515(+) (p<0.0001), ATL55T(+) (p<0.0001), and KK1 (p<0.0418) cell lines   (   C)  .   \n Dual inhibition of mTORC1/C2 with AZD8055 was more effective than the single mTORC1 inhibitor, Everolimus, with cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines  . \n\n(A) Dose response curves of AZD8055 versus Everolimus inhibition on human ATL cell lines. Six IL-2\u2013dependent and seven IL-2\u2013independent ATL cell lines were treated with increasing doses of AZD8055 or Everolimus inhibitors for 72 h and the cell proliferation was measured with a thymidine incorporation assay. The figures are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Western blot analysis of p-AKT and total AKT protein after treatment with 1 \u00b5M of AZD8055 or Everolimus for 24 h. The figures are representative of two biological replicates. (C) Effect of AZD8055 versus Everolimus on cell cycle analysis. ED40515(+), ATL55T (+) and KK1 were treated with inhibitors or DMSO for 24 h and labeled with BrdU for 45 min. The percentages of G0/G1, S, or G2/M phases were evaluated with BrdU and 7AAD staining by flow cytometry. Two-way ANOVA was performed to determine statistical differences (n=4). Representative flow plots of three independent experiments are shown. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### The combination of Upadacitinib and AZD8055 showed synergistic effect with cytokine\u2013dependent ATL cell lines \n  \nAs a result of additive/synergistic effects between Ruxolitinib and AZD8055, we hypothesized that Upadacitinib with AZD8055 would display the same effect. We initially examined these combinations in primary T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in which the activation of JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are known to be pervasive. The combinations of these two inhibitors, Upadacitinib (15.6 nM to 250 nM) and AZD8055 (31.2 nM to 500 nM) were synergistic in inhibiting T-cell proliferation with increasing doses of this drug combination evaluated in four different PBMCs populations isolated from healthy donors   (Supplementary Fig. 1)  . Consistently, Upadacitinib and AZD8055 showed synergistic effect with the six cytokine\u2013dependent ATL cell lines   (   )   while the same treatment had no effect on fibroblast proliferation, demonstrating the specificity of these effects on ATL cell lines. Because cytokine\u2013independent ATL cell lines did not respond to the JAK1 inhibitor, the synergistic effect of these two inhibitors was not observed in these cell lines   (Supplementary Fig. 3)  . To measure synergistic effect between Upadacitinib and AZD8055, we used Chou-Talalay method   to quantify whether the interaction is additive or synergistic. The combination index (CI) values were generated when two drugs were combined at a constant ratio. CI values less than 1 indicates synergism. The synergistic effect of this drug combination was observed in six IL-2 dependent ATL cell lines with CI values less than 1 over five different concentrations   (Supplementary Table 2).   CI plots of synergism represents each individual combination data point in   Supplementary Fig. 2  .   \n The combination of Upadacitinib and AZD8055 showed synergy with cytokine\u2013dependent ATL cell lines  . \n\nThe combined effects of Upadacitinib with AZD8055 inhibitors on six IL-2\u2013dependent ATL cell lines incubated for 72 h in the presence of five increasing concentrations of Upadacitinib (blue), AZD8055 (orange), or their combinations (green). Fibroblast cells were used as a control. A thymidine incorporation assay was performed, and percentages of control were calculated from the counts per minutes (cpm) of samples with drugs divided by the cpm of samples with no inhibitor x 100. Representative figures of three independent experiments are shown. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n### Therapeutic effects of the Upadacitinib and AZD8055 combination in suppressing tumor growth in xenograft mice bearing ED40515(+)/IL-2 transgenic tumors and ALK (-) ALCL tumors \n  \nTo evaluate the efficacy of this combination   in vivo  , we used the ED40515(+) cell line that expresses the human IL-2 transgene with a retroviral system  . The ED40515(+)/IL-2 transgenic tumor has the ability to grow in immunodeficient NOD/SCID/\u03b3  (NSG) mice without an external supply of human IL-2 cytokine. Upadacitinib was administered either by continuous infusion pump   (   A)   or orally   (Supplementary Fig. 4A)  . The results of treatment showed that Upadacitinib suppressed the tumor growth via infusion pump better than by the oral route. Single agents of Upadacitinib or AZD8055 delayed the tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice compared to vehicle control mice. The combination therapy with Upadacitinib and AZD8055 dramatically reduced tumor volumes compared with single agents alone, whereas Upadacitinib combined with Everolimus showed little effect   (Supplementary Fig. 4B)  . Furthermore, we determined the level of soluble IL-2R\u03b1, which is a surrogate tumor marker, in the serum of treated mice after two weeks of treatment. Consistent with the decreased tumor volume, the level of sIL-2R\u03b1 was meaningfully reduced in the combined-treatment group with Upadacitinib and AZD8055 compared to single agent-treated mice   (   B)  .   \n Therapeutic effects of the Upadacitinib and AZD8055 combination in suppressing tumor growth in xenograft mice bearing ED40515(+)/IL-2 transgenic tumors and ALK (-) ALCL tumor  . \n\nTen million ED40515(+)/IL-2 or 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10  TLBR1 cell lines were subcutaneously implanted in NSG mice. The therapy was started when average tumor volumes reached around 100 mm . Upadacitinib was administered by pump at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day and AZD8055 was given orally at a dose of 15 mg/kg for 14 days. The vehicle group received 30% PEG300 dissolved in water. (A) Average tumor volumes during the therapeutic time course were measured twice weekly until the tumor volume reached 2000 mm  (n=10-12). (B) Serum levels of human soluble IL-2R\u03b1 (sIL-2R\u03b1) were measured on day 14 after treatment with ELISA assay. Two independent experiments were performed, and data were pooled together. (C) The combined effects of Upadacitinb with AZD8055 inhibitors on the TLBR1 cell line incubated for 72 h in the presence of five different drug concentrations and cell proliferation was measured with a thymidine incorporation assay. Representative figures of three independent experiments are shown. (D) Average tumor volumes were measured during the therapeutic time course of drug combination on the TLBR1 model (n=5-6). One-way ANOVA was performed to determine statistical differences **p <0.01, ****p<0.0001. \n  Fig. 4   \n\nWe further examined another xenograft mouse model that involves an ALK (-) ALCL tumor wherein the JAK/STAT pathway was also reported to be activated in ALK(\u2212) ALCL patients  . Similar results were also observed when the TLBR1 cell line was implanted. Treatment with Upadacitinib or AZD8055 alone moderately diminished tumor growth. Notably, the combination of Upadacitinib and AZD8055 significantly suppressed tumor growth as evidenced by decreased cell proliferation and tumor volume in the combined-treated group   (   C-D)  . These   in vivo   results correlated with the decreased cell proliferation, p-STAT3 and p-AKT expressions in ALCL cell lines   (Supplementary Fig. 5A-B)  . \n\n\n### Antiproliferative effect of the Upadacitinib and AZD8055 combination on the 6-day   ex vivo   spontaneous proliferation of ATL cells isolated from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL \n  \nOur established 6-day   ex vivo   culture of PBMCs containing ATLs from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL demonstrated the activation of JAK/STAT signaling associated with spontaneous leukemic cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that the leukemic cells of smoldering/chronic ATL patients constitutively expressed IL-2R\u03b1 whereas resting normal T cells do not express this marker  . This autonomous proliferation of leukemic cells in smoldering/chronic ATL patients occurs in an IL-2/IL-2R\u03b1 dependent manner but it also requires autologous monocytes to fully induce proliferation via cell-cell contact  . In contrast, PBMCs from acute ATL patients do not proliferate or proliferated independent of cytokines. Therefore, autocrine stimulation by IL-2/IL-2R\u03b1 interaction is not observed in acute ATL patients. \n\nPrior to   ex vivo   culture, we screened for smoldering/chronic ATL patients by measuring CD4 CD25  in patient's blood by flow cytometry. No stimuli were added throughout 6-day culture to let the IL-2R\u03b1  leukemic cells activate, expand and enrich. Robust inhibition of ATL cells in   ex vivo   culture proliferation was demonstrated in five ATL patients when Upadacitinib and AZD8055 were added to the cultures. Cell proliferation was inhibited more than 95% when the combination of 250 nM Upadacitinib and 500 nM AZD8055 were used   (   A)  . The CI values indicates synergistic effect of this drug combination are shown on   Supplementary Table 3  . We further examined the molecular pathways present on the leukemic cells when the number of ATL cells were enriched after 6 days. By culturing the ex vivo cultured ATL cells with the drug combination, Upadacitinib potently inhibited p-STAT5 and AZD8055 suppressed the expression of p-AKT and p-4EBP1 which is in line with the results of the cell proliferation assay (  B)  . Induction of cell apoptosis was also enhanced in the combination-treated group   (   C)  .   \n Antiproliferative effect of the Upadacitinib and AZD8055 combination on the 6-day   ex vivo   spontaneous proliferation of ATL cells in PBMCs isolated from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL  . \n\n(A) Anti-proliferative effects of Upadacitinib and AZD8055 combination on ATL cells in PBMCs from five smoldering/chronic ATL patients cultured   ex vivo   for 6 days in the presence of increasing concentrations of Upadacitinib (blue), AZD8055 (orange), or their combinations (green). Average percentages of control are shown from five patients at the concentrations of 250 nM Upadacitinib or 500 nM AZD8055 or in combinations (n=5). Five biological replicates were performed. Error bars represent \u00b1 SEM. Mann-Whitney test was performed to determine statistical differences *p <0.05, **p<0.01. (B) Western blot analysis of p-STAT5, p-AKT and p-4EBP1 after 6-day   ex vivo   culture treated with 1 \u00b5M Upadacitinib or AZD8055 or combination for 1 h. Three biological replicates were performed. (C) Annexin V staining, after induction of cell apoptosis by drug combination on ATL cells in patient's PBMC after 6-day   ex vivo   culture. \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n### The combination of Upadacitinib and Sapanisertib showed synergistic effect with cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines, PBMCs containing ATL cells from ATL patients and in a xenograft mouse model \n  \nAZD8055 displayed anti-proliferative effects against ATL cell lines, however, the clinical development of this inhibitor has not been advanced meaningfully due to treatment related abnormal liver functions  . Therefore, we examined another mTORC1/C2 inhibitor with similar efficacy as AZD8055. Sapanisertib is an oral ATP-dependent mTORC1/C2 inhibitor that showed potent antitumor activity by suppressing in a metastatic prostate cancer model  . Moreover, Sapanisertib is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for various types of cancer [ , ]. In examining the dose response curves of Sapanisertib in IL-2 dependent ATL cell lines, Sapanisertib demonstrated anti-proliferative effects similar to those by AZD8055   (   A)  . However, the AZD8055 showed higher potency in cytokine-independent ATL cell lines as IC50 of AZD8055 is slightly lower than Sapanisertib (Supplementary Table S1). Fibroblasts were used as a negative control to confirm drug specificity. The level of cell inhibition also correlated with the decreased expression of p-AKT at Ser-473   (   B)  . Furthermore, the combination of Upadacitinib with Sapanisertib demonstrated synergistic effect in six cytokine\u2013dependent ATL cell lines   (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4)   and in ATL cells from PBMCs isolated from two patients with smoldering/chronic ATL   (   C and Supplementary Table 5)  . Importantly, similar therapeutic efficacy   in vivo   of this drug combination was also observed in xenograft mice bearing ED40515(+)/IL-2 transgenic tumors   (   D)   comparable to as that observed in the combination with AZD8055.   \n The combination of Upadacitinib and Sapanisertib showed synergistic effect with cytokine\u2013dependent ATL cell lines, PBMCs containing ATL cells from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL and in a xenograft mouse model  . \n\n(A) Dose response curves of mTORC1/C2i, Sapanisertib, on human ATL cell lines.

Two biological replicates were performed. (D) Average tumor volumes during the therapeutic time course of Upadacitinib administered by pump at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day and Sapanisertib given orally at 1 mg/kg for 14 days (n=10-12). One-way ANOVA was performed to determine statistical differences **p <0.01, ***p <0.001, ****p<0.0001. Data were pooled from two independent experiments. \n  Fig. 6   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPreviously, we demonstrated that the JAK/STAT pathway is critical for smoldering/chronic ATL cell survival and JAK1/2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib blocked STAT5 phosphorylation and reduced proliferation of IL-2\u2013dependent ATL cell lines  . However, JAK2 is involved in the regulation of the platelet and red blood cell production as thrombopoietin and erythropoietin receptors utilize JAK2 for signaling, thus, the effects of JAK2 inhibition by Ruxolitinib led to adverse events of anemia and thrombocytopenia  . In the present study, we sought to replace Ruxolitinib with a specific JAK1 inhibitor to address this concern while enhancing specificity. Our current work demonstrates that Upadacitinib is highly specific for JAK1 and its efficacy could be enhanced by combining with mTOCR1/C2 inhibitors in smoldering/chronic ATL model. \n\nThe Tax protein of HTLV-1 transactivates IL-2R\u03b1 on smoldering/chronic ATL cells leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway and spontaneous cell proliferation. However, with acute ATL or some transformed cells, they do not rely on JAK/STAT for survival and growth. Thus, this combination therapy targeting JAK1 and mTOR pathways could only be applied with smoldering/chronic ATL and not on acute ATL patients  . It has been suggested that ATL cells progressing away from cytokine dependence continue to accumulate transforming mutations and epigenetic changes  . Deciphering the potential differences between cytokine dependent and independent ATL cells could prove valuable at the level of therapeutics. \n\nThe utilization of JAK1 inhibitor may have broader application against other types of T cell malignancies possessing an activated JAK/STAT pathway such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)   or ALK (-) ALCL patients   as the autocrine IL-2/IL-2R\u03b1 loop mediates spontaneous proliferation, is also present in these patients. For ALK (-) ALCL patients, the 5-year overall survival rate was poorer than ALK (+) with 49% and 70% respectively  . ALK (-) ALCL patients were generally responsive to standard first-line treatment of chemotherapy regimens but tumor relapse often occurred [ , ]. Our results indicate that the combination of JAK1i and mTORC1/C2i inhibition treatment has significant potential in a disease driven by JAK/STAT activation including ALK (-) ALCL cells ( C-D), which rely on IL-6 signaling through JAK1/JAK2/STAT3 pathway  . \n\nPreclinical evaluation of several FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin analogs, demonstrated limited efficacy suggesting that mTORC1 targeting alone is insufficient [ , ]. Kawata and colleagues   demonstrated superior efficacy of the dual inhibitors, PP242 and AZD8055, compared to mTORC1 inhibitors, rapamycin and Everolimus with ATL cell lines which have the benefit of blocking the AKT feedback activation loop. In our study with cytokine-dependent cell lines, we noted similar effects with AZD8055 that also inhibited p-AKT (S-473) and was more efficient in inducing cell cycle arrest and in suppressing the tumor growth than Everolimus. These results suggest that dual inhibition of mTOR is required for effective treatment of ATL patients. \n\nNevertheless, patients treated in a phase I clinical trial of AZD8055 showed hepatic dysfunction with elevated levels of transaminases that precluded further clinical development  . Such liver function abnormalities were not observed with other mTORC1 inhibitors such as Temsorilmus and Everolimus. Therefore, we investigated another dual mTOR inhibitor, Sapanisertib. In the first clinical trial of Sapanisertib in hematologic malignancies, it was well tolerated, and patients exhibited partial responses in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. This study also suggested that Sapanisertib could be used in combination with other agents as it showed limited efficacy as a single agent  . \n\nTaken as a whole, our preclinical studies suggest the importance of the JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in the survival of smoldering or chronic ATL malignant lymphocytes. The combination of Upadacitinib with Sapanisertib demonstrated high potency and synergy and supports a proposed Phase I/II clinical trial with this two-agent combination for smoldering/chronic ATL patients. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interests \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7585144, "text_md5": "35003417eb53453e10eb1cadff504837", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 216], "journal": [217, 229], "publication_year": [231, 235], "title": [246, 350], "keywords": [364, 616], "abstract": [629, 2673], "body": [2682, 38447]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33129109, "doi": "10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100913", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585144", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7585144"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585144\">7585144</a>", "list_title": "PMC7585144  Enhanced efficacy of JAK1 inhibitor with mTORC1/C2 targeting in smoldering/chronic adult T cell leukemia"}

Observational literature has shown that educational attainment (EA) and cognitive performance (CP) influence suicide attempt risk; however, the causal nature of these relationships is unknown. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of EA, CP, and suicide attempt risk with > 815,000 combined white participants of European ancestry, we performed multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to disentangle the effects of EA and CP on attempted suicide. In single-variable MR (SVMR), EA and CP appeared to reduce suicide attempt risk (EA odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in EA (4.2 years), 0.524, 95% CI, 0.412\u20130.666,   P  \u2009=\u20091.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ; CP OR per SD increase in standardized score, 0.714, 95% CI, 0.577\u20130.885,   P  \u2009=\u20090.002). Conversely, bidirectional analyses found no effect of a suicide attempt on EA or CP. Using various multivariable MR (MVMR) models, EA seems to be the predominant risk factor for suicide attempt risk with the independent effect (OR, 0.342, 95% CI, 0.206\u20130.568,   P  \u2009=\u20091.61\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ), while CP had no effect (OR, 1.182, 95% CI, 0.842\u20131.659,   P  \u2009=\u20090.333). In additional MVMR analyses accounting simultaneously for potential behavioral and psychiatric mediators (tobacco smoking; alcohol consumption; and self-reported nerves, tension, anxiety, or depression), the effect of EA was little changed (OR, 0.541, 95% CI, 0.421\u20130.696,   P  \u2009=\u20093.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). Consistency of results across complementary MR methods accommodating different assumptions about genetic pleiotropy strengthened causal inference. Our results show that even after accounting for psychiatric disorders and behavioral mediators, EA, but not CP, may causally influence suicide attempt risk among white individuals of European ancestry, which could have important implications for health policy and programs aimed at reducing the increasing rates of suicide. Future work is necessary to examine the EA\u2013suicide relationship populations of different ethnicities. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSuicide is a leading cause of death with ~800,000 deaths per year worldwide . While suicide rates vary by country, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States has increased 33% from 1999 to 2017 with more than 120 Americans dying by suicide every day . With an estimated 2.1 million discharges for self-inflicted injuries from emergency departments and acute care hospitals reported in the US in 2013 alone  and $50.8 billion in medical expenditures and lost productivity , suicidal behavior is a major public health and economic burden . Given the incalculable emotional and psychological costs, the true public health burden of suicidality is difficult to estimate ; however, these statistics highlight the importance of identifying causal risk factors for developing effective suicide reduction and prevention strategies . \n\nThe relationship between mental health, educational attainment (EA), and cognitive performance (CP) are well documented  with up to 54% of college students acknowledging suicidal ideation at some point during college , and a recent longitudinal study showing that a history of suicide planning and attempt(s) prior to matriculation was associated with decreased college academic performance . In addition, observational literature has shown that low EA may be a major risk factor for suicidal behavior throughout the life course , which may contribute to the disparity in mortality across socioeconomic strata . However, this relationship between EA and suicide behavior is complex and potentially confounded by CP, which is strongly associated with EA  and also linked to suicidal behavior . Like the EA\u2013suicide behavior relationship, there is evidence suggesting a bidirectional association . \n\nHowever, caution is needed when inferring causality from multivariable-adjusted regression in observational data , and observational studies are subject to reverse causation and residual confounding  not only from correlated factors like CP and other socioeconomic status indices and cultural factors, but also from psychiatric symptoms and disorders, and potential behavioral mediators, also shown to affect suicidal behavior . While randomized control trials (RCTs) are the \u201cgold standard\u201d of causal inference , it is impossible (unethical) to construct an RCT examining the effects of either EA or CP on suicidal behavior. Therefore, it remains to be elucidated whether low EA and/or low CP are causes or consequences of suicidal behavior. \n\nMendelian randomization (MR) is a genetic epidemiology method that uses randomly inherited genetic variants as instrumental variables to assess possible causal relationships between environmental exposures (e.g., EA, CP), and outcomes (e.g., suicidal behavior). As genetic variants are not modifiable by confounders, MR is analogous to RCTs, except randomization occurs at meiosis . If the genetically predicted values of the environmental exposure are associated with the outcome, then causal inference may be drawn from their association , and thus MR is an important analytical strategy when RCTs are impractical or unethical . \n\nThe pathways to suicidal behavior are complex and involve the dynamic interaction of psychological, genetic, social, and cultural factors , and while the precise genetic basis of suicidal behavior remains largely unknown , studies have shown that the genetic basis of suicidal behavior is polygenic, heritable and, in part, distinct from that of psychiatric disorders , while recent sufficiently powered genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified the first conventional genome-wide significant (GWS) (  P  \u2009<\u20095 \u00d710 ) loci associated with suicide attempts in both the general population  and in a psychiatric cohort . There are also a growing number of MR studies using genetic data to investigate the relationship between suicide and modifiable risk factors, such as smoking . \n\nEA and CP are strongly influenced by social, cultural, environmental factors ; however, they are also polygenic and heritable . Further, the genetic components explain a non-trivial percentage of their variance with a recent GWAS in 1.1 million participants found polygenic scores constructed to explain between 11\u201313% and 7\u201310% of the variance in EA and CP, respectively . EA is also one of the most widely studied exposures in the MR field with evidence for the causal effects of EA on many behaviors and health outcomes, including alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol dependence (AD) , smoking , physical activity , and cardiovascular disease . \n\nThese conventional MR studies suggest that increasing years of education would help address health disparities, but failing to account for CP, which could be potentially driving the observed protective effect of increased EA if not accounted for in the analyses has important for implications for the formulation and evaluation of targeted prevention programs aimed at increasing EA to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these outcomes and would be important for strategies aimed at reducing suicide. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recently developed method that allows for simultaneous assessment of separate but correlated exposures  by incorporating genetic variants from each risk factor into the same model . MVMR has been recently employed to disentangle the independent effect for each risk factor for a range of health outcomes: e.g., Richardson et al.  recently used an MVMR framework to compare the causal roles of lipids and apolipoproteins with coronary heart disease found that the effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were attenuated in MVMR models accounting for other lipids and lipoproteins. Similarly, MVMR has been used to evaluate the total and direct effects of EA, and CP with many health and behavioral outcomes including smoking , alcohol consumption, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) . \n\nIn this study, we used the largest publicly available GWASs on EA (  N  \u2009\u2264\u2009766,345) , CP (  N  \u2009\u2264\u2009257,828) , hospital-based records of either a primary or secondary diagnosis of a suicide attempt (  N  \u2009\u2264\u200950,264)  to comprehensively examine the relationship between EA, CP, and suicide attempts. We first performed a conventional bidirectional MR analysis to identify the direction of the relationship(s). We then leveraged recently developed MVMR methods to identify whether EA or CP to identify the direct causal effect of one exposure controlling for the other (i.e., the effect of EA holding CP constant). Finally, given the strong genetic correlation of EA and CP with markers of socioeconomic status (SES) , and, further, possible confounding from comorbid mental disorders (major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD)), psychiatric symptoms (feeling tense, anxious, or depressed), and potential behavioral mediators (tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) we performed additional MVMR analyses incorporating household income , MDD, schizophrenia, BD, alcohol consumption , past or current smoking status , self-reported visits to a general practitioner (GP) or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension or depression (  N  \u2009\u2264\u2009460,702)  to evaluate the robustness of the main EA\u2013suicide analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design and data sources \n  \nFigure   displays the overall design of the study for the two-sample SVMR and MVMR analyses of the effect of EA and CP on the risk of a suicide attempt\u2014adjusting for total household income (before taxes), alcohol consumption, past or current smoking status, and self-reported visits to a general practitioner or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension or depression. We used publicly available summary statistics from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC), the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH), and the Medical Research Center-Integrative Epidemiology Center, UK Bristol (MRC-IEU) UK Biobank GWAS Pipeline (Supplementary Table  ; web links for downloading data provided).

Using the standard heuristic significance threshold for these dimensional MR studies to make the work manageable, we included all SNPs associated at genome-wide significance (GWS) (  P  \u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) with the phenotype \u201ceducational attainment\u201d (EA); due to educational systems differences across cohorts, EA had been constructed for the GWAS meta-analysis from an imputed years-of-education equivalent for each International Standard Classification of Education category mapped from each cohort\u2019s survey measures. Across all cohorts (excluding the 23andMe cohort due to institutional restrictions), the sample-size weighted mean of EA is 16.8 years of schooling (standard deviation (s.d.) 4.2 years). Genetic association results are presented in s.d. units. We pruned the resultant list of GWS SNPs to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD)   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nWe extracted SNPs for CP from the companion SSGAC GWAS meta-analysis of the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT) GWAS on general cognitive performance in 35,298 individuals, combined with the GWAS of cognitive performance in 222,543 individuals of the UK Biobank prospective cohort study, both of predominantly European ancestry (sample size   N  \u2009=\u2009257,841). We included all SNPs associated with CP at GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095 \u00d7\u200910 ). In the COGENT study, the phenotype was defined as the first principle component of three or more neuropsychological tests, including but not limited to tests assessing digit span, digit symbol coding, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency, trail-making, verbal memory for stories, verbal memory for words, visual memory, vocabulary and word reading (mean\u2009=\u20090.00, s.d. = 0.99); in the UK Biobank, the phenotype was defined as the standardized score (mean\u2009=\u20090.00, s.d. = 1.00) on up to four tests comprised of a 2-min verbal-numerical assessment of fluid intelligence (comprised of thirteen logic and reasoning questions): the genetic correlation between the score and general intelligence among children has been shown in prior studies to be ~0.8. SNP heritability for cognitive performance was found to be 0.209 (standard error (s.e.) = 0.007). LD score regression indicated a genetic overlap between cognitive performance and years of schooling (rG\u2009=\u20090.662, s.e. = 0.011). Genetic association results are presented in s.d. units. We pruned the resultant list of GWS SNPs to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u2009.001 (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nTo account for income in our MVMR analyses, we extracted SNPs from the MRC-IEU UK Biobank GWAS based on the responses of 397,751 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study . We included all SNPs associated at GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) with the PHESANT-derived phenotype (UK Biobank data-field 738) from five categorically ordered responses of the study, with the first category \u201cless than \u00a318,000\u201d, up the fifth category \u201cmore than \u00a3100,000\u201d, categorizing average total household income before tax (income). We pruned the results to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nTo account for alcohol consumption, we extracted SNPs from the 2017 SSGAC GWAS for units of alcohol consumption based on the responses of 112,117 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study on average weekly alcohol consumption of a range of alcohol drink types, including red wine, white wine, champagne, spirits, beer, and cider . We included all SNPs associated at GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095 \u00d7\u200910 ) with the constructed phenotype and pruned the results to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001, leaving 36 independent SNPs (Supplementary Table  ). Mean consumption for respondent females was 10.0 alcohol units per week (standard deviation (s.d.) = 1.8) and for males, 20.8 units per week (s.d.\u2009= 19.0), and, overall, 15.1 units per week (s.d. = 16.6): large genetic overlap and genetic overlap between male and female consumption were found (rG\u2009=\u20090.90, s.e.= 0.09,   P  \u2009=\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). SNP heritability was 0.13 (standard error (s.e.) = 0.01) overall, 0.15 (s.e. = 0.01) for males, and 0.13 (s.e. = 0.01) for females. LD score regression indicated a genetic overlap between alcohol consumption and years of schooling (rG\u2009=\u20090.18, s.e. = 0.03). \n\nWe extracted SNPs from the MRC-IEU UK Biobank GWAS to account for ever smoker status based on the responses of 461,066 individuals of European ancestry (280,508 cases; 180,588 controls) again from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study . We included all SNPs associated at GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095 \u00d710 ) with the PHESANT-derived phenotype (UK Biobank data-field 20160), constructed from responses on current and past tobacco smoking: individuals were classified as \u201cever smoker\u201d if they responded \u201cmost days\u201d or \u201coccasionally\u201d to the current tobacco smoking query or if they responded \u201cmost days\u201d, \u201coccasionally\u201d, or \u201ctried once or twice\u201d to the past tobacco smoking query. We pruned the results to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nSimilarly, we extracted SNPs from the MRC-IEU UK Biobank GWAS to account for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression, based alternatively upon the responses of 459,560 individuals of European ancestry (158,561 cases; 300,995 controls) to the query about ever having seen a general practitioner for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression, and upon the responses of 460,702 individuals (53,414 cases; 407,288 controls) to the query about ever having seen a psychiatrist for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression, in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study . We included all SNPs associated at GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) with the PHESANT-derived phenotypes (UK Biobank data-field 2090 and 2100, respectively), pruned to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). To account for having a history of any psychotic experiences, we used summary association data from the recent Legge et al.  GWAS in the UK Biobank (6123 cases; 121,843 controls) (Supplementary Table  ). We pruned the results to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nTo account for potential confounding by major psychiatric disorders, we included additional analyses using summary association data from three GWAS that did not include the iPSYCH cohort in the analysis\u2014probable MDD (30,603 cases; 143, 916 controls) , schizophrenia (35,476 cases; 46, 839 controls) , and BD (7647 cases; 27,303 controls)  (Supplementary Table  ). We pruned the association data to exclude all SNPs with a pairwise LD   r  \u2009>\u20090.001 (Supplementary Table  ). The samples were of white, European ancestry, except for the schizophrenia data were of predominantly white, European ancestry, but contained 1866 cases and 3414 controls of East Asian ancestry, too . \n\nFor our MVMR analyses combining EA and CP, along with income, alcohol consumption, ever smoker status, and alternatively, ever having seen a general practitioner or psychiatrist for nerves, tension, anxiety, or depression, we included all independent SNPs (LD   r  \u2009<\u20090.001; 10,000\u2009kb window), which were GWS (  P  \u2009<\u20095 \u00d7\u200910 ) in any the GWASs (Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n### Suicide attempt outcomes \n  \nWe extracted summary statistics on the associations of the instruments SNPs with suicide attempt (SA) from the recent iPSYCH GWASs in a sample constructed from a cohort of 1,472,762 singletons born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005 and residing in Denmark on their first birthday, including 57,377 participants diagnosed with one or more mental disorders according to the 10th Revision of International Classification of Diseases (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, affective disorders, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia) and, additionally, a non-psychiatric population-based random sample of 30,000 participants drawn also from the cohort . Sample participants were further screened by the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and National Registry of Patients for diagnoses of non-fatal suicide attempts; cases also included those with combinations of diagnoses with the main diagnoses recorded as a mental disorder, and a secondary diagnosis recorded as poisoning by drugs or other substances, or injuries to the hand, wrist, and forearm, well-established proxies for suicide attempt . The control group consisted of all persons not diagnosed with one or more suicide attempts with and without diagnosed mental disorders. After quality control, and excluding children, 50,264 persons remained in the sample for the GWAS, of which 6024 (12%) recorded at least one suicide attempt, and 44,240 (88%) did not . For the 6024 cases, 17.9% were aged 15\u201319 years, 37.2% 20\u201324 years, 35.6% 25\u201329 years, and 9.4% 30\u201334 years; 54.7% of the cases had 1 recorded suicide attempt; 22.4%, 2; 14.8%, 3\u20134; 6.9%, 5\u20139; and 2.0%, 10 or more. \n\nThe iPSYCH GWAS (model 1) used for the main anlayses did not account for comorbid mental disorders: the GWAS was conducted using logistic regression to calculate the log odds ratio of the risk of suicide attempt with the only gender, years followed, and first ten principal components of genetic ancestry included as covariates. The companion iPSYCH GWAS (model 2) accounted for comorbid mental disorders by including a series of binary covariates for diagnoses of the following: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, affective disorder, autism spectrum disorders, anorexia, and \u201cany other disorder\u201d. We adopted the \u201cModel 1\u201d and \u201cModel 2\u201d notation for the purposes of this study. Cognizant of the potential for collider bias in GWAS analyses adjusting for environmental covariates since genetic variants may be, in theory, associated with both the primary outcome (here suicide attempt) and the covariates used for an adjustment (i.e., psychiatric disorders) , we used the iPSYCH model 2 solely as a sensitivity analysis used in addition to the MVMR analyses including psychiatric symptoms, alcohol consumption, smoking, MDD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. \n\n\n### Extraction of instruments from outcome GWASs and harmonization of effect alleles \n  \nOf the 318 possible GWS SNPs associated with EA, 270 SNPs were present in both iPSYCH models 1 and 2 suicide attempt (SA) risk GWASs, and 46 SNPs were removed during harmonization for being palindromic with intermediate allele frequency, leaving 224 SNPs for SVMR analysis. Of the 157 possible SNPs associated with CP, 127 SNPs were present in the SA GWASs, and 23 SNPs were removed during harmonization for being palindromic with intermediate allele frequency, leaving 104 SNPs for SVMR analysis. Of the 333 possible independent SNPs of the combined MVMR instrument set, 265\u2013288 SNPs were present in the SA GWASs, depending on the combination of exposures. We calculated the   F  -statistics and the   F  -statistic 95% confidence interval (95% CI) lower bound (in parentheses) for each exposure to assess the strength of each of the instruments present in the SA GWAS, and all exceeded the threshold   F  -statistic of 10 recommended for MR analysis  (EA   F  -statistic 59.8 (95% CI lower bound 58.1); CP 55.2 (52.9); household income: 45.3 (41.9); alcohol consumption 31.8 (28.6); ever smoker status 48.8 (45.8); ever seen a general practitioner for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression 31.0 (27.6); and ever seen a psychiatrist for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression: 26.4 (23.9) (Supplementary Table  ). We were unable to calculate conditional   F  -statistics to assess the strength of our multivariable instruments: SVMR statistical methods recently extended by Sanderson et al.  to two-sample MVMR are appropriate only for non-overlapping exposure summary-level data sources; when overlapping, the requisite pairwise covariances between SNP associations are determinable only using individual-level data. \n\n\n### Sample independence \n  \nParticipant overlap in samples used to estimate genetic associations between exposure and outcome in two-sample MR can bias results , so we endeavored to minimize overlap to reduce this source of weak instrument bias. In this study, exposure and outcomes were derived from non-overlapping samples. Exposures, however, were, derived from overlapping UKBB-based samples. As regards potential biases arising from participant overlap in samples used to construct the multivariable instrument sets, we are unaware of any tests to assess weak instrument bias arising therefrom, however, unconditional single variable and conditional multivariable   F  -statistics assessing the strength of the instruments may be used to indicate any overall weak instrument bias. We calculated unconditional SVMR instrument   F-  statistics, all of which exceeded the rule-of-thumb   F  \u2009>\u200910, but, as described above, we are not able to calculate conditional MVMR instrument   F-  statistics. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nFor SVMR, applied to assess the total effects of EA and CP on the risk of suicide attempt, with and without accounting for comorbid mental disorders, and vice versa, we used inverse-variance weighted MR (MR IVW) (single-variable weighted linear regression) along with the complementary MR Egger, weighted median and weighted mode methods, to assess the evidence of the causal effects of EA and CP on the risk of suicide attempt, so as to detect the sensitivity of the results to different patterns of violations of IV assumptions: consistency of results across methods strengthens an inference of causality . MR IVW is generally regarded as the main method: in the absence of pleiotropy and assuming the instruments are valid, MR IVW returns unbiased estimates of a causal effect are returned so long as horizontal pleiotropy is balanced . MR Egger extends MR IVW by not setting the intercept to zero, thus allowing the net-horizontal pleiotropic effect across all SNPs to be unbalanced or directional (i.e., some SNPs could be acting on the outcome through a pathway other than through the exposure) . MR Egger returns unbiased causal effect estimates even if the assumption of no horizontal pleiotropy is violated for all SNPs, but the estimates are less precise than MR IVW. Weighted median MR uses the median effect of all available SNPs so that only half of the SNPs need to be valid instruments (i.e., no horizontal pleiotropy, no association with confounders, and robust association with the exposure) to return an unbiased causal effect estimate. Stronger SNPs contribute more towards the causal estimate, with the contribution of each SNP weighted by the inverse variance of its association with the outcome . Weighted mode-based MR clusters the SNPs into groups based on the similarity of causal effects and returns the causal effect estimate based on the cluster that has the largest number of SNPs: unbiased causal effects so long as the SNPs within the largest cluster are valid instruments. Weighted mode MR weights each SNP\u2019s contribution to the clustering by the inverse variance of its outcome effect. Assuming the most common causal effect is consistent, the estimated causal effects would be unbiased even if all other instruments are invalid . \n\nFor MVMR, performed to assess the independent direct effects of EA and CP on the risk of suicide attempt, with and without accounting for comorbid mental disorders and other potential confounders, including household income, alcohol consumption, ever smoker status, and self-reported nerves, tension, anxiety or depression, we used the extension developed by Burgess et al.  of the IVW MR method, performing multivariable weighted linear regression (variants uncorrelated, random effect model) with the intercept term set to zero, and, additionally, the MVMR extension of the MR Egger method to correct for both measured and unmeasured pleiotropy . \n\n\n### Sensitivity analyses and diagnostics \n  \nWe used the iPsych model 2 (GWAS on suicide attempts accounting for psychiatric diagnoses) as a primary sensitivity analysis to the main model 1 findings. To evaluate heterogeneity in genetic instrument effects, indicating potential violations of the instrumental variable (IV) assumptions, we used MR Egger intercept test , the Cochran   Q   heterogeneity test , and the MR   p  leiotropy   res  idual   s  um and   o  utlier (MR-PRESSO) test . An MR Egger regression intercept is generally interpreted as the average pleiotropic effect across all instruments: MR Egger regression thus provides a test for average pleiotropy, and further has been extended to correct for both measured and unmeasured pleiotropy in MVMR . The Cochran   Q   test used to identify outliers in regression analysis generally has been applied in MR to detect average pleiotropy: pleiotropy can induce heterogeneity of individual ratio estimates . MR-PRESSO detects pleiotropic bias in MR caused by a violation of the exclusion restriction IV assumption; extending the principal of the Cochran   Q   test, MR-PRESSO provides a global test to detect pleiotropic bias and identify sources of the bias (so-called outlier SNPs), and further has been extended to detect pleiotropic bias also in MVMR . We used the MR-PRESSO global test to identify outlier SNPs; removing the outlier SNPs, we reran the MR and retested so as to determine whether removing outliers resolved the detected heterogeneity. The MVMR models accounting for psychiatric symptoms (psychotic experiences, feeling anxious and/or depressed), behaviors (alcohol consumption and smoking), and psychiatric disorders (MDD, schizophrenia, and BD) were also used as additional sensitivity analyses to evaluating the robustness of the main EA\u2013suicide findings \n\n\n### Interpretation of findings \n  \nWhile we caution against interpreting the study findings based solely on the basis of a dichotomous   P  -value threshold , we used a two-sided alpha of 0.025 (based upon testing EA and CP) to dichotomize \u201csignificant\u201d or not. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe generally looked for those estimates (1) substantially agreeing in direction and magnitude across complementary MR methods, (2) exceeding nominal significance in MR IVW, (3) not indicating bias from horizontal pleiotropy (MR-PRESSO global   P  \u2009>\u20090.01; and/or also MR Egger intercept   P  \u2009>\u20090.01), and, for SVMR, (4) indicating true causal effect directionality (Steiger directionality test   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). Complete MR results with test statistics are presented in Supplementary Tables  \u2013 . MR-PRESSO outlier corrected results are presented in Tables  ,   and Fig.  .   \nSingle-variable and multivariable inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomization associations between educational attainment and cognitive performance on risk of suicide attempt in individuals with and without mental disorders. \n  \nResults are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for the effect of a unit standard deviation increase in educational attainment (years of schooling: mean = 15.1, s.d.=4.2 years), a unit standard deviation increase in standardized cognitive performance score (mean 0.00, s.d. = 0.99\u20131.00), and categorical increase in average annual household income before tax, on the risk of suicide attempt (hospital recorded non-fatal suicide attempt, including secondary diagnoses of poisoning by drugs or other substances, or injuries to the hand, wrist, and forearm). Model 1 was based upon iPSYCH Suicide Attempt Risk GWAS not accounting for comorbid mental disorders (  N  \u2009=\u200950,260); model 2 was based upon iPSYCH Suicide Attempt Risk GWAS accounting for diagnosed comorbid mental disorders in the same cohort sample (  N  \u2009=\u200950,260): schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, affective disorders, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia, and \u201cany other disorder\u201d. (1) SVMR results show effects of exposures on outcomes analyzed separately: the estimates are considered to be the total effect (direct plus indirect effect) of the exposure on the outcome; (2) MVMR results show effects of EA and CP analyzed simultaneously: the estimates are interpreted as the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome, independent of the effect of the other exposure; (3) MVMR adjusting for Average Household Income (Before Tax) showing effects of EA, CP and AHI analyzed simultaneously. All results shown are pruned of variants identified as outliers by the MR-PRESSO test (MR-PRESSO   P  \u2009<\u20090.10). Cochran   Q   tests did not indicate heterogeneity and MR Egger intercept test did not indicate pleiotropy for any model.

Model 1 was based upon iPSYCH Suicide Attempt Risk GWAS not accounting for diagnosed comorbid mental disorders (  N  \u2009=\u200950,260); model 2 was based upon iPSYCH Suicide Attempt Risk GWAS accounting for diagnosed comorbid mental disorders in same cohort sample (  N  \u2009=\u200950,260): schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, affective disorders, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia, and \u201cany other disorder\u201d. (1) SVMR results show effects of additional exposures on outcomes analyzed separately: the estimates are considered to be the total effect (direct plus indirect effect) of the exposure on the outcome; (2) MVMR results adjusting for additional exposures show effects of EA analyzed simultaneously with additional exposure (and combinations of exposures): the estimates are interpreted as the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome, independent of the effect of the other exposure. All results shown are pruned of variants identified as outliers by the MR-PRESSO test (MR-PRESSO   P  \u2009<\u20090.10). Cochran   Q   tests did not indicate heterogeneity (except as otherwise noted in the text) and MR Egger intercept test did not indicate pleiotropy for any model.

We found genetic variants associated with increased EA, not controlling/adjusting for CP, associated with decreased risk of suicide attempt (OR per unit standard deviation increase in EA, 0.524, 95% CI, 0.412\u20130.666,   P  \u2009=\u20091.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ), and genetic variants associated with increased CP, not controlling/adjusting for EA, also associated with decreased risk of suicide attempt (OR per unit standard deviation increase in standardized score, 0.714, 95% CI, 0.577\u20130.885,   P  \u2009=\u20090.002). Accounting for comorbid mental disorders using the SA model 2 GWAS, we found associations of greater magnitude than in model 1 but less precision for both EA (model 2 OR, 0.687, 95% CI, 0.577\u20130.885,   P  \u2009=\u20090.002) and CP (model 2 OR, 0.794, 95% CI, 0.636\u20130.990,   P  \u2009=\u20090.040) (Table  , lines 1, 2). Conversely, we found no evidence of bidirectionality: genetic variants associated with risk of suicide attempt (with and without accounting for comorbid psychiatric disorders) were not found to be associated with EA (OR 0.996, 95% CI, 0.984\u20131.007,   P  \u2009=\u20090.463) or CP (OR 1.003, 95% CI 0.983\u20131.023,   P  \u2009=\u20090.758) (Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n### Independent effects of educational attainment and cognitive performance \n  \nUsing MVMR to simultaneously assess the direct/ independent effects of each of EA and CP by controlling for the other, we found increased EA still associated, after controlling/adjusting for CP, with decreased risk of suicide attempt, with a greater magnitude for the point estimate of the direct effect but within the 95% confidence interval of the total effect estimate (OR, 0.450, 95% CI, 0.314\u20130.644,   P  \u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). Conversely, controlling/adjusting for EA, we found CP no longer associated with the risk of suicide attempt (OR, 1.044, 95% CI, 0.764\u20131.426,   P  \u2009=\u20090.786). Adjusting further for income, we found increased EA still associated with decreased risk of suicide attempt: the direct effect was greater (lower OR), and no longer within the 95% confidence interval of the total effect estimate (OR, 0.342, 95% CI, 0.206\u20130.568,   P  \u2009=\u20091.61\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ); we found CP still no longer associated directly with the risk of suicide attempt (OR, 1.182, 95% CI, 0.842\u20131.659,   P  \u2009=\u20090.333) (Fig.  ; Table  , lines 3\u20134, compared to lines 1\u20132; also Supplementary Table  ). \n\nAccounting for comorbid mental disorders using the SA model 2 GWAS, as well as controlling for income via MVMR, we found increased EA still significantly associated with decreased risk of suicide attempt, but to a lesser extent and precision than found using model 1 (model 2 OR, 0.556, 95% CI, 0.388\u20130.796,   P  \u2009<\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). CP, when adjusting for EA, was still no longer significant (model 2 OR, 1.143, 95% CI, 0.803\u20131.627,   P  \u2009=\u20090.475) (Table  , lines 6\u20137 and Supplementary Table  ). \n\nControlling for alcohol consumption and smoking behaviors, we found the effects of genetic variants associated with increased EA to be robust to the inclusion of genetic variants for these potential confounders (OR, 0.500, 95% CI, 0.389\u20130.642,   P  \u2009=\u20091.42\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ), albeit with residual heterogeneity (Table  , also Supplementary Table  ). Additionally, accounting for comorbid mental disorders using the SA model 2 GWAS, as well as alcohol consumption and smoking behaviors, we found increased EA still significantly associated with decreased suicide attempt again to a lesser extent and precision than found using model 1 (model 2 OR, 0.640, 95% CI, 0.502\u20130.816,   P  \u2009<\u20094.02\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). \n\nEven controlling for having seen a GP or psychiatrist for symptoms of \u201cnerves, tension, anxiety, or depression,\u201d in addition to alcohol consumption and smoking behaviors (as opposed to using the SA model 2 GWAS, which included incidence of comorbid severe mental disorders among the participants in the GWAS regression), we again found the effects of genetic variants associated with increased EA to be broadly consistent and robust to the inclusion of these potential confounders (OR, 0.545, 95% CI, 0.425\u20130.699,   P  \u2009=\u20093.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , controlling for ever having seen a GP for nerves, tension, anxiety or depression; OR, 0.541, 95% CI, 0.421\u20130.696,   P  \u2009=\u20092.84\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , controlling for ever having seen a psychiatrist, etc.) (Table   and Supplementary Table  ). Further, in supplemental analysis, controlling for any psychotic experiences (PE), MDD, schizophrenia, and BD, genetic variants associated with increased EA were similarly found to be broadly consistent and robust (any psychotic experiences, OR, 0.468, 95% CI, 0.376\u20130.583,   P  \u2009=\u20091.14\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , controlling for PE; OR, 0.746, 95% CI, 0.578\u20130.963,   P  \u2009=\u20090.024,   P  \u2009=\u20091.66\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , MDD; OR, 0.631, 95% CI, 0.492\u20130.811, schizophrenia; and OR, 0.685, 95% CI, 0.541\u20130.867\u2009  P  \u2009=\u20093.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , BD) (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nAs regards the potential confounders, we found associations of genetic variants associated with the incidence of smoking behaviors and nerves, tension, anxiety or depression on risk of suicide attempt, when analyzed separately in SVMR (Table   and Supplementary Table  ). When analyzed in combination in MVMR, only the variants associated with the incidence of smoking behaviors remained significantly associated with risk of suicide attempt (OR, 5.155 per unit increase in log odds of ever smoking, 95% CI, 1.707\u201315.571,   P  \u2009=\u20094.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ). \n\nThe MR-PRESSO global tests and Cochran   Q   tests did not indicate heterogeneity, nor did the MR Egger intercepts indicate directional pleiotropy in any of the analyses, after outliers identified by MR-PRESSO were removed as sources of potential pleiotropy (Supplementary Tables  \u2013 ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the current study, we use various MR methods to assess the relationship between EA, CP, and risk of a suicide attempt. Our findings highlight an important possible public health benefit of increasing EA: reducing the risk of suicidal behavior. Using multivariable MR, accounting for both CP and income, we found an additional 4.2 years of EA reduces the risk for having attempted suicide suggesting a causal pathway between EA and suicide attempt that is independent of CP, or socioeconomic status, as measured by income. Further, this EA\u2013suicide relationship remained in additional analyses accounting for potential behavioral and psychiatric mediators (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, psychotic experiences, mood and anxiety symptoms, etc.), and psychiatric disorders\u2014MDD, schizophrenia, and BD. Given the robust association between suicide attempts and later completed suicide with a recent 25-year longitudinal study estimating ~5% of suicide attempters , these findings highlight an important modifiable factor to mitigate the mortality and morbidity due to suicidal behavior. \n\nNotably, the inverse relationship between CP and risk of suicide attempt found in our SVMR analysis no longer remained after accounting for EA: the relationship appears to be mediated through EA. Conversely, we found in a bidirectional analysis that the genetic liability for suicide attempts affected neither the EA nor CP outcomes, suggesting that previous conventional analyses identifying such effects were due to confounding or reverse causation. Consistent estimates of the effect of EA across complementary MR methods used to assess sensitivity to of these estimates to changes in the underlying IV assumptions strengthens our inference of causality. \n\nThis study contributes to the increasing number of MVMR studies reporting an effect of EA on health outcomes after accounting for CP , which, given the disproportionate disparity in suicide rates between individuals with a high school education or less compared to college graduates , suggests a contribution to the substantial health inequalities observed associated with differences in EA . Other study designs using innovative approaches have also found evidence for the causal effects of education on health outcomes . For example, natural experiments, like compulsory educational reforms, that take advantage of external changes that affect EA but are unrelated to health, have shown causal effects on general health outcomes , while twin design studies have found similarly strong causal effects on health outcomes  and mortality . While we were unable to assess directly which aspects of EA may be driving the identified relationship, we hypothesize aspects such as acquiring coping skills or being in a safe environment through periods of heightened suicide attempt risk (e.g., adolescence), may be important factors; however, future studies are required to elucidate specific mechanisms. \n\nIn the SVMR analysis, we found that CP reduces the risk for attempting suicide by almost 30%; however, after incorporating EA and income into a MVMR framework, CP was no longer associated with suicidal behavior, which supports previous observational literature finding that EA explains a substantial proportion of the association between CP and suicidal behavior . CP and EA are genetically correlated , and there is MR evidence supporting a bidirectional relationship between EA and CP ; however, using MVMR methods and sensitivity analyses to assess for possible pleiotropy, we were able to extricate their independent effects on the risk for having attempted suicide, which is critical when considering policies aimed at preventing suicide. Further, given that it has been shown that many individuals who die by suicide are never seen by health care professionals , other added benefits of increased EA include using schools as ideal settings for therapeutic interventions including dialectical and cognitive-behavioral therapies . \n\nWhile MR does not elucidate the pathways between environmental exposures and outcomes , we included in supplementary MVMR analyses potential variables that may mediate the relationship between EA and suicide attempt (i.e., economic, health-behavioral (psychiatric disorders; feeling tense, anxious, or depressed; tobacco smoking; and alcohol consumption). For example, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption maybe some of the many possible health-behavioral pathways linking EA and suicide attempts . We recently reported an MR study that found evidence EA causally impacts drinking patterns and the risk for alcohol dependence (AD) with increased EA reducing the frequency of binge drinking six or more drinks per occasion, and the risk for AD ; in this study, the effect of EA remained significant after accounting for tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and other associated psychiatric risk factors, suggesting prevention strategies aimed at improving EA may have a direct effect at reducing the risk for a suicide attempt. Differences in the prevalence of risk factors like alcohol consumption likely work in combination with, for example, limitations in access and differences in the ability to benefit from health care and medical information to contribute to the widening educational gradient in mortality . \n\nIn addition, our polygenic instrument for EA may reflect both a biological mechanism (encoding characteristics that may increase EA) and social history (people from families with high EA may also have similar genetics)  and as suicidal behavior is highly familial, and may be transmitted independently from psychiatric disorders , it is possible an EA-associated influence on parental behavior may affect the child\u2019s early developmental environments that may impact suicidal behavior later in life. While we were unable to evaluate the effect of familial EA on offspring suicide behavior because the summary-level data is not available, it has been shown by comparing polygenic scores for EA that maternal EA-linked genetics predict the child\u2019s attainment better than the child\u2019s own EA polygenic score  suggesting it is plausible that the parental EA-genetics may also influence their child\u2019s suicide propensity through environmental mechanisms. \n\nFinally, while EA is\u2014in addition to being influenced by environmental factors\u2014polygenic , the biological pathways through which the genetic variants comprising our genetic EA instrument impact EA is largely unknown . However, the SNPs included in the instrument have been shown to be associated with several processes involved in early brain development including chromatin modification and transcription; post-translational regulations of gene expression, the formation of axons, dendrites, and synapses (which was also enriched in the CP instrument SNPs); and transmembrane transport of ions and solutes \u2013 including receptors for dopamine and serotonin . Notably, altered synaptic plasticity, which may impact an individual\u2019s ability to make appropriate adaptive responses to changing environmental stimuli, has been linked with suicidal behavior , while dysregulated dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission have been associated with suicide ideation, attempts, and completions in several cohorts , which together suggest potentially shared underlying biological mechanisms through which the genes associated with increased EA may impact suicide behavior. \n\n\n## Strengths and limitations \n  \nThere are notable strengths of the current study, including the use of multiple MR sensitivity analyses (Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR) that each accommodates different assumptions about genetic pleiotropy to test the robustness of the IVW estimate . In addition, the GWAS summary statistics of suicide attempt risk employed as our outcome are based on hospital records, which, unlike self-reported suicidal behavior, are not likely to be prone to social-desirability and recall biases . Similarly, while 90% of those attempting suicide have at least one psychiatric disorder , our analyses included examining the relationship between EA and suicide attempt using models accounting for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders , and additional MVMR analyses accounting for MDD, schizophrenia, and psychotic experiences, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other adverse behaviors (alcohol consumption and smoking) potentially involved in the EA\u2013suicide relationship, which both act a sensitivity analyses and improves the generalizability of the main findings. \n\nInterpreting the results of this study requires an understanding of its limitations. First, we would like to emphasize the included datasets were of white individuals of primarily European ancestry, and therefore it is important to note that these results may not generalize to other ethnic and racial populations. For example, Bridge et al.  found strong evidence for a racial disparity in childhood suicide rates with black children two-times more likely to commit suicide than white children. It was also recently shown that EA protected non-Hispanic Whites, but not non-Hispanic Blacks against future suicide attempts and deaths . Therefore, it will be necessary to examine the EA\u2013suicide relationship in relationship in populations of different ethnicities. In addition, participants in the UK Biobank have been shown to be more educated, lead healthier lifestyles, and have fewer health problems than the general UK population . Further, the nature of suicidality makes studying suicidal behavior difficult , and while suicide attempts are strong predictors of later suicide completions\u201425% of those dying by suicide have a failed attempt within the year prior to completion \u2014we were unable to differentiate between violent and non-violent suicide attempts, which confer different risks for later completions . \n\nThe underlying biological mechanisms through which the instrument SNPs impact EA and the other included variables remain largely unknown; however, some of the variants are located in genomic regions regulating brain development and expressed in the neural tissue and the central nervous system throughout development and the lifespan . GWS (  P  -value < 5 \u00d7\u200910 ) SNPs for each included trait explains only a small proportion of its total variance, and while our final GWS EA and CP SNPs instruments explained ~1.7% and 2.2% of the variance in EA and CP, respectively (Supplementary Table  ), it may be overly simplistic to interpret these SNPs as representations of \u201cEA genes\u201d or \u201cCP genes\u201d due to the complex interaction with environmental factors . \n\nFurther, it is well documented that differences in EA are associated with more access and utilization of health care, prevention, and treatment , which given the strong correlation between suicide rates with indicators of health care access  suggests a potential mechanism through which EA may affect suicidal behavior. However, EA retained a robust, potentially causal, relationship with suicide attempt notwithstanding the inclusion of genetic instruments accounting for having seen a GP or psychiatrist for symptoms of \u201cnerves, tension, anxiety, or depression.\u201d \n\nWhile MVMR enables the simultaneous assessment of the effects of two or more exposures, other horizontal pleiotropy pathways, like personality traits, may still bias the estimates . However, using different sensitivity analyses that have orthogonal assumptions to test for potential pleiotropy , we found similar estimates across the methods. Next, it has been shown that genetic variants associated with EA are also linked with family background and parental EA  suggesting that residual population stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects\u2014where parental EA and CP affect the life outcomes of their offspring\u2014could potentially explain these findings. Also, our EA instrument only evaluated the number of years of schooling at academic institutions, so resolving which aspects of education, or even how skills and values learned outside of formal academic training, impact suicide attempt risk will need to be evaluated by future studies. Similarly, CP represents an amalgamation of functions responsible for perception, thought, action, and emotion , which might explain different aspects of the progression from suicidal ideation to attempts to completion . Therefore, given the complexity of CP  and the possible differential effects of various components of CP have on suicide risk, the verbal-numerical attainment and neuropsychological tests used to generate the CP outcome in the Lee et al. GWAS is insufficient to elucidate these differences. Therefore, future studies disentangling the role of distinct aspects of CP in suicidal behavior are necessary. \n\nFurther still, we were unable to distinguish the effects of gender as gender-specific suicide attempt GWASs are not yet available. However, gender is a well-known risk factor for suicide with females both demonstrating higher rates of non-fatal suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide ideation) and attempt suicide more frequently than males . Conversely, males have been shown to have a higher rate of suicide completions  and to use more violent and lethal methods . It has been suggested that traditional gender roles may explain, in part, the observed gender differences in suicidal behavior . For example, gender roles may reduce the likelihood of males to seek help for suicidal ideation or depression , especially during times of economic stress where traditional gender roles may be impacted by societal expectations for males to provide for themselves and their family . Similarly, while females are more likely to maintain social and family connections that may provide needed support during times of increased suicide risk , the stigma associated with infertility or having children outside of marriage have been linked with increased suicidal behavior among women . Since the summary association data used in this study included gender and age as covariates in the GWAS models, the outcome phenotype would be interpreted as risk of suicide attempt controlling for gender; however, future MR studies should investigate the EA\u2013SA relationship when sex-specific suicide GWAS data becomes available. \n\nFinally, the iPSYCH GWASs in the sample was constructed from a cohort of 1,472,762 singletons born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005, which resulted in an age-related breakdown of the 6024 included cases were as follows: 15\u201319 years (17.9%), 20\u201324 years (37.2%), 25\u201329 years (35.6%), and 30\u201334 years (9.4%) . Suicidal behavior\u2014and its predominant risk factors\u2014is not constant over the life course  and since the oldest iPSYCH participants were aged 34 years, we were unable to assess possible temporal components to our findings. In addition, we were unable to assess suicidal behavior within the ideation-to-action framework, where suicidal ideation and the progression from ideation to attempts are postulated to be distinct phenomena with unique predictors , which makes future MR studies using GWASs that differentiate both have extended suicide behavior across the life course and differentiate between ideation and attempts necessary when the data becomes available. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur analyses align with previous observational studies which suggest that EA causally diminishes the risk for suicide attempts among white individuals of European ancestry, while the negative effect of CP on the risk of suicide attempts may be mediated through the effect of CP on EA. In conjunction with the growing number of MVMR studies to identify a direct effect of EA after accounting for CP on various physical and psychiatric outcomes, our findings suggest that targeted prevention programs that increase EA may be useful to reduce the mortality due to suicide; however, future MR studies examining the EA\u2013suicide relationship in other racial and ethnic populations are necessary. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7653915, "text_md5": "da785a69a5a438d6b58f4e7c32d00185", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 110], "journal": [111, 128], "publication_year": [130, 134], "title": [145, 386], "keywords": [400, 430], "abstract": [443, 2582], "body": [2591, 57692]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33168806, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-020-01047-2", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653915", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7653915"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653915\">7653915</a>", "list_title": "PMC7653915  Educational attainment reduces the risk of suicide attempt among individuals with and without psychiatric disorders independent of cognition: a bidirectional and multivariable Mendelian randomization study with more than 815,000 participants"}

We describe the changes of the WBC lineages in pediatric endogenous hypercortisolemia, their associations with the markers of disease severity, and the presence of infections. \n\n\n## Study design \n  \nWe identified 197 children with endogenous CS. Clinical and biochemical data were recorded. Sixty-six children with similar age and gender, and normocortisolemia served as controls. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe absolute lymphocyte count of CS patients was significantly lower than that of controls, while the total WBC and the absolute neutrophil counts were significantly higher. These changes correlated with several markers of CS severity and improved after resolution of hypercortisolemia. Infections were identified in 35 patients (17.8%), and their presence correlated to elevated serum morning cortisol, midnight cortisol, and urinary free cortisol levels, as well as with the decrease in absolute lymphocyte count. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nChildren with endogenous CS have abnormal WBC counts, which correlate with the severity of CS, and normalize after cure. Infections are common in this population; clinicians should be aware of this complication of CS and have low threshold in diagnosis and treating infections in CS. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince 1948, when glucocorticoids (GCs) were first used for the management of rheumatoid arthritis, pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids have been widely prescribed for their immunosuppressive properties.( ,  ) GCs currently constitute the first line therapy for many autoimmune, allergic, and malignant disorders, both in adults and in children.( ) \n\nGCs exert various effects on the immune system, affecting both the cellular components as well as the proteins of the inflammatory pathway.( ) Specifically, GCs may alter the number of the white blood cells, resulting in leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia as well as their function, leading to decreased activity of the natural killer cells.( \u2013 ) At the same time they also affect the concentration of the pro-inflammatory proteins, leading to the decrease of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL1, and IFN\u03b3. ( ) \n\nMost of these effects have been reported in animal models or cell lines, while the human studies of the effects of GCs usually involve patients with additional underlying diseases. Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) may serve as a model of the net effects of GCs on the human body, and indeed adult patients with endogenous CS have been previously studied regarding the effects of hypercortisolemia on their immune system.( ,  ) Endogenous CS leads to a significant increase in the WBC and the neutrophil counts, and decrease of the lymphocyte count.( ) As a result, increased susceptibility to infections has been identified as one of the major morbidity and mortality factors in hypercortisolemic patients.( ) The significance of this finding is highlighted in the endocrine society guidelines for the management of CS, where a recommendation for prophylactic antibiotic use in the adult patients with urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels greater than 5 fold the upper normal limit is included.( ) \n\nDespite these recommendations in adults with CS, no prior study has described the changes of the immune system in the pediatric CS population. We here aimed to describe these changes in a large cohort of pediatric patients with endogenous CS. We also investigated the presence of infections and their correlation with markers of severity of hypercortisolemia. \n\n\n## Subjects and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThrough a retrospective chart review, we identified 197 patients diagnosed from 1998 until 2017 with endogenous CS before the age of 18 years old. The patients were evaluated at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes Health (NIH) under the protocols 97-CH-0076, 95-CH-0059 and 00-CH-0160. Our research was approved by the   Eunice Kennedy Shriver   National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the minor patients, and assent from the minor patients. \n\nThe diagnosis of CS and the classification of the various etiologies was based on previously described criteria.( ) The diagnosis was confirmed histologically after surgery for all patients that underwent surgical resection. For two of the patients with Cushing disease (CD), who underwent surgical treatment at an outside institution, review of the pathology report confirmed the presence of a corticotroph adenoma. Of the 38 patients with CS due to adrenal causes, 17 patients had confirmed clinical and genetic diagnosis of Carney Complex syndrome, while of the patients with CD, two patients had Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome type 1, and one patient had tuberous sclerosis. \n\nSixty-six children, with similar age and gender distribution as our patient cohort, who were referred to our institution for evaluation of possible hypercortisolemia and were found to have normal cortisol secretion, served as the control group. Most of these patients were obese, while some of them had additional pathologic disorders identified: diabetes insipidus (n=1), connexin 26 defect and deafness (n=1), fragile X (n=1), hypothyroidism, on replacement therapy and biochemically euthyroid at the time of the test, (n=2), MEN syndrome type 1 (n=1), developmental delay and learning difficulties (n=2), Kallman syndrome (n=1), precocious puberty (n=1), and premature adrenarche (n=1). \n\nDemographic (age, gender, duration of disease), clinical (operation notes, pathology reports, presence of infection), hematology and biochemical data (CBC with differential, serum and urine cortisol, plasma ACTH) were retrieved from the electronic medical record system. The first CBC with differential at the time of diagnosis was used for further analysis. The results from the CBC with differential done at the follow up visit closest to 1 year after treatment were used for the analysis after cure (mean time to follow up visit 14.1 \u00b1 11.6 months). Serum cortisol and UFC results were documented for all the patients at the follow up visit to document the resolution of hypercortisolemia. \n\nThe average of the first three urinary free cortisol levels was calculated and is referred to as UFC. Urinary samples that were collected on days of additional tests, such as dexamethasone suppression test, were excluded. Morning cortisol refers to the average value of the 7:30am and 8:00am samples of serum cortisol, while midnight cortisol refers to the average value of the serum cortisol at 11:30pm and 12:00am. Plasma ACTH refers to the average value of 7:30am and 8:00am levels if available, or the plasma ACTH level collected closer to 8:00am. \n\n\n### CBC, serum and urine markers of CS \n  \nCBC with differential was measured using the Sysmex XN 3000 automated hematology system (Lincolnshire, IL). The serum cortisol was measured via Solid-phase, competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay on Siemens Immulite 2500 analyzer, (Malvern, PA). UFC (average of the first three samples collected after admission) was measured in 24-hour urine collections via High Performance Liquid Chromatography/ Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The plasma ACTH was measured via chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay on Siemens Immulite 200 XPi analyzer (Malvern, PA). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe results are presented as frequencies and percentages, and mean (\u00b1 standard deviation, SD). Data were assessed for distributional normality, and non-parametric tests were used for non-normally distributed data. Continuous data were compared between groups (e.g., CS vs controls; CS with infection vs CS without infection) using the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as applicable; paired continuous data (e.g., diagnosis vs cure) were compared using the one-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Categorical data between groups were compared by means of the \u03c7  or Fisher\u2019s exact tests, as appropriate, and paired data were compared using the McNemar\u2019s test. Correlation analyses utilized the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient. Data were considered statistically significant if the resulting p value was < 0.05. Analyses were carried out using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of the patients \n  \nThe clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients are shown in  . The mean age at presentation was 12.5 years, with a range from 2.7 to 18 years of age. There were more female than male patients (n = 109, 55.3%). In the control group, there were 66 individuals, with mean age of 12.5 years (range 2.9 to 17.9 years), and 37 (56%) females. The mean duration of disease was 2.6 \u00b1 1.8 years. At diagnosis, the mean morning serum cortisol level was 20.4 \u00b1 13.5 mcg/dL, the mean midnight serum cortisol level was 18.6 \u00b1 13.2 mcg/dL, and the mean UFC level was 399 \u00b1 1465 mcg/24H. Most of the patients were diagnosed with CD (n = 154, 78.2%), while 38 patients (19.3%) had ACTH-independent CS due to adrenal causes, and 5 patients (2.5%) were diagnosed with CS due to ectopic ACTH production, which is consistent with the previously described relative frequency of the various etiologies of CS in children. \n\nAll the patients with CD underwent transphenoidal resection (TSS), while the patients with adrenal dependent CS underwent unilateral (n = 10) or bilateral (n = 28) adrenalectomy according to their underlying disease. Of the 5 patients with ectopic CS, previously reported in a separate case series( ), all patients underwent resection of the source of ectopic ACTH/CRH production (bronchogenic carcinoma = 1, metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor = 2, thymic carcinoid = 1, metastatic hepatic neuroendocrine tumor = 1), while additional therapeutic interventions were implemented depending on the persistence of their disease. Of the patients who were followed after surgery (n = 163, 82.7%), 142 patients (87.1%) had persistent remission of CS at their latest follow up, 13 patients (8.0%) had recurrence of CS after initial remission, and 8 patients (4.9%) were not cured after surgery, resulting in a total of 21 patients (12.9%) with persistent or recurrent hypercortisolemia during any follow up ( ). \n\n\n### Comparison of the total WBC count and the various cellular components of the immune system between the patients with CS and the control group \n  \nThe total WBC count and the count of the various WBC types of the children with CS were significantly different from the corresponding values of the control group. The patients with CS had significantly lower absolute lymphocyte count (2.19 \u00b1 0.78 K/mcL) compared to the control group (2.55 \u00b1 0.84 K/mcL, p = 0.002). Additionally, they had significantly higher total white blood cell count (9.64 \u00b1 2.84 K/mcL vs 7.62 \u00b1 1.78 K/mcL, p < 0.001) and absolute neutrophil count (6.42 \u00b1 2.57 K/mcL, \u00b1 2.57, vs 4.22 \u00b1 1.43, p < 0.001) compared to the control group. When taking into account the age and gender specific normative cut-off values, 6.1 % of our patients were lymphopenic at diagnosis compared to 1.5 % of the control group (not statistically significant, p = 0.19), while leukocytosis and neutrophilia were more prevalent in the CS population (45.7 % and 34.7 %, respectively) compared to the control population (18.2 % and 9.1 %, respectively p < 0.001 for both). \n\n\n### Comparison of cellular components of the immune system before and after resolution of hypercortisolemia \n  \nFor the patients who were followed after surgery (n = 163), total WBC count was available for 136 patients while complete CBC with differential was available for 126 of them. Comparison of the WBC count and the count of the various WBC types before treatment and after resolution of hypercortisolemia revealed significant improvement of all the WBC lineages. Specifically, the absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly from 2.15 \u00b1 0.78 K/mcL at diagnosis to 2.88 \u00b1 1.04 K/mcL after cure (p < 0.001). The total white blood cell count decreased from 9.31 \u00b1 2.55 K/mcL at diagnosis to 6.83 \u00b1 1.88 K/mcL after cure (p < 0.001), while the absolute neutrophil count decreased from 6.16 \u00b1 2.34 K/mcL at diagnosis to 3.25 \u00b1 1.5 K/mcL after cure (p < 0.001) ( ). When taking into account the age and gender specific normative cut-off values, most patients with abnormal counts at diagnosis subsequently normalized at their follow-up visit [90.0% with previous lymphopenia (p = 0.035), 91.1 % with leukocytosis (p < 0.001), and 86.8% with neutrophilia (p < 0.001) normalized]. When studying specifically the patients who had persistent or recurrent disease, the various counts showed temporary improvements at the period of remission of CS, with recurrence of several of the changes upon return of hypercortisolemia, as described in  . \n\n\n### Correlation of the WBC changes with the markers of CS severity \n  \nSeveral makers of Cushing severity, including the urinary free cortisol (UFC), the morning serum cortisol and the midnight serum cortisol, correlated with alterations of the WBC and the WBC types at diagnosis. Specifically, the absolute lymphocyte count was negatively correlated with the morning and midnight cortisol levels (r  = \u22120.21, p = 0.004 and r  = \u22120.18, p = 0.011, respectively) and the UFC (r  = \u22120.16, p = 0.026). Conversely, the absolute neutrophil and the total WBC counts were positively correlated with some of the above markers ( ). When investigating specifically the patients with CD, the level of morning plasma ACTH was not related to immune cell counts (p > 0.05 in all correlation analyses with the total WBC, absolute lymphocyte, and absolute neutrophil count). Although there were few patients with significantly elevated cortisol levels that could potentially influence the statistical analyses, the results remained significant for all the above analyses after excluding them. \n\n\n### Presence of infections in children with endogenous CS \n  \nIn order to assess the clinically significant outcome of the above changes, we identified the patients who had reported a significant infection (prolonged duration, persistent after one course of treatment, or opportunistic infections) within the 6 months prior to diagnosis, or perioperatively. We identified 35 patients (17.8%) who fulfilled the above criterion. Most of the infections were fungal infections of the skin and mucosa. Specifically, 24/35 patients had evidence or history of prolonged fungal infections (tinea corporis, tinea capitis, tinea pedis or vaginal candidiasis). In addition, bacterial and viral skin infections, sinusitis, urinary tract, IV line, and GI infections were also reported. Notably, we did not identify any opportunistic infections or any case of sepsis in our cohort. \n\n\n### Correlation of WBC changes with infections and severity of CS \n  \nThere were remarkable differences between the group of CS patients with a concurrent infection and the remaining patients with CS. Specifically regarding the CBC changes, the absolute lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the group of patients with infection (2.01 \u00b1 0.93 K/mcL) compared to those without (2.24 \u00b1 0.74 K/mcL, p = 0.047). Additionally, the patients with infection had significantly higher serum morning cortisol (24.4 \u00b1 13.9 mcg/dL, vs 19.6 \u00b1 13.3 mcg/dL, p = 0.008), midnight cortisol (23.3 \u00b1 14.7 mcg/dL, vs 17.6 \u00b1 12.6 mcg/dL p = 0.005), and UFC levels (426 \u00b1 487.5 mcg/24H, vs 393 \u00b1 1603.4 mcg/24H, p = 0.009) ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe report for the first time that children with endogenous hypercortisolemia have significant changes in the cells of their immune system, including decreases of the absolute lymphocyte count and an increase of the total WBC and the absolute neutrophil count, which correlate with the serum and urine cortisol levels. The WBC count changes normalize after the resolution of hypercortisolemia, and return upon recurrence of the CS. We also demonstrate that the presence of infections, as the clinically significant outcome of these changes of the immune system, is significantly associated with the changes of the WBC counts and the indices of severity of CS. \n\nChildren with endogenous CS may be considered as the human model of the net effect of pharmacologic doses of GCs on the immune system. Several of the previous studies have described these effects in patients receiving GCs secondary to an underlying disease, such as an autoimmune, malignant, or atopic disorder.( \u2013 ) However, these patients may already have a dysregulation of their immune system and are frequently on multiple other therapeutic agents. Furthermore, the alterations of the immune system in endogenous CS have only been studied in the adult population, where additional age related illnesses may often be present.( ,  \u2013 ) On the contrary, children with endogenous hypercortisolemia, rarely have other comorbidities; thus, it is highly possible that the identified changes are the direct effect of the glucocorticoid excess. Children also exhibit continuous growth with increased plasticity, and the information that we get from diseases that present in this age could provide indirect insight on the adaptation of their immune system. \n\nGiven the high prevalence of childhood obesity, where almost one third of children and adolescents currently fall under the category of overweight or obese, it is of utmost importance to emphasize the signs that can be used by physicians to distinguish those individuals who require further workup for CS. ( ) One of the main findings of pediatric CS is the evidence of weight gain with concomitant height deceleration, which is not present in growing obese patient where height acceleration and tall stature are usually observed.( ,  ) However, other typical findings of CS, such as striae, hirsutism, acne, acanthosis nigricans, myopathy, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and decreased bone mineral density, can sometimes be also seen in obese patients or they develop over a prolonged period of hypercortisolemia, when complications have already occurred or treatment becomes challenging.( ,  \u2013 ) Although we cannot conclude anything about the timing of the CBC changes from our study (since the CBC we analyzed here was obtained after an estimated mean duration of disease of 2.6 years), it has been previously described that the changes of the WBC counts occur soon after the administration of GCs.( ,  ,  ) Thus CBC with differential, which is a low cost, minimally invasive and easy to interpret test, could potentially serve as a screening tool for CS in this population, although in the setting of an infection this should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical signs. A new study ought to look at the timing of this change and see if this test could serve for ruling in or out CS among children with obesity. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of a persistent or difficult to treat infection should prompt further workup for hypercortisolemia in suspicious patients. It is described in the literature that CS is associated with increased risk of infections.( ) In a metanalysis by Stuck   et al  , administration of GCs resulted in increased risk of infections in a dose dependent pattern.( ) Increased infection risk has been also identified as a feature of adults with endogenous CS.( ) ( ) In the pediatric population, we confirmed the high frequency of infections; thus, the presence of an abnormal CBC, with low lymphocytes and high neutrophils, and the identification of a persistent infection in an obese child should indicate the need for further evaluation. \n\nHowever, the majority of the infections in our cohort were mild, mostly fungal skin or mucosal infections, while invasive or opportunistic infections were not noted to have occurred. As we described, the presence of infection is positively associated with the serum and urinary cortisol levels. Given the rarity of ectopic CS in childhood, which is known to result in significant hypercortisolemia, the lower expected blood and urine levels of cortisol could potentially explain the milder nature of the reported infections. This is in accordance with the adult population studies, where many of the severe infections have been described in patients with ectopic/paraneoplastic CS.( ,  \u2013 ) However, this cannot exclude the possibility of a severe infection even in the pediatric population. Indeed, as previously reported by Gkourogianni   et al  , pediatric CS is a potentially fatal condition. Of the four deaths reported in that study, at least two of them were attributed to severe infections.( ) \n\nThe resolution of the WBC lineage changes after treatment of CS is also important for the follow up and counseling of the patients. Although there are reports of continuous immune dysregulation, even after normalization of the cortisol levels, most of the previous studies have documented a rebound reactivation of the immune system, presenting for example with an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases.( ,  ) \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the WBC changes in pediatric patients with endogenous CS. One of the main strengths of the study is the large number of patients included, especially when considering the rare nature of the disease, since we serve as an international center for management of pediatric pituitary tumors. We were also able to follow most of the patients longitudinally after treatment, and thus document the improvement of the cells of the immune system after cure. A limitation of the study is the retrospective nature of the investigation. Thus, since the timing of the collection of the CBC at the time of diagnosis and at the follow up was indicated by our protocol, it cannot be informative for the specific timing of the various WBC changes or their resolution. Furthermore, we relied on the review of the medical records to document the history of infections, which may be underestimated. Additionally, blood samples were not available to perform further diagnostic tests, such as lymphocyte phenotyping to detect the specific lymphocyte subtype changes, or evaluation of other inflammatory proteins and cytokines, in order to assess the changes of the secretory function of the immune cells. As it is known that the effect of GCs is not solely the effect on the number of the WBC cells, but also and, maybe even more importantly, on their function, further studies are required to describe these changes in pediatric endogenous CS. \n\nIn conclusion, pediatric patients with CS present with significant changes of the WBC counts, including decrease of the absolute lymphocyte count, which normalize after cure and return upon recurrence. These changes correlate with the morning and midnight cortisol levels and the UFC. The patients with lower lymphocyte count and higher cortisol levels, have higher risk for infections, and although most of the infections are mild, the possibility of a life-threatening infection cannot be excluded. These findings should be considered as part of the phenotypic presentation of patients with CS and may serve as diagnostic clues when an obese patient is evaluated for an underlying pathology. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5866174, "text_md5": "24b30b6a0d269d78897a000b1c5b30df", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 194], "journal": [195, 206], "publication_year": [208, 212], "title": [223, 329], "keywords": [343, 343], "abstract": [356, 1764], "body": [1773, 23802]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 29211058, "doi": "10.1038/pr.2017.278", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866174", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5866174"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866174\">5866174</a>", "list_title": "PMC5866174  Decreased Lymphocytes and Increased Risk for Infection are Common in Endogenous Pediatric Cushing Syndrome"}
