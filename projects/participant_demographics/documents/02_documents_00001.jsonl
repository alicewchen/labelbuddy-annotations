This type of headache is characterized by an acute onset and unremitting headache lasting >3\u2009months according to the diagnostic criteria of   International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition   (ICHD\u20103).  The pain associated with NDPH lacks distinct characteristics and can manifest as migraine\u2010like, tension\u2010type\u2010like, or exhibit a combination of both features.  This disease is considered highly disabling due to its persistent headache and therapeutic refractoriness. Furthermore, it is often comorbid with sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, light\u2010headedness, concentration problems, sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling, vertigo, lethargy, and other non\u2010specific syndromes. ,   Some epidemiological evidence showed that mood disorders were more prevalent in patients with NDPH, and 65.5% of the patients had severe anxiety and 40% had severe depression.  To date, there is no defined pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of NDPH. Some studies have suggested that NDPH might be associated with viral infection, inflammatory cascade, and the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, cervical spine joint hypermobility, etc ,   On balance, it seems that most proposed pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms were somewhat speculative. Thus, NDPH remains enigmatic, and further high\u2010quality studies are needed for exploring its mechanism. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided evidence for exploring the real\u2010world brain changes in patients with NDPH. Some evidence suggested that there were abnormalities in brain function and structure in adolescents with NDPH.  Our previous studies showed that adult patients with NDPH have unique alterations in hemodynamics, regional homogeneity, multiple frequency amplitudes of low\u2010frequency fluctuation, cortical activity, and brain functional connectivity (FC) in certain brain regions. ,  ,  ,   FC is defined as the temporal coincidence of spatially distant neurophysiological events. Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore FC in headache disorders.  With the development of human brain imaging techniques, numerous studies have focused on examining alterations in higher\u2010order brain regions to understand the central representation of headache and pain. In contrast, fewer investigations have explored the function of brainstem nuclei, primarily due to considerable technical challenges. However, advancements in image analysis techniques, particularly software enabling enhanced spatial normalization of brainstem structures, have significantly improved the accuracy and feasibility of brainstem imaging. The brainstem nucleus plays an important role in central pain pathways related to primary headaches, and some evidence showed that primary headaches were specifically associated with the brainstem nuclei through many neuroimaging studies, which highlight selective brainstem activation. \n\nSo far, there were no studies have focused on the FC of brainstem subregions in patients with NDPH. To gain insights into the involvement of specific brainstem nuclei in this rare primary headache disorder, we applied seed\u2010based resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) analysis to explore FC patterns between region of interest (ROI) to whole brain voxels in patients with NDPH and to explore the correlation between these aberrant FC and clinical variables. We hypothesized that abnormal FC patterns exist in different nuclei of the brainstem in patients with NDPH and that these aberrant FC might be significantly correlated with clinical variables. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis study used a cross\u2010sectional, case\u2013control design to evaluate FC in patients with NDPH and healthy controls (HCs) from rs\u2010fMRI data. All participants involved in the registry provided informed consent after receiving comprehensive details about this study. This was a sub\u2010study of the ongoing China HeadAche DIsorders RegiStry Study (CHAIRS,   Identifier: NCT05334927). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (number: KY2022\u2010044). This study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nForty HCs and 31 patients with NDPH were enrolled in the Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to October 2022. This set of data was derived from previously published data.  Patients with NDPH were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Participants were included if they met the definition of NDPH as per the ICHD\u20103 criteria.  This was determined by the following criteria: (A) a persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C; (B) the headache characterized by a distinct and memorable onset, where the pain becoming persistent and unremitting within 24\u2009h; (C) a headache last for >3\u2009months; and (D) without better explanation by another ICHD\u20103 diagnosis; (2) the eligibility of participants for MRI scans (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant etc.); (3) none of the enrolled patients with NDPH had received prophylactic treatment for a minimum duration of 3\u2009months. Furthermore, the patients diagnosed with NDPH had no prior history of opioid use, hormonal contraceptive use, and excessive utilization of acute therapy; (4) the availability of comprehensive and complete datasets. Patients with NDPH were excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) before the scan, there were other secondary factors associated with headache; (2) patients in combination with other types of primary headache; (3) pregnancy or lactation, co\u2010morbidities with other neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or endocrine system diseases, etc.; (4) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. The inclusion criteria for HCs were (1) feasibility of MRI scanning (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant, etc.); (2) no history of neurological or other major systemic diseases; (3) those who well\u2010matched the age, gender, etc. of patients with NDPH; (4) first\u2010degree relative without headaches. The exclusion criteria for HCs were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. \n\n\n### Demographic data and neuropsychological tests \n  \nWe collected demographic data, encompassing gender, age, body mass index (BMI), as well as pertinent clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with NDPH. These characteristics consisted of age at onset, disease duration, pain intensity associated with NDPH, and the related results of neuropsychological tests. We measured the pain intensity of NDPH using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and assessed the headache's impact with the Headache Impact Test\u20106 (HIT\u20106).  Sleep quality and cognitive function were gauged via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. ,   An overall score above 7 signifies poor sleep quality, while a MoCA score below 26 points to cognitive impairment. ,   Depression and anxiety levels were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 (PHQ\u20109) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20107 (GAD\u20107), respectively, with a score of 10 indicating symptoms for both measures. ,  \n\n\n### Imaging protocols \n  \nWe conducted the MRI using a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Signa Premier, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) equipped with a 48\u2010channel head coil at the National Neurological Center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Participants were instructed to minimize head and neck movements, stay awake, relaxed, and keep their eyes closed throughout the scan. Earplugs and foam padding were used to decrease scanner noise and limit head movement. We obtained T1\u2010weighted volumetric images using an MP\u2010RAGE sequence, boasting a 1\u2010mm isotropic resolution (sagittal acquisition, field of view (FOV) of 256\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 256, 192 slices, flip angle of 8\u00b0, preparation time of 880\u2009ms, recovery time of 400\u2009ms, acceleration factor of 2, acquisition time of 4:00). Resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) data were recorded via a multi\u2010band blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) sequence, providing a 2.4\u2010mm isotropic resolution (transverse acquisition, FOV of 208\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 86, 65 slices with a multi\u2010band factor of 6, flip angle of 64\u00b0, echo time\/repetition time of 39\/1000\u2009ms, no in\u2010plane acceleration or slice gap, and 330 brain volumes). \n\n\n### Data processing and analyses \n  \nAll MRI data were processed in MATLAB 2016b utilizing both Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for rs\u2010fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA;  ). We adhered to the following data preprocessing steps: Firstly, we eliminated the initial 20 time points from each functional time course to mitigate the effect of unstable magnetization. Next, we conducted slice timing, implemented motion correction for headaches, performed spatial normalization, and executed spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum of 8\u2009mm. These procedures were executed utilizing SPM12 (FIL, London, UK). We excluded participants who exhibited head movements beyond 3\u2009mm or rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction. Co\u2010registered anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. These images were subsequently normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with a resampled voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm . Finally, we employed DPARSFA for linear trend removal and time bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to diminish the impact of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. \n\nThe FC analysis steps were as follows: Firstly, we identified 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas as seeds ( ). Secondly, FC computations of these regions were performed using SPM12. We extracted the time course of the seeds and computed FC between the seed's time course and the average time courses of the whole brain in a voxel\u2010wise manner, employing Pearson's correlation analysis. Thirdly, to enhance normality, we converted correlation coefficients to   z  \u2010values using the Fisher   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. Fourthly, we conducted a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test at the voxel level with gender and age as covariates within the brain mask. We set a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (two\u2010tailed at the voxel level) and used family\u2010wise error (FWE) correction to adjust to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at the cluster level. Lastly, we extracted the average FC values from individual significant clusters for Pearson's correlation analysis with demographic data and neuropsychological tests. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe sample size was based on the available data and previous literature.  We described normally distributed data as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and non\u2010normally distributed data as median with interquartile range. The chi\u2010square test allowed comparison of gender between patients and HCs. To compare normally distributed data across groups, we used the two\u2010sample t\u2010test, and for non\u2010normally distributed data, we applied the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations between demographic data, neuropsychological test results, and region of interest (ROI)\u2010related FC values. We set statistical significance at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, and all hypothesis tests were two\u2010tailed. All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We conducted a two\u2010sample t\u2010test at voxel level in SPM12, with gender and age as covariates, to examine FC differences between patients and HCs. For voxel\u2010based correlation analysis, we used a multiple regression model, considering age and gender as covariates or potential factors; we deemed   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 as significant, applying FWE correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 also considered significant). We implemented multiple corrections when conducting correlation analysis between FC, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological tests (employing Bonferroni correction,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00016 [0.05\/312]). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant profiles and clinical characteristics \n  \nWe prospectively recruited 31 patients with NDPH and 40 HCs. However, due to incomplete scans and excessive head movements (>3\u2009mm or maximum rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction), we excluded 2 patients with NDPH and 3 HCs. Consequently, our study comprised 29 patients with NDPH (15 males, 14 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 37.00\u2009\u00b1\u200921.06\u2009years old) and 37 HCs (16 males, 21 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 34.89\u2009\u00b1\u200910.96\u2009years old). The demographic details and clinical characteristics of the participants are depicted in Table\u00a0 . Importantly, we found no significant differences in demographic information such as age (  p  \u2009=\u20090.627), gender (  p  \u2009=\u20090.497), BMI (  p  \u2009=\u20090.077), and right\u2010handedness (  p  \u2009>\u20090.999) between the patient and HC groups. Four patients did not have HIT\u20106, PHQ\u20109, GAD\u20107, and PSQI scores and 11 patients did not have MoCA scores due to their reluctance to be assessed by the questionnaires during hospitalization and lost to follow\u2010up after discharge; thus, we excluded these patients from scale\u2010associated analysis. Of the patients included, 16 (64.0%) presented severe headache effects (HIT\u20106 score\u2009\u2265\u200956), 11 (44.0%) exhibited symptom of depression (PHQ\u20109 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 8 (32.0%) had symptom of anxiety (GAD\u20107 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 16 (64.0%) reported poor quality of sleep (PSQI score\u2009>7), and 7 (38.9%) showed cognitive impairment (MoCA score\u2009<\u200926). All participants' structural MRI scans were devoid of any irregularities. \n  \nParticipants' demographics and clinical characteristics. \n    \n\n### The   FC   of brainstem nuclei between patients and   HCs  \n  \nBased on 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas, we finally found abnormal FC in 11 seeds including right inferior medullary reticular formation (iMRt), right mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt), bilateral locus coeruleus (LC), bilateral laterodorsal tegmental nucleus\u2010central gray of the rhombencephalon (LDTg_CGPn), median raphe (MnR), left medial parabrachial nucleus (MPB), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and bilateral ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex (VTA_PBP).

(9) The FC between the PAG and bilateral pulvinar medial thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.034; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.029) were significantly increased in patients compared to HCs. In contrast, the FC between the PAG and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.003; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral insula (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral middle cingulate gyrus (Figure\u00a0  D\u2013E; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs.

No significant correlation was found between the FC and patients' clinical variables, including the disease duration, headache intensity, the score of HIT\u20106, GAD\u20107, PHQ\u20109, PSQI, MoCA after controlling age and gender (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, we applied a seed\u2010based approach to explore resting\u2010state FC of brainstem and its possible correlation to clinical variables in patients with NDPH. Interestingly, we found that patients had different brain network patterns in multiple subnuclei of brainstem. This provides us with neuroimaging evidence to elucidate the potential mechanism of this rare primary headache. \n\n### The locus coeruleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe LC serves as a prominent origin of noradrenergic projections within the central nervous system. It dispatches extensive and selective projections to various regions, including the neocortex, spinal cord, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and certain parts of the thalamus, thus supplying a significant source of noradrenaline. ,  ,   Noradrenaline acts as a powerful modulator of pain, exerting intrinsic control of pain. Besides containing noradrenaline, LC neurons also co\u2010express other neuropeptides known to be involved in headache are also expressed in the LC, including pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2010activating peptide, substance P, and neuropeptide Y, etc. ,  ,  ,  ,   Stress and emotional factors are known triggers for both pain and headache, and the LC is a key mediator of the stress response. Stress\u2010induced activation of the LC and subsequent noradrenaline release can modulate pain sensitivity. ,  ,   Current evidence also suggests that the LC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache. ,   Dysfunctions in LC activity, such as altered firing rates or abnormal release of noradrenaline, may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of headaches. ,   Above all, the locus coeruleus emerges as a critical player in the intricate network of pain and headache modulation. Our results showed that LC has reduced FC to the cerebellum, although there is no direct neural connection between the cerebellum and LC, they can influence each other indirectly through neural networks. For example, the LC regulates the brain's levels of attention and arousal by releasing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and these neurotransmitters may also affect cerebellar activity. This also prompted us to focus on the potential pathogenesis of noradrenaline nuclei in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The median raphe in headache and pain \n  \nThe median raphe is a primary source of serotonergic projections in the central nervous system, and its activation leads to the release of serotonin (5\u2010HT) throughout the brain.  It has been implicated in the regulation of pain, headache, and emotional states, playing a crucial role in the etiology and treatment of related disorders.  Furthermore, it has been proposed that the serotonin system is involved in the regulation of various behaviors, including aggression, aversive learning, impulsivity, attention, decision\u2010making, and reward.  Additionally, projections originating from the median raphe nucleus regulate dopaminergic activity in the forebrain. These projections are essential for encoding negative experiences and may have a central role in mood disorders associated with depression and anxiety. ,   NDPH is not only characterized by persistent headache symptoms but often accompanied by psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that these abnormal FC in median raphe may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDPH\u2010related pain, depression, and anxiety. \n\n\n### The   PAG   in headache and pain \n  \nThe PAG plays an important role in the endogenous pain and emotional modulatory system that it can regulate incoming nociceptive information and other kinds of signals, including cognitive behaviors, emotional states, and stress reaction. ,  ,   According to anatomy, PAG was divided into 4 functional areas: (1) dorsomedial (dmPAG); (2) dorsolateral (dlPAG); (3) lateral (lPAG); (4) ventrolateral (vlPAG). The dmPAG, lPAG, and vlPAG can project downward to the brainstem, whereas the dlPAG does not. The vlPAG receives projections from the prefrontal cortices, insula, and central nucleus of the amygdala; innervates the parasympathetic nervous system; and is involved in emotions regulation, endogenous descending pain modulatory system, and innate fear. ,  \n\nAs the largest gray matter nucleus in the diencephalon, the thalamus serves as the central hub for integrating and processing nociceptive signals.  This study showed increased FC between the PAG and pulvinar medial thalamus. The PAG receives nociceptive input signals and projects them upward to the thalamus, which processes the information and projects it to the sensory cortex to participate in pain perception.  Some evidence suggests that PAG can project substantial neurons to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and is involved in processing acute and\/or chronic stressors.  Recent studies have also shown that PKC\u2010dependent signaling pathways in the PAG and thalamus are involved in pain processing,  and reciprocal interactions in these regions may be important for pain perception. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that the cingulate gyrus exhibits specific regulatory functions in emotions, actions, and memory.  The spatial and motor\u2010related information from the parietal cortex is projected to the posterior cingulate cortex and outputted from the midcingulate motor area to the premotor area. Additionally, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in emotional processing and action, while the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory by outputting information to the hippocampus.  Our study found a significant decrease in FC between the PAG and the cingulate cortex. We believe that the dysregulation of emotional, behavioral, and memory functions in the cingulate gyrus may be one of the pathological mechanisms of abnormal emotional behavior and memory in patients with NDPH. The posterior insula receives primary interoceptive signals, and it can process low\u2010level sensory features. This information is then relayed to the anterior insula and integrated emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from cortical and subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, etc. Human behavior involves the dynamic integration of emotions, cognition, and motivation, and its dysfunction is the pathological basis of many psychiatric disorders. Substantial studies have shown that dysfunction of the insula is the common pathological basis of many psychiatric diseases.  Additionally, recent studies have shown that the insula is involved in auditory processing.  Some studies have suggested that the superior temporal gyrus is involved in the perception of emotions in response to facial stimuli and auditory processing. ,   Our results illustrated significantly decreased FC between the PAG and insula and superior temporal gyrus. In summary, we believe the dysfunction of the insula and superior temporal gyrus may reveal the cause of the emotional disorder and phonophobia in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The reticular formation in headache and pain \n  \nThe reticular formation, comprising a net\u2010like structure of brainstem nuclei and neurons, spans a wide area of the brainstem from the mesencephalon to the medulla oblongata and extends into the superior cervical spinal cord segments. It plays a pivotal role in coordinating a diverse range of reflexive and essential functions. These encompass arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm regulation, sleep\u2013wake cycles, somatic motor coordination, cardiovascular and respiratory control, pain modulation, as well as habituation. ,   Studies have shown that the reticular formation receives inputs from peripheral nociceptors and ascending pain pathways, enabling it to actively modulate incoming pain signals and activate the body's endogenous opioid system. ,  ,   This modulation can occur through inhibitory or facilitatory actions of the reticular formation on pain transmission, ultimately influencing the overall pain perception. ,   In the context of headaches, the reticular formation's connections with other regions implicated in headache pathophysiology suggest its contribution to headache generation.  Our results showed that iMRt and mRt had decreased FC with cerebellum_9 and superior temporal gyrus, respectively, which indicated that the abnormal function of reticular formation may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of NDPH. \n\n\n### The parabrachial nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe parabrachial nucleus, situated in the dorsolateral pons, encompasses the superior cerebellar peduncle as it enters the brainstem from the cerebellum. Anatomically, it comprises the medial parabrachial nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and subparabrachial nucleus. This nucleus plays a pivotal role in diverse physiological processes, including arousal, thermoregulation, and blood sugar regulation. ,  ,   Additionally, it is involved in pain modulation, including trigeminal pain.  Furthermore, the rostral region of the parabrachial nucleus establishes connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla, facilitating access to the descending pain modulatory system.  It also connects with higher subcortical structures such as the thalamus and hypothalamus for pain processing, as well as the amygdala for integration with the central autonomic network. ,   Our results showed that medial parabrachial nucleus had decreased FC with cerebellum_1 and cerebellum_2. There is substantial evidence that the cerebellum has extensive fibrous projection with parabrachial nucleus, and those projections involve in modulating classical fear conditioning. ,   However, future basic experiments are needed to verify the specific role of these related projections in headache, pain, and fear memories. \n\n\n### The ventral tegmental area in headache and pain \n  \nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA), situated near the midline on the floor of the midbrain, serves as the source of dopaminergic cell bodies for the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways. The VTA has been classified into four distinct zones or subareas by neuroscientists, namely the parabrachial pigmented area, paranigralis nucleus area, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and parafasciculus retroflexus area. The paranigral and parabrachial areas are characterized by a dense population of dopamine neurons, while the parafasciculus and rostromedial regions exhibit a lower density of dopamine neurons. On the other hand, the paranigral and parabrachial area contains large\u2010sized and separately stained tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. The VTA plays a significant role in various processes, encompassing reward cognition, which involves motivational salience, associative learning, and positive emotions.  Tamara demonstrated that reduced motivation induced by pain in rats is linked to decreased excitability and diminished activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA.  Some evidence showed glutamatergic stimulation of VTA parabrachial pigmented nucleus neurons reduced nociceptive and spontaneous trigeminocervical complex neuronal firing. \n\nThe cingulate cortex, positioned in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex, constitutes a pivotal component of the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion formation and processing, as well as learning and memory.  Given its crucial role, the cingulate cortex holds significant importance in disorders like depression and schizophrenia.  Neurons from the VTA innervate the cingulate cortex. Our results showed that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cingulate cortex. This may cause emotional and affective abnormalities in patients with NDPH. Additionally, we found decreased FC between the ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex and thalamus. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the thalamus.  These glutamatergic afferents play a critical role in modulating VTA cell firing. Activation of these neurons leads to an increase in firing rates of dopamine neurons within the VTA, inducing burst firing patterns.  The cerebellum, with its extensive projections to the brainstem, is implicated in pain processing. ,   It receives pain input through descending cortico\u2010cerebellar pathways and ascending spino\u2010cerebellar pathways involving the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Integration of this information within the cerebellum enables the transfer of relevant signals to the motor system, leading to a conscious motor response to pain that can be modulated according to pain intensity. Our results suggested that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cerebellum. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebellar pain regulation in NDPH patients need to be further studied. \n\nWe found that FC values were significantly reduced in the VTA and substantia nigra of patients with NDPH. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to different regions: the dorsolateral caudate\/putamen and the ventromedial nucleus accumbens, respectively. These projections establish the mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. Disruptions in these pathways contribute to various disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  This suggests that patients with NDPH were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities. \n\n\n### The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a significant cluster of cholinergic cells situated in the periventricular mesopontine tegmentum, sends ascending cholinergic projections through relays in the rostral thalamus and basal forebrain. These projections have been traditionally associated with promoting cortical arousal and facilitating the onset of rapid eye movement sleep. ,   Moreover, LDTg are master regulators of the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, with tonic input from LDTg being imperative for glutamate elicited burst\u2010firing activity of VTA neurons. ,   Given these central functions, prior physiological and anatomical investigations of the LDTg have primarily emphasized its connections with the thalamus, basal forebrain, and VTA\u2010nigra complex. Previous studies have shown that voluntary wheel running in mice with neuropathic pain induces exercise\u2010induced hypoalgesia, potentially through the activation of the mesolimbic reward system mediated by LDTg and lateral hypothalamic area neurons.  Positioned at the intersection of descending information from other brain areas and ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord, the cerebellum is uniquely poised to modulate and be modulated by the processing of pain. However, our results showed decreased FC values between LDTg and cerebellum in patients with NDPH, which may suggest a novel underlying mechanism. \n\nIn conclusion, brain regions such as LC, raphe nucleus, PAG, reticular formation, parabrachial nucleus, VTA, and LDTg play important roles in NDPH. These regions constitute a complex neural circuit of headache, and abnormal FC may contribute to headache onset and exacerbation. For example, regions such as the LC and para\u2010brachial nucleus are involved in pain regulation and transmission, and when their FC is altered, it may lead to an exacerbation of pain perception. The raphe nucleus and reticular formation are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow. Abnormal activity of raphe nucleus and reticular formation may lead to vasodilation and blood flow changes, which may cause headache. In contrast, PAG, VTA, and LDTg are related to emotion regulation and stress, and their dysfunction may lead to worsening headache. Therefore, changes in FC of these brain regions are closely related to headache, and an in\u2010depth understanding of these neural mechanisms can help to better understand and treat headache symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, it is important to note that this study was conducted at a single center with a relatively small sample size, and thus, our preliminary findings require validation with larger datasets. Secondly, as a cross\u2010sectional study, we were unable to assess the changes in FC over the course of disease progression or determine their reversibility. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the correlation between FC and prognosis as well as disease progression. Moreover, the use of the 76 brainstem regions as seeds in this study limited our analysis to the whole regions without considering their subregions. Notably, different subregions of the seeds may possess distinct physiological functions that could influence FC analyses. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that psychiatric comorbidities, particularly chronic anxiety and depression, even if at a low grade and untreated, might impact FC in NDPH. Further investigations are necessary to assess whether such comorbidities contributed to the observed FC abnormalities. Therefore, future studies should explore the FC within the subregions of these seeds to enhance our understanding of the central pathogenesis of NDPH. Additionally, applying comparative analysis of established FC using cross\u2010correlation synchronization indices and dynamic FC between these different ROIs might yield significant conclusions. Conducting a subgroup analysis to explore differences between NDPH subgroups could uncover valuable insights, potentially differentiating NDPH more clearly from other headache types. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nGiven the persistent pain experienced in NDPH, the lack of identifiable causes, and the absence of evidence\u2010based treatment options, it is crucial to investigate this debilitating yet low\u2010incidence condition. This study aims to explore the FC of various brainstem regions in adults with NDPH. The results indicate abnormal FC in multiple brainstem nuclei implicated in pain and emotions processing and regulation among NDPH patients. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of central nervous system dysfunction underlying associated symptoms in NDPH and offer potential avenues for physicians to explore in the management of chronic pain. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nWei Wang, Yonggang Wang, and Binbin Sui supported the conception and design of this project.

Here, we analyzed FG components to uncover possible alterations in cortical hierarchy using resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) data acquired in 122 MS patients and 97 healthy control (HC) subjects. Cortical hierarchy was assessed by deriving regional FG scores from rs\u2010fMRI connectivity matrices using a functional parcellation of the cerebral cortex. The FG analysis identified a primary (visual\u2010to\u2010sensorimotor) and a secondary (sensory\u2010to\u2010transmodal) component. Results showed a significant alteration in cortical hierarchy as indexed by regional changes in FG scores in MS patients within the sensorimotor network and a compression (i.e., a reduced standard deviation across all cortical parcels) of the sensory\u2010transmodal gradient axis, suggesting disrupted segregation between sensory and cognitive processing. Moreover, FG scores within limbic and default mode networks were significantly correlated ( ,   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 after Bonferroni correction for both) with the symbol digit modality test (SDMT) score, a measure of information processing speed commonly used in MS neuropsychological assessments. Finally, leveraging supervised machine learning, we tested the predictive value of network\u2010level FG features, highlighting the prominent role of the FG scores within the default mode network in the accurate prediction of SDMT scores in MS patients (average mean absolute error of 1.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 points on a hold\u2010out set of 24 patients). Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of FG alterations in MS, shedding light on the hierarchical organization of the MS brain and suggesting that FG connectivity analysis can be regarded as a valuable approach in rs\u2010fMRI studies across different MS populations. \n  \n  \nFunctional connectivity gradients reveal significant alterations in the sensorimotor network hierarchy and a compression of the sensory\u2010transmodal gradient, indicating disrupted segregation between sensory and cognitive processing, in multiple sclerosis patients. \n  \nFunctional connectivity gradients within limbic and default mode networks are associated with information processing speed in multiple sclerosis patients. \n    \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (Filippi et al.,\u00a0 ). The clinical manifestations of MS are heterogeneous, encompassing a wide range of symptoms, from physical (e.g., visual, sensory and motor disturbances) to cognitive impairments (e.g., deficits in information processing speed [IPS], episodic memory, attention, executive function) (Filippi et al.,\u00a0 ). Since MS can be regarded as a brain network disorder (Schoonheim et al.,\u00a0 ), many studies have explored the impact of the MS disease on functional connectivity (FC) estimated from resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) time\u2010series (Bisecco et al.,\u00a0 ; Bommarito et al.,\u00a0 ; Faivre et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoonheim et al.,\u00a0 ; Shu et al.,\u00a0 ; Ver\u00e9b et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nA well\u2010known principle applied in whole\u2010brain FC analyses is that the human cortex is organized as multiple large\u2010scale networks which can be reliably assessed from rs\u2010fMRI data (Thomas Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). A previous study has provided evidence that large\u2010scale FC networks follow a hierarchical arrangement, with primary sensory networks at the bottom, the default mode network (DMN) at the top and the other networks spanning between these two extremes (Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ). Particularly, the hierarchical organization of the cortex is thought to serve a vital role in supporting increasingly abstract, from lower\u2010 (perception) to higher\u2010 (cognition) order, brain functions. This hierarchy is achieved by effectively segregating the information from the immediate environment reaching the primary sensory networks, from the more complex, self\u2010generated and abstract information processing occurring in higher\u2010level (integrative) networks (Lanzoni et al.,\u00a0 ; Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ; Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ; Yang et al.,\u00a0 ). To give a more comprehensive account of the hierarchical axis governing the brain functional organization, Margulies et al. ( ) introduced a computational method based on dimensionality reduction techniques. The method involves the projection of high\u2010dimensional FC matrix data onto a series of low\u2010dimensional representations, referred to as functional gradients (FGs), which correspond to the principal components of the FC matrix as obtained via diffusion distance mapping (Coifman et al.,\u00a0 ). Diffusion distances represent intrinsic geometric quantities enabling the integration of connectivity values within a coherent multiscale structure (Coifman et al.,\u00a0 ). Indeed, as connectivity measurements include both short\u2010 (i.e., small\u2010scale) and long\u2010 (i.e., large\u2010scale) range connections, diffusion maps translate these connections into distances enabling the representation of the entire FC structure as a distribution of cortical points in an embedding space. As such, FG values are eigenvalues, and therefore have arbitrary units with no physical meaning, but they represent the relative position of each point\/region with respect to the other points\/regions along a specific axis (and, therefore, address the similarity of their connectivity profiles), with the two extremes of this axis having the maximum diffusion distance. In their work, Margulies et al. ( ) provided evidence that these FGs are organized along dimensions that describe cortical regions in a hierarchical manner. Thus, estimated FG scores provide a description of the principal axes of spatial FC organization as dictated by the intrinsic similarities among FC patterns. Particularly, FGs, not only represent the dominant patterns of spatial co\u2010variation in functional organization across the cortex, but are also implicitly ordered in terms of the percentage of (co)variance in FC similarity that they explain (Pang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nFGs have been widely used for investigating brain hierarchical organization in various pathological populations, including migraine (Lee et al.,\u00a0 ), Alzheimer's disease (Borne et al.,\u00a0 ; Hu et al.,\u00a0 ), epilepsy (Lucas et al.,\u00a0 ; Meng et al.,\u00a0 ), as well as in healthy individuals (Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ; Cross et al.,\u00a0 ; Katsumi et al.,\u00a0 ; Kong et al.,\u00a0 ; Shen et al.,\u00a0 ; Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ; Yang et al.,\u00a0 ). However, to date, gradients have never been studied in an MS population. \n\nIn this study, our primary objective was to investigate alterations in whole\u2010brain FGs among patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS and to assess how possible FC anomalies would impact large\u2010scale networks' hierarchy when compared to individuals from a healthy control (HC) group. We then explored correlations between FG estimates and the most common clinical and neuropsychological scores used in MS patients' assessment. Additionally, using a supervised machine learning framework, we sought to test the performances of FG features as potential imaging markers for predicting IPS of MS patients, as measured by symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) score, that is, the most common metric of cognition in MS, which has been successfully predicted with different FC features in other works (Buyukturkoglu et al.,\u00a0 ; Lin et al.,\u00a0 ; Welton et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 122 patients diagnosed with relapsing\u2013remitting MS (age\u2009=\u200937.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9\u2009years; 84 females) and 97 sex\u2010 and age\u2010matched HC subjects (age\u2009=\u200938.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0\u2009years; 56 females) were consecutively recruited at the University of Campania \u201cLuigi Vanvitelli\u201d (Naples, Italy). As for the inclusion criteria, MS patients had to have a diagnosis of MS according to the revised McDonald criteria (Thompson et al.,\u00a0 ) and a relapsing\u2013remitting phenotype. As for the HC subjects, no T2 hyperintense lesions had to be shown in the MRI scanning. Both MS patients and HCs had to be between 18 and 65\u2009years old, with no history of psychiatric illness. All enrolled participants underwent a neurological evaluation, including the assignment of an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) (Kurtzke,\u00a0 ), and a neuropsychological assessment, including the brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological tests (BRB\u2010N) (Boringa et al.,\u00a0 ). Among the BRB\u2010N tests, we specifically focused on the SDMT (Benedict et al.,\u00a0 ), which is widely used to assess IPS in MS patients (Chiaravalloti & DeLuca,\u00a0 ). To interpret the SDMT scores accurately, demographic\u2010 and education\u2010adjusted scores were calculated using available normative data based on a sample of 200 healthy Italian adults (Amato et al.,\u00a0 ), which were then standardized as Z\u2010scores. All demographic and clinical information are summarized in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nDemographic and clinical information of study participants. Mean and standard deviation are reported, except for EDSS (median and inter\u2010quartile range). \n    \n\n###  MRI   acquisition \n  \nAll participants underwent the same MRI imaging protocol, which included 3D T1\u2010weighted (T1w), 2D fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and rs\u2010fMRI scans, on the same MRI 3 Tesla scanner (Signa HDxt, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA) which was equipped with an eight\u2010channel head coil. The 3D T1w images were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 6.9 ms; echo time (TE) = 2.8 ms; inversion time (TI) = 650 ms; field of view (FOV) = 256 \u00d7 256 mm ; flip angle = 8; number of slices = 166; slice thickness = 1.2 mm; in\u2010plane resolution = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm. The 2D FLAIR images were acquired using the following parameters: TR = 9002 ms; TE = 121 ms; FOV = 512 \u00d7 512 mm ; flip angle = 90; number of slices = 44; slice thickness = 3 mm; in\u2010plane resolution = 0.47 mm \u00d7 0.47 mm. The rs\u2010fMRI data were acquired using the following parameters: TR = 1500 ms; TE = 32 ms; FOV = 64 \u00d7 64 mm ; flip angle = 90; number of slices = 29; slice thickness = 4 mm; in\u2010plane resolution = 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm; number of volumes = 240; scan duration = 6\u2009min. All exams were performed between 8 and 13\u2009a.m. and all subjects were instructed to stay motionless and awake during scanning. Prior to the resting\u2010state fMRI scan, the subjects were reminded via headphones to remain motionless and awake and to keep their eyes closed for the next 6\u2009min. Ethical approval was received from the local ethical standards committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of data acquisition. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were preprocessed using a fully automated pipeline specifically assembled for the serial extraction of FC features from rs\u2010fMRI data acquired in large samples of subjects including MS patients (De Rosa et al.,\u00a0 ). In detail, brain tissue segmentation was performed with FreeSurfer v7.1.1 (Fischl,\u00a0 ), employing 3D T1w and co\u2010registered FLAIR scans with the sequence adaptive multimodal segmentation (SAMSEG) (Cerri et al.,\u00a0 ) procedure to automatically and simultaneously perform whole\u2010brain tissue segmentation, including white matter (WM), gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, and MS lesion segmentation for lesion load (LL) estimation. Brain atrophy was estimated with the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) (Rudick et al.,\u00a0 ), calculated as brain parenchymal volume divided by intracranial volume. Functional MRI data preprocessing was carried out using fMRIPrep v20.2.1 (Esteban et al.,\u00a0 ). The preprocessing steps included skull stripping, motion correction, slice timing correction, susceptibility distortion correction, and co\u2010registration of the functional and anatomical scans. To address motion\u2010related noise, 24 motion\u2010related predictors were collected, consisting of the 6 head motion parameter time\u2010series, their first\u2010order derivatives and the corresponding 12 squared parameter time\u2010series (Friston et al.,\u00a0 ). An additional regressor was created from the instantaneous framewise displacement (FD) to account for residual motion\u2010related spikes (Power et al.,\u00a0 ; Satterthwaite et al.,\u00a0 ). These predictors were used as noise regressors in addition to the averaged physiological noise signals from WM and CSF masks. Spatial smoothing was not applied since our FG analysis essentially follows an ROI approach (see Section\u00a0  for details), where many rs\u2010fMRI signals from neighboring voxels are averaged, whether smoothing is applied or not, to produce the time series that represent the ROI activity (Alak\u00f6rkk\u00f6 et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, being FC dependent on internode distance, spatial smoothing could introduce distance\u2010dependent errors into connectivity matrices (Fornito et al.,\u00a0 ). Finally, the time series were subjected to band\u2010pass filtering between 0.01 and 0.1\u2009Hz. \n\n\n### FGs computation \n  \nThe FC matrix was computed for each individual by employing pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients for the averaged rs\u2010fMRI time series extracted from 200 distinct brain regions defined using a functional local\u2013global parcellation (Schaefer et al.,\u00a0 ). According to this parcellation, each region can be seen as a connectome node uniquely assigned to one out of seven large\u2010scale functional networks as derived from a previous normative rs\u2010fMRI study (Thomas Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). The correlation coefficients underwent Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformation prior to FG estimation. \n\nFGs were computed using BrainSpace, an open\u2010source tool available at   (Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ). Consistently with previous studies (Cross et al.,\u00a0 ; Meng et al.,\u00a0 ; Paquola et al.,\u00a0 ; Yang et al.,\u00a0 ), a parcel\u2010to\u2010parcel affinity matrix was initially calculated to capture the spatial similarity in the FC patterns between brain regions. Specifically, we used a cosine similarity kernel and retained the top 10% of all weighted connections per row. FGs were then obtained through the diffusion map embedding algorithm, which is a robust and computationally efficient nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman et al.,\u00a0 ). With diffusion maps, decreasing eigenvalues reflect the intrinsic ordering of the diffusion process, thereby possible changes in regional FG values would reflect a relative change in the position along the hierarchy established by the corresponding gradient axis. In the resulting embedding space, cortical nodes that exhibit stronger interconnections, either through numerous connections or a few very strong connections are positioned closely together, whereas nodes with weaker or no connections are situated farther apart. For the sake of interpretability, we focused on the first two FGs, in line with previous works (Petersen et al.,\u00a0 ; Xiao et al.,\u00a0 ; Zang et al.,\u00a0 ), as these will describe more variance of the overall FC data and identify the two main cortical hierarchies previously described in literature (Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ). A gradient template was constructed using a group\u2010averaged FC matrix from the data sets of all MS and HC individuals. Subsequently, to allow comparisons between subjects, we performed a Procrustes analysis to align the individual participants' cortical gradients with the template (Langs et al.,\u00a0 ; Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ). These components, which were initially defined in each subject's native space, were finally mapped to the cortical surface to visualize macroscale transitions in the overall FC patterns. Figure\u00a0  illustrates the processing pipeline to obtain FG estimates from the FC matrix. \n  \nThe functional gradient pipeline. (a) Functional time\u2010series data are extracted from preprocessed functional MRI (fMRI) data and parcellated into 200 cortical regions using the Schaefer atlas. Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated between each pair of the averaged regional time\u2010series, resulting in a 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200 functional connectivity (FC) matrix. (b) Similarity in connectivity profiles between regions within the FC matrix are estimated based on the difference in angle between pairs of vectors of the FC matrix. Similarity is then expressed through a cosine similarity matrix, representing the shared connectivity patterns between each pair of regions. (c) The application of diffusion map embedding returns a set of principal components ordered by decreasing explained variance. The first two eigenvectors are kept and correspond to the principal and secondary gradient. These eigenvectors are mapped on the cortical surface to visualize the spatial distribution and topology of each gradient. \n  \nWe also analyzed gradients at the network level using the seven canonical large\u2010scale rs\u2010fMRI networks (Thomas Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ) with three different gradient metrics. Specifically, in addition to within\u2010network scores, obtained by averaging the gradient values within each network, we calculated within\u2010network dispersion and between\u2010network dispersion (Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ). These metrics were calculated for each participant within the individual, aligned two\u2010dimensional gradient space, with each axis representing primary and secondary gradient scores. Within\u2010network dispersion, calculated as the sum of squared Euclidean distances of all network nodes from the network centroid, indicates the degree of differentiation of the single network, thereby, lower (higher) values indicate more (less) uniform FC patterns within that network. Between\u2010network dispersion, calculated as the Euclidean distance between network centroids, indicates the degree of specificity of the network with respect to the other networks, thereby, lower (higher) values indicate less (more) differentiated FC patterns across different networks. \n\nFinally, a global metric expressing the overall gradient variation was calculated as the standard deviation of each gradient across the whole brain, thereby, higher (lower) values reflect a higher (lower) heterogeneity in the connectivity patterns across all brain regions. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nTo evaluate between\u2010group differences in regional and network FG scores (i.e., comparing for each region of the Schaefer atlas and for each network of the Yeo parcellation, respectively), we performed statistical analyses on the first two principal components using a multivariate linear model (Hotelling's   T   test) implemented in BrainStat, an analysis tool available at   (Larivi\u00e8re et al.,\u00a0 ). The model aimed to examine differences in FG estimates (response variables) between patient and control groups (explanatory variable), controlling for age, sex, and mean FD. Furthermore, we also used linear models to investigate differences both in terms of within\u2010 and between\u2010network dispersion and of whole\u2010brain gradient variation, controlling for age, sex, and mean FD. \n\nFinally, to study the association of gradient metrics with clinical and neuropsychological scores (i.e., EDSS, disease duration and SDMT) and structural\u2010derived metrics (i.e., LL and BPF), we conducted a correlation analysis using Spearman's correlation. \n\nFor all statistical tests, correction of   p  \u2010values for multiple comparisons was applied using Bonferroni method. \n\n\n### Machine learning analysis \n  \nA supervised machine learning approach was employed to assess the performances of within\u2010network FG scores as predictive features for SDMT scores. Specifically, we trained a regression model using XGBoost with fivefold nested cross\u2010validation (Chen & Guestrin,\u00a0 ; Tibshirani,\u00a0 ; Varma & Simon,\u00a0 ). XGBoost is a scalable end\u2010to\u2010end tree boosting system that has gained widespread popularity for achieving state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art performance on many recent machine learning challenges (Chen & Guestrin,\u00a0 ). Notably, one of its major advantages lies in the great potential interpretability, due to its recursive tree\u2010based decision framework (Fratello et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTo train, validate and test the XGBoost regression model we adopted the following approach: the entire dataset was partitioned into a training\/validation set (80%) and a hold\u2010out test set (20%). Within the training\/validation set, we performed nested cross\u2010validation, where the inner loop was used to select the optimal hyperparameters configuration for the XGBoost model, while the outer loop was employed for feature selection and model validation. To select the optimal hyperparameters configuration, we employed grid search. To select the best feature set, we used an automated procedure recently applied in other studies (Marzi et al.,\u00a0 ; Yan et al.,\u00a0 ). This procedure leverages the importance gain estimated by XGBoost, which reflects the improvement in performance contributed by each feature. We then iteratively trained new XGBoost models using the top n features (  n  \u2009=\u20091, 2, 3, \u2026) in the feature ranking obtained using all the features with the best model selected from the inner loops. The final feature set was chosen based on the best performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). The entire nested cross\u2010validation procedure was repeated 10 times with different fold splits to prevent subject selection bias. To evaluate prediction accuracy, we calculated the average MAE on the validation sets of the outer loops. Significance was determined based on 1000 permutation tests, where participants' SDMT scores were randomly shuffled. Finally, for each repetition, we measured the final model performance on the hold\u2010out test set. \n\n\n### Experimental setup \n  \nPreprocessing of neuroimaging data was carried out on a HP Z6 G4 workstation equipped with two 8\u2010core Intel (R) Xeon (R) Bronze 3106 @1.70\u2009GHz (for a total of 16 CPU threads) and 128 GB RAM. For each subject, the total processing time was approximately 4\u2009h. \n\nComputational analyses, including FG calculations from neuroimaging data and machine learning, were carried out on an ASUS Pro WS WRX80E\u2010SAGE SE WIFI workstation equipped with a 64\u2010core AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5995WX (for a total of 128 CPU threads), a NVIDIA RTX A6000 48 GB GPU and 514 GB RAM. FGs were computed using the BrainSpace toolbox in MATLAB v9.14.0 (R2023a). Statistical and machine learning analyses were carried out with custom\u2010made codes in Python (v. 3.10). The total computation time for training, validating and testing the model was approximately of 9\u2009h. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Clinical and demographical characteristics \n  \nThere were no significant differences in age (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.36,   p  \u2009=\u2009.72), sex ( ,   p  \u2009=\u2009.12) and education (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22121.1,   p  \u2009=\u2009.25) among the groups (see Table\u00a0 ). Two (out of 122) MS patients and two (out of 97) HC subjects were left\u2010handed. No subjects were excluded from the subsequent analyses due to excessive head motion (i.e., mean FD\u2009>\u20090.5\u2009mm). However, six MS patients and one HC subject were excluded due to misregistration of some regions (and therefore missing data from the corresponding nodes of the connectome). \n\n\n### FGs differences \n  \nThe first two FGs explained, respectively, 39.0 and 21.8% of the overall variance in the whole\u2010brain averaged connectome. Albeit the scree plot of eigenvalues (Figure\u00a0 ) indicates a substantial reduction in explained variance after the third principal component, we decided to focus specifically on the first two gradients, as they offer a more straightforward and readily interpretable perspective, as supported by existing literature. Indeed, when projecting the FG values to the cortical surface, the principal gradient highlighted a cortical hierarchy spanning from the visual to the sensorimotor network, while the secondary gradient highlighted a typical (see, e.g., Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ) sensory\u2010transmodal axis (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nFunctional gradients derived from the group\u2010averaged functional connectivity matrix. (a) Visualization of the functional gradients mapped onto cortical surfaces. The principal gradient (gradient 1) reveals the visual\u2010sensorimotor axis, while the secondary gradient (gradient 2) reveals the sensory\u2010transmodal axis. (b) Scree plot of the eigenvalues estimated with the diffusion embedding algorithm. (c) Scatterplot of gradient values in Euclidean space. \n  \nThe multivariate analysis revealed significant between\u2010group differences in regional FGs between MS and HC groups. Specifically, we observed significant group effects in two regions of the sensorimotor network after correction for multiple comparisons (  T  \u2009=\u20094.13,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05;   T  \u2009=\u20094.48,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nBetween\u2010group differences in the first two gradients between multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy controls (after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, i.e.,   p  \u2009<\u2009.05\/200) shown on cortical surface. \n  \nThese findings on the regional FG were consistent with network\u2010level FG comparison: indeed, when the group effect was assessed within the seven intrinsic functional communities, patients with MS exhibited significant alterations of within\u2010network gradient values in the sensorimotor network (  T  \u2009=\u20093.13,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0 ). Compared to HC subjects, MS patients showed a reduced within\u2010network dispersion in the visual network (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.91,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0 ), alongside with reduced between\u2010network dispersions involving mainly the sensorimotor network, albeit none of them survived multiple comparison correction (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nNetwork\u2010level comparison.

Healthy controls are displayed on the right side of each violin plot (cyan), while multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are displayed on the left (red).

DAN, dorsal attention network; DMN, default mode network; FPN, frontoparietal network; LN, limbic network; SMN, sensorimotor network; VAN, ventral attention network; VN, visual network. \n  \nFinally, even at the global level, MS patients showed a significantly reduced secondary gradient variation across all brain regions (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.68,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n### Correlation with   MS   scores \n  \nWe explored the potential association between network\u2010level gradient metrics and disease duration and two other key MS scores (such as EDSS and SDMT) with Spearman's correlation. Among patients with MS, we discovered significant correlations between SDMT scores and the within\u2010network second gradient values in the limbic network (  p  \u2009=\u20090.001,  , CI\u2009=\u2009[0.12, 0.46]) and in the DMN (  p  \u2009=\u20090.001,  , CI\u2009=\u2009[0.13, 0.46]). No significant correlations were found between disease duration or EDSS and network gradient values. No significant correlations were found between MS scores and network dispersion or variation metrics. No significant correlations were found between any gradient metric and structural metrics (LL and BPF). \n\n\n### Prediction of   SDMT   scores \n  \nWe used supervised machine learning to train an XGBoost regressor to predict SDMT scores using network\u2010level gradient scores. Across 10 repetitions, secondary gradient values from the default mode, ventral attention and limbic networks (ranked as averaged information gain, Figure\u00a0 ) mainly contributed to the prediction of SDMT scores and the prediction performance on the validation set was statistically significant when compared against the null distribution as obtained from the permutation tests (MAE\u2009=\u20091.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Finally, the model has been tested on the hold\u2010out test set obtaining an average MAE of 1.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07. In a post hoc analysis, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between each of the top three ranked features and the predicted SDMT scores. This analysis aimed at evaluating the marginal direction of influence for the top contributing features (i.e., whether lower or higher values lead to lower or higher predicted scores). Across 10 repetitions of the nested cross\u2010validation, Spearman's   \u03c1   consistently exhibited a positive trend for the default mode and limbic networks (  \u03c1  \u2009=\u20090.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 and   \u03c1  \u2009=\u20090.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09, respectively). Conversely, the correlation was consistently negative for the ventral attention network (  \u03c1  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11). \n  \nFeature ranking using the XGBoost regression model.

Several previous works highlighted network\u2010level connectivity alterations in MS disease (Bisecco et al.,\u00a0 ; Bommarito et al.,\u00a0 ; Faivre et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoonheim et al.,\u00a0 ; Shu et al.,\u00a0 ; Ver\u00e9b et al.,\u00a0 ) but whether and how network hierarchy changes in MS has remained elusive. To address this gap, we sought to investigate alterations in whole\u2010brain FC in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS, focusing on the hierarchical axes of cortical organization by employing a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to generate low\u2010dimensional representations of FC matrices, commonly referred to as FGs (Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ; Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ; Park et al.,\u00a0 ; Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nPreliminarily, we observed that the order of the first two FG patterns was inverted with respect to previous findings. In particular, the principal gradient was anchored between the visual and sensorimotor networks and this closely resembled the secondary gradient previously identified in (Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ). Instead, the secondary gradient showed a gradual axis of connectivity variation, with the visual network on one end and the DMN on the other, with intermediary networks in between, similar to the principal gradient previously identified in (Margulies et al.,\u00a0 ). This discrepancy has been previously observed and attributed to different factors, including preprocessing strategies (Hong et al.,\u00a0 ; Knodt et al.,\u00a0 ), age range of the studied population (Bethlehem et al.,\u00a0 ; Hu et al.,\u00a0 ), and sample size (Zang et al.,\u00a0 ), whereas it should be independent from parcellation resolution (Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ). In this study, participants were relatively young, thus suggesting that age should not significantly affect FGs; on the other hand, the sample size was not as small as in other works reporting the canonical FGs (Lee et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize an influence of the rs\u2010fMRI data preprocessing strategy behind the inverted FGs. However, a robust and validated preprocessing pipeline (Esteban et al.,\u00a0 ) was used for the present study and a systematic investigation on the impact of different preprocessing strategies on the order of FGs is beyond the scope of this work. \n\nWe investigated FGs at three different scales: regional\u2010level (regional gradient scores), network\u2010level (within\u2010network gradient score and dispersion metrics) and global\u2010level (gradient variation). As we used the functional local to global parcellation by Schaefer et al. ( ), we were guaranteed that each parcel was also identically assigned to one (and only one) of the seven large\u2010scale networks. Hence, we assigned a gradient score to each network. While this metric is not a direct measure of cortical hierarchy, it provides an alternative perspective on the brain functional organization and on whether this organization varies between healthy subjects and MS patients. Indeed, when compared between two groups, within\u2010network gradient scores provide insight into whether a network, on average and on a broader scale than cortical FGs, occupies a different position in the brain hierarchy. In essence, the seven pre\u2010defined networks served as geometrical constraints to derive a network gradient metric built upon the data driven method. Our results revealed atypical hierarchical organization in the sensorimotor areas of MS patients compared to the control group, both at regional\u2010 and network\u2010level. Albeit only descriptively, we could show how these changes in the gradient architecture seem to have deeply impacted the macroscale network organization, as also suggested by the reduced between\u2010network dispersion of the sensorimotor network, which clearly indicated a worse differentiation from the other networks. Moreover, we found that the visual network in MS patients was significantly less dispersed compared to HC subjects. Finally, the secondary gradient (i.e., the sensory\u2010transmodal gradient) was significantly more compressed (meaning that it showed reduced variation) in the MS group. \n\nThrough correlation analyses, we identified significant associations between the second gradient values in the limbic and DMNs and the SDMT scores within the MS group. These findings provide valuable insights into how FC hierarchy alterations relate to IPS in MS. To further explore the potential clinical significance of FGs and their predictive power for cognitive status, we leveraged supervised machine learning. Specifically, we employed an XGBoost regression model and implemented a rigorous nested cross\u2010validation strategy for hyperparameters tuning and feature selection in the training\/validation set. Moreover, since these decisions may vary depending on how the training\/validation data are split in each fold, we repeated this process 10 times. Finally, the selected best model was evaluated on a hold\u2010out test set. Our findings from supervised machine learning revealed that the within\u2010network FG score in the DMN play a crucial role in predicting SDMT scores, that is, IPS, of MS patients. \n\nOverall, the present study provides novel evidence that the sensorimotor hierarchy is significantly altered in patients with MS compared to HCs. This observation reflects disrupted segregation between the sensorimotor and the remaining networks, as suggested by the altered between\u2010network dispersion. Dysfunction in the sensorimotor network has been widely documented for patients with MS in previous studies (Carotenuto et al.,\u00a0 ; Jaeger et al.,\u00a0 ; Rocca et al.,\u00a0 ; Schiavi et al.,\u00a0 ; Schoonheim et al.,\u00a0 ; Strik et al.,\u00a0 ). In particular, the work of Strik et al. ( ) highlighted the clinical relevance of functional changes in the sensorimotor network, which were showed to occur independently from structural damage. Consistent with these results, the current study revealed a different aspect of such alterations in the sensorimotor network, possibly suggesting that the pathological interaction between sensory and cognitive processes in MS would be reflected also by an abnormal communication between the sensorimotor and the high order cognitive systems along the hierarchical organization of the brain, and not necessarily by the structural damage (e.g., LL) or atrophy (e.g., BPF). This disrupted integration process has been further characterized in this study by the overall compression of the sensory\u2010transmodal gradient, which reflects diminished separation between sensory systems (e.g., visual and sensory regions), responsible for the immediate environment processing, and transmodal cognitive systems (e.g. frontoparietal and default mode regions), that support complex cognitive functions (Dong et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe range of individual networks across gradients was also altered in MS patients, with reduced within\u2010network dispersion in the visual network, thus suggesting more homogeneous FC patterns. Notably, previous studies using rs\u2010fMRI in MS have already observed FC anomalies in visual network regions (Backner et al.,\u00a0 ; Gallo et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nWe have also showed a significant correlation between SDMT scores and the within\u2010network secondary gradient values in the limbic and DMNs, implying an association in our cohort of patients between the variance in FG secondary patterns across these two networks and SDMT scores. These findings are consistent with previous studies that applied different frameworks for the FC analysis of rs\u2010fMRI data (e.g., comparing FC maps or independent components or applying graph theory metrics to the connectome). Particularly, the limbic network is known to be involved in memory, emotional processing and reward\u2010related functions (Cao et al.,\u00a0 ; Rolls,\u00a0 ) and its dysfunction in MS patients has been previously reported. Bisecco et al. ( ) found a significant association in certain regions of the limbic network between FC and social cognition, which is a strong correlate of SDMT (Bisecco et al.,\u00a0 ; Raimo et al.,\u00a0 ). The DMN is another crucial brain network implicated in cognitive dysfunction in MS (Bommarito et al.,\u00a0 ; Bonavita et al.,\u00a0 ; Bonavita et al.,\u00a0 ; Eijlers et al.,\u00a0 ; Rocca et al.,\u00a0 ), and particularly its association with IPS has been also reported (Has Silemek et al.,\u00a0 ; van Geest et al.,\u00a0 ). No significant correlations were found with nonspecific measures, such as disease duration and EDSS scores. \n\nOur findings were further reinforced by the integration of a machine learning framework designed to predict SDMT performance using within\u2010network gradient scores. We decided to restrict the prediction analysis to SDMT since EDSS, the most common measure to evaluate disease\u2010related disability, as a general (multi\u2010domain) score, has been showed to be less sensitive to FC changes induced by large\u2010scale networks remodeling (Cipriano et al.,\u00a0 ). Indeed, it has been showed that SDMT is the most reliable and sensitive cognitive measure in MS and is commonly regarded as the best predictor of cognitive status (Benedict et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Schependom et al.,\u00a0 ). Moreover, several previous works showed that FC changes were significantly associated with SDMT (Buyukturkoglu et al.,\u00a0 ; Lin et al.,\u00a0 ; Welton et al.,\u00a0 ). Here, we adopted the hold\u2010out method to split the entire dataset into a training\/validation set (80%) and test set (20%). Within the training\/validation set, a fivefold nested CV scheme was applied, enabling simultaneous hyperparameters optimization and feature selection. It is noteworthy that, to the best of our knowledge, only Marzi et al. ( ) applied such a similar rigorous split of training\/validation and test sets to predict a cognitive score in an MS population, but no other works have focused on prediction relying exclusively on FC features. Results revealed that secondary FGs from the default mode, ventral attention and limbic networks provided the top three FG features contributing to the prediction of individual SDMT scores (thereby suggesting that changes in these features have a larger impact on predictions), with the DMN, in particular, emerging as an important potential predictor of cognitive status in MS patients. Notably, FC alterations within the DMN have been previously recognized to provide a potential marker for cognitive impairment (Bonavita et al.,\u00a0 ; Eijlers et al.,\u00a0 ). Indeed, the DMN plays a critical role as a central hub for processing and integrating transmodal information, thus likely contributing to IPS dysfunction. We further investigated how single features affect predictions by examining the direction of their influence. Results revealed that higher secondary gradient values within limbic and DMNs, alongside with lower values within ventral attention network, are associated with higher predicted SDMT scores. Notably, while the former (positive) correlations aligned with the prior correlation analysis, the XGBoost predictive model additionally highlighted the role of the ventral attention network secondary gradient values in SDMT score prediction. The ventral attention network plays a critical role in regulating networks involved in cognition (Menon & Uddin,\u00a0 ). Moreover, FC changes in ventral attention network have been extensively reported in MS studies (Huang et al.,\u00a0 ; Rocca et al.,\u00a0 ) and a recent study from Huiskamp et al. ( ) demonstrated a negative correlation with cognitive performances (Huiskamp et al.,\u00a0 ). Altogether, these findings would allow indicating the degree of segregation between the ventral attention network and higher\u2010order networks (i.e., limbic and DMNs) as an important determinant of cognitive status prediction. More specifically, higher segregation seems to be more characteristic of MS patients with higher SDMT scores. \n\nOverall, this work presents compelling evidence that FGs, by addressing complementary FC aspects related to the hierarchical organization of typical FC networks, can serve as a reliable tool for analyzing rs\u2010fMRI data in the context of MS research. More importantly, network hierarchy provides a novel perspective for exploring the intricate neuro\u2010mechanisms underpinning MS. The added value of investigating macroscale functional anomalies with FGs lies in its ability to capture the whole\u2010brain organizational principles in a single manifold, overcoming the challenges associated with handling high\u2010dimensional FC matrices and offering more plausible and valuable insights into the integrated nature of neural processing. This seems to hold great potential and promise for shedding more light on the brain mechanisms underlying the switch between function and dysfunction. \n\nOur study has two potential limitations. First, lesion segmentation masks (and the derived LL) for a large cohort of MS patients were here obtained via a fully automated segmentation method (SAMSEG) without manual review. In fact, the SAMSEG method incorporates a sufficiently general model for WM lesions which has been previously validated with, and shown to adapt well to, several data sets acquired with different scanners and imaging protocols (Cerri et al.,\u00a0 ). Nonetheless, most currently available fully automated methods for lesion segmentation may include some degree of error which would be only addressed by careful visual inspection followed by expert manual review of each individual mask, thereby the results of the structural analysis involving estimated LL (i.e., correlation with within\u2010network FG values) should be taken with more caution. For this reason, we also did not further explore whether the location, shape or type of the estimated lesions had an impact on FGs. Second, to limit the dimensionality of the FC matrix, we chose a brain functional parcellation for FG computation at a scale of 200 nodes even if we could presume that by increasing spatial resolution the delineation of FC gradients might have resulted more pronounced. However, this would be certainly true and effective for the purposes of the present study only when using anatomically\u2010informed parcellations (see, e.g., Vos de Wael et al.,\u00a0 ) whereas we expressly chose a functionally\u2010informed parcellation, that is, the local\u2013global parcellation originally derived by Schaefer et al. ( ), also because a high correspondence between Mesulam's classic scheme of cortical hierarchy (Mesulam,\u00a0 ) and FGs, was highlighted for this specific brain parcellation, even at a coarser scale (i.e., 300 nodes or less). Thus, future studies focusing on FGs in MS should assess the possible association with anatomy and structure in general and with lesions in particular (including location and type) with more resolution (e.g., at a higher scale) and precision, thus providing more information on how the neuroinflammatory processes of the MS disease contribute to, or interact with, the observed alterations in the cortical hierarchy. \n\nIn conclusion, in this study, we investigated the alterations in FGs in patients with MS compared to HCs. By exploring alterations in the whole\u2010brain cortical hierarchy, we expanded previous research that primarily focused on disruptions of network connectivity. We complemented these findings by conducting a machine learning prediction analysis. Our work may provide valuable insights into the comprehensive understanding of whole\u2010brain alterations in MS patients, particularly on network hierarchy anomalies. \n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION \n  \nThis work was supported by #NEXTGENERATIONEU (NGEU) and funded by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR), National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), project MNESYS (PE0000006)\u2014A multiscale integrated approach to the study of the nervous system in health and disease (DN. 1553 11.10.2022). \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11033924,"text_md5":"5d4a5b05407813f64c58762fd7635b69","field_positions":{"authors":[0,157],"journal":[158,172],"publication_year":[174,178],"title":[189,265],"keywords":[279,379],"abstract":[392,2839],"body":[2848,45393]},"batch":2,"pmid":38647001,"doi":"10.1002\/hbm.26678","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11033924","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11033924"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11033924\">11033924<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11033924  Functional gradients reveal cortical hierarchy changes in multiple sclerosis"}

A searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed an extensive network of frontal, basal ganglia, cingulate and limbic regions exhibiting significant predictability for autistic traits from patterns of responses to angry relative to neutral expression faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a genotype interaction (OXTR SNPs rs2254298, rs2268491) for coupling between the orbitofrontal cortex and mid-cingulate during angry expression processing, with a negative association between coupling and autistic traits in the risk-allele group and a positive one in the non-risk allele group. Overall, results indicate extensive emotion-specific associations primarily between patterns of neural responses to angry faces and autistic traits in regions processing motivation, reward and salience but not in early visual processing. Functional connections between these identified regions were not only associated with autistic traits but also influenced by OXTR genotype. Thus, altered patterns of neural responses to threatening faces may be a potential biomarker for autistic symptoms although modulatory influences of OXTR genotype need to be taken into account. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically exhibit general problems in discriminating and responding appropriately to face emotions [ \u2013 ], although it is unclear whether problems are generalized or emotion-specific [ ,  ]. While several meta-analyses demonstrate impaired recognition across all face emotions in ASD [ ,  ], findings are not consistent, with some studies reporting problems with only negative [ ,  ] or positive [ ] emotions while others have found no evidence for impairments [ \u2013 ]. This may reflect differences in tasks and the analytical approaches used [ ,  ]. Additionally, a recent large study has reported that face emotion recognition impairments in ASD may be primarily due to a low functioning sub-group [ ]. \n\nFace emotion recognition engages diverse psychological processes involving both subcortical and cortical circuitry [ \u2013 ]. Studies on face emotion processing distinguish a \u2018core system\u2019 implicated in visual processing and an \u2018extended system\u2019 for cognitive functions. The \u2018core system\u2019 is comprised of occipito-temporal regions while the \u2018extended system\u2019 includes the parietal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and basal ganglia [ ,  ]. Both \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018extended\u2019 processing systems exhibit atypical responses during face emotion recognition in ASD, with hypo- and hyper-activation being reported to all or specific emotional faces, particularly in the amygdala, fusiform face area, superior temporal sulcus and mPFC [ ,  \u2013 ]. On the other hand, some studies have found no differences in neural responses to emotional faces in ASD [ ,  ] or in only in a sub-type of ASD individuals who also showed low face emotion recognition abilities and more severe symptoms [ ]. \n\nThe variability in both behavioral and neuroimaging findings for emotional face processing impairment in ASD may reflect the large heterogeneity in this disorder as well as task and analytical differences. For example, while the estimated heritability of ASD is around 60\u201370%, over 200 specific risk genes identified [ ,  ] and heterogeneity in neural responses to social or other stimuli in ASD may therefore be contributed to by differences in genotypic as well as experiential contributions. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the role of the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin in social cognition and ASD [ ] with a number of studies having reported modulation of face emotion processing following intranasal administration of oxytocin in neurotypical individuals as well as those with ASD [ \u2013 ]. Peripheral oxytocin concentrations are decreased in children with ASD [ ], and some clinical trials have reported improved social symptoms following chronic treatment with intranasal oxytocin [ ,  \u2013 ] and increased visual attention towards emotional faces [ ]. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) are associated with ASD symptoms, and risk genes identified as contributing to ASD influence oxytocin signaling [ ,  ]. Evidence has repeatedly linked the polymorphisms of the OXTR gene, particularly the rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, and rs53576 SNPs with autism, empathy, and social and emotional processing [ \u2013 ]. The OXTR rs53576 SNP is also associated with general sociability [ ] and variations in rs2254298 may represent a trans-diagnostic biomarker for social dysfunction [ ]. Finally, reduced amygdala and arousal responses to intranasal oxytocin are modulated by OXTR genotype (both rs53576 and rs22542980) [ ]. \n\nGiven the variability of both behavioral and neural findings reported by studies in clinical populations of ASD individuals in relation to emotion processing, and the likely contribution that the well-known heterogeneity of such individuals diagnosed with this disorder could have, the current study aimed to utilize a Research Domain Criteria (RDoc) inspired dimensional approach [ ]. To this end we aimed to establish firstly whether autistic traits per se in a large sample of neurotypical individuals (  n  \u2009=\u2009255), not diagnosed with ASD, are associated with general or emotion-specific behavioral and neural responses to face expressions (angry, fear, happy, neutral and sad) and secondly if there are modulatory influences of their OXTR genotype. For the face emotion recognition task we used an implicit task approach where participants only had to identify the sex of individual displayed to help avoid participants trying to consciously identify face emotions during presentations in the MRI scanner rather than simply process face emotion stimuli. By including a simple requirement to identify the sex of the face presented we ensured that participants paid attention to the stimuli. Explicit face emotion recognition, where participants were required to actually identify specific face emotions, was also tested subsequently outside of the scanner to provide a measure of recognition accuracy and speed. Neuroimaging analyses based on univariate approaches have inherent limitations since they can only measure associations between activity changes for specific voxels or regions, so we therefore chose to use multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) [ ]. MVPA can decode the multivariate information contained in functional patterns using a classifier. By employing a searchlight strategy with machine learning it can determine differences in the patterns of activation exhibited which are predictive of specific features of individuals using the patterns of their neural responses to stimuli and without the potential bias of prior voxel selection [ ]. We therefore used MVPA to extract information from locally distributed fMRI-based patterns of activation during performance of a face emotion task to permit a powerful fine-grained analysis of differences in extensive neural activation patterns which are predictive of autistic traits. This MVPA approach has been used in several previous studies comparing small numbers of ASD and neurotypical individuals [ ,  ] but not in large scaled ones. Given that differences in patterns of neural responses across multiple brain regions identified by MVPA are likely to be influenced their functional connectivities, we additionally used a univariate analysis to investigate these. To assess potential modulatory effects of multiple OXTR genotypes on these ASQ-associated functional connectivities we then investigated whether the ASQ associations were modulated by individual OXTR genotype by examining the influence of four SNPs associated with autism and social cognition (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, rs53576) to determine whether autistic trait (Autism spectrum quotient (ASQ)) [ ,  ] associations were genotype-dependent. \n\nOverall, we hypothesized that there would be a negative association between autistic traits and accuracy in identifying the expressions but not the sex of emotional faces and that MVPA would reveal that there are patterns of activity in both \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018extended\u2019 face processing regions in response to specific emotions which are predictive of autistic trait scores. We also hypothesized further analysis would reveal that the strength of functional connectivity between regions identified by the MVPA as predictive of autistic trait scores would be associated with these scores in an OXTR genotype-dependent manner. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n255 neurotypical Han Chinese (male = 131; age range = 17\u201329 years, mean age   SD\u2009=\u200921.62   2.339 years) participants were enrolled (for inclusion criteria see  ). Sample size was not pre-determined but post-hoc analysis showed that this sample size achieved >90% power for a medium effect size in all types of statistical tests used in the data analysis (calculated by G*Power v3.1.9.4). Participants reported being free from current or past medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions, and no history of head injury or MRI contraindications. All volunteers were required to abstain from alcohol, caffeine-containing drinks, cigarettes or other psychoactive substances during the 24\u2009h prior to the experiment. Before the experiment all participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Institutional Review Board, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China) and in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was part of a large-scale fMRI project composed of multiple task-based paradigms investigating diverse questions including inhibitory control [ ,  ], imitation and the mirror neuron system [ ] and pain empathy [ ,  ]. In contrast to these previous studies, the current one aimed to establish associations between autistic traits and neural and behavioral responses to specific face emotions, along with modulatory effects of OXTR genotype. \n\nA total of 26 participants were excluded due to failure to complete the study (  n  \u2009=\u20096), head movement (  n  \u2009=\u200912; see fMRI data preprocessing for details) or technical failures (incomplete data,   n  \u2009=\u20098), leaving a final experimental cohort of 229 participants (males = 114). \n\n\n### Experimental procedures \n  \nThe experimental protocols are presented in Fig.  . Autistic traits were assessed by the ASQ [ ,  ] with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 scores in the present sample being 0.744. The ASQ is a widely used measure of autistic traits in both neurotypical and ASD individuals and comprises 50 self-report questions. It is not intended as a diagnostic tool per se and total scores for the level of autistic traits are calculated from responses to questions in five different sub-domains (social skills, social communication, attention to detail, attention switching and imagination). Total ASQ scores range from 0 and 50 with higher scores representing greater autistic traits and a suggested clinical threshold of scores above 32 [ ]. All participants provided buccal swaps for analysis of OXTR (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, rs53576) genotype (see   and [ ]).    Experimental protocol and the searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA).  \n a   The experimental protocols and event-related implicit emotion recognition fMRI paradigm.   b   Illustration of the searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Three-voxel radius spherical searchlights around center voxels were employed for each contrast separately, with individual beta maps as features to predict participants\u2019 ASQ scores. The optimal hyperplane was computed based on the multivariate pattern for 10 different iterations of a training cohort of a sub-set of participants and another excluded subset (test set). Regional activation patterns which could robustly predict autistic traits, pattern maps were corrected for multiple comparisons and a Pearson correlation analysis used to measure the correlation between actual and predicted ASQ scores and those predicted by the MVPA. \n  \n\nAn event-related design implicit emotional face recognition task was implemented during fMRI scanning. Fifty grayscale facial stimuli displaying angry, fear, happy, neural or sad expressions (  n  \u2009=\u200910 per category, 50% male, each from different identities) were presented twice in two runs with a different pseudorandom sequence for all participants for discrimination of sex (see Fig.   for paradigm and  ). About forty minutes after fMRI scanning participants completed a surprise explicit face recognition memory test to establish if they remembered the facial stimuli presented during fMRI. This was used to assess possible associations between autistic trait scores on the ASQ and accuracy and corresponding response times (RT), but was not used in the analysis of the previous fMRI responses (see   and Fig.  ). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a 3T GE MR750 system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA). High-resolution whole-brain T1-weighted structural MRI data were acquired to improve normalization of the functional images. Task-based fMRI data were acquired during the implicit face recognition task (lasted around 12\u2009min, two sessions were implemented, each session consisted of 173 volumes). Functional MRI data were preprocessed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ) (see   for details). \n\n\n### Analytic approach for behavioral data \n  \nDuring the fMRI implicit emotion recognition task, discrimination accuracy for the sex of faces and RT were calculated. For the post-fMRI test, recognition accuracy and RT for both the surprise face memory test and explicit emotion recognition task, as well as ratings of arousal and intensity were calculated. All RTs were calculated only for trials where accurate identification of face sex or emotion was shown. Repeated measures ANOVAs with emotion expression (angry, fear, sad, neutral, and happy) as the within-subject factor were conducted to explore the main effect of emotion expression on behavioral indices. To further investigate if autistic traits were associated with behavioral indices, correlational analyses (Pearson) were conducted. \n\n\n### Analytic approach for MRI data \n  \n#### General linear model (GLM) analyses \n  \nFirst-level general linear models (GLMs) for the task-based fMRI data included condition-specific regressors of the 5 emotions (angry, fear, happy, neutral, and sad) were modelled to generate main contrasts of interest (angry > neutral, fear > neutral, happy > neutral, sad > neutral) and the six movement parameters were included as nuisance regressors. \n\n\n#### Pattern-based MVPA analyses and thresholding \n  \nTo determine if local activation patterns were predictive of autistic traits (ASQ scores), a whole-brain (restricted to a grey matter mask) searchlight-based multivariate machine-learning pattern analysis was implemented (see Fig.   for illustration). Specifically, we employed a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm implemented in the Spider toolbox ( ) (linear kernel,   C  \u2009=\u20091) with three-voxel radius spherical searchlights around center voxels employed for each contrast separately, with individual beta maps as features to predict participants\u2019 ASQ scores. The accuracy with which the significant neural activation patterns in response to different face emotions identified by the MVPA could be predictive of actual ASQ scores was determined by a Pearson correlation analysis between the actual ASQ scores and those predicted by the MVPA. The prediction performance was evaluated by a tenfold cross-validation procedure during which all participants were randomly assigned to 10 subsamples of 22 or 23 participants using MATLAB\u2019s cvpartition function. The optimal hyperplane was computed based on the multivariate pattern of the labeled 206 or 207 participants (training set) and then evaluated using the excluded 22 or 23 participants (test set). This procedure was repeated 10 times with each subsample being the testing set once. To identify regional activation patterns which could robustly predict autistic traits, pattern maps were corrected for multiple comparisons, within a grey matter mask based on false discovery rate (FDR) and additionally taking into account multiple comparisons involving the different face emotions (i.e. 4 contrasts) resulting in a corrected threshold at a whole-brain voxel level of   q  \u2009=\u20090.0125 FDR corrected (two-sided). \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity (FC) analyses and thresholding \n  \nTo further explore associations between autistic traits and FC in face-emotion processing networks, and modulatory effects of OXTR genotype, seed-to-whole-brain FC analyses with the contrasts exhibiting significant results from the MVPA analyses were computed using generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) [ ]. Seeds (6-mm spheres) were placed at peak coordinates of significant clusters from the MVPA analyses. FC analysis firstly employed a whole brain approach with a significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 peak-level family-wise error (FWE) correction and a minimum voxel size of   k  \u2009>\u200910. To take into account the three different face emotions for which the MVPA showed significant effects Bonferroni corrections (\u00d73) were additionally applied. Brain regions were identified using the Automated Anatomic Labelling atlas 3 (AAL3) [ ] as implemented in the WFU Pick Atlas (School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina). \n\n\n#### Influence of OXTR genotype \n  \nSeed-region-specific connectivity maps were entered into two-sample t-test models, with genotype group (i.e., rs2254298- A+ vs. A- carriers), ASQ score as well as their interaction terms as covariates. When significant genotype \u00d7 ASQ interactions were found, parameter estimates from the significant clusters were extracted to visualize the interaction effects. Bonferroni corrections were applied for the number of SNPs and alleles (i.e. 4 \u00d7 2\u2009=\u20098). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample and genotyping \n  \nA total of 229 right-handed neurotypical Han Chinese participants (male = 114; mean age \u00b1 SD\u2009=\u200921.58\u2009\u00b1\u20092.343) were included in the final analysis (see Fig.   for exclusion flowchart). Distribution of the 4 OXTR (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, and rs53576) genotypes were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and alleles of the SNPs were divided into two groups as in previous studies [ ,  ] to increase statistical power and avoid statistical inference errors (see Table  ). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD total scores on the ASQ were 21.44\u2009\u00b1\u20095.60 (range 9\u201335). These ASQ scores are in good agreement with our previous large-scale (  n  \u2009=\u2009280) study on Chinese adult neurotypical individuals and there were also no significant differences in ASQ scores between males (21.56\u2009\u00b1\u20095.42, range 10\u201335) and females (21.32\u2009\u00b1\u20095.80, range 9-35) [ ] (  t  -test   p  \u2009=\u20090.747). \n\n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nTwo participants were additionally excluded due to incomplete data for the implicit emotion recognition task, leading to 227 participants (male = 112; mean age   SD\u2009=\u200921.57   2.351 years) included for behavioral data analyses. ANOVA results for the implicit emotion recognition task showed a main effect of face emotion for both accuracy (F \u2009=\u200921.257,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.086) and RTs (F \u2009=\u200924.747,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.099). Post-hoc Bonferroni corrected tests revealed that participants were less accurate for discriminating the sex of individuals with negative emotional expressions (angry, fear, and sad) compared to neutral and happy faces (all   p  s\u2009<\u20090.049) (Fig.  ). The RTs for all face emotions (angry, fear, sad and happy) were significantly longer than for neutral expressions (all   p  s\u2009<\u20090.002) (Fig.  ). Overall these results suggest that participants attentively processed the facial stimuli (i.e. discriminated the sex of individual faces accurately) and that presentation of negative emotional faces resulted in a lower accuracy and longer RTs.    Behavioral results.  \nDiscrimination of face sex (  a  ) accuracy rate and (  b  ) response time (RT) during the implicit emotion recognition task during fMRI scanning. *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01. \n  \n\nFor the post fMRI emotion recognition memory task an ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of emotion expression (F \u2009=\u200924.359,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.097) (F \u2009=\u200924.359,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.097). Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparisons showed participants remembered fearful, sad, and happy emotional faces better than neutral and angry ones, and fearful faces better than happy ones (see Supplementary Fig.  ). There was no main effect of emotion for RTs (F \u2009=\u20091.206,   p  \u2009=\u20090.305,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.005). \n\nFor emotion discrimination accuracy, an ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of emotion expression (F \u2009=\u2009105.298,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.318). Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparison showed participants exhibited the highest discrimination accuracy for happy faces and the lowest for fearful faces. For RTs there was also a main effect of emotion expression (F \u2009=\u2009140.011,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.383) with the shortest RTs for neutral expression faces and the longest for fearful ones. For arousal and intensity ratings, ANOVAs revealed significant main effects of emotion expression (Arousal: F \u2009=\u2009258.318,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.533; Intensity: F \u2009=\u2009319.985,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.586) with post-hoc comparisons showing participants rated angry faces as the most arousing and intense with neutral ones as the least. Arousal ratings for sad faces were significantly lower compared with both fearful and happy ones. (see Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nHowever, no significant associations were found between explicit face emotion recognition accuracy or RTs or recognition memory for faces or arousal or intensity ratings and ASQ scores (see  ). \n\n\n### Findings from MVPA analyses \n  \nThe SVR-based MVPA analysis revealed activity patterns of the right midbrain (extending into limbic areas) comprising the ventral tegmental area (VTA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus (MNIxyz = 3\/\u22123\/\u221218,   k  \u2009=\u200940), the left anterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221239\/57\/\u22129,   k  \u2009=\u200911), left caudate (MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u22123\/\u22126\/0,   k  \u2009=\u200920), right dorsal medial frontal cortex (dmPFC; MNIxyz = 3\/42\/42, k\u2009=\u200912), left postcentral gyrus (PoCG; MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221245\/\u221233\/51,   k  \u2009=\u200945), and the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221221\/63\/0,   k  \u2009=\u20096) could accurately predict individual autistic traits during processing of angry (versus neutral) expressions (Fig.  ). Additionally, during processing fear (versus neutral) expressions, individual autistic trait scores could be decoded from activity in the left MFG (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u221236\/18\/42,   k  \u2009=\u20098) (Fig.  ). Individual autistic-trait scores could also be decoded from neural activity towards sad (versus neutral) expressions in the left MFG (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u221236\/24\/33,   k  \u2009=\u20097), the right midbrain (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u22123\/\u221230\/\u22129,   k  \u2009=\u200913), and left hypothalamus (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u22123\/\u22123\/\u221215,   k  \u2009=\u200930) (Fig.  ).    Results of MVPA analyses.  \nLocal brain regions that predict individual autistic traits revealed by MVPA analyses in   a   angry versus neutral,   b   fear versus neutral, and   c   sad versus neutral contrasts.

However, there were significant interaction effects of ASQ and genotype for rs2268491 and rs2254298 on FC during processing of angry expressions. \n\nExamination of rs2268491 genotype (T+\/T\u2212) \u00d7 ASQ score interactions revealed effects for the angry > neutral contrast in coupling of left OFC (seed,   x  \u2009=\u2009\u221239,   y  \u2009=\u200957,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u22129) with bilateral MCC (MNIxyz = 0\/\u22129\/45,   k  \u2009=\u200924, T\u2009=\u20095.11,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005;   pcorrected for number of significant face expressions  \u2009=\u20090.015) (Table  ). Parameter estimates from the significant clusters extracted to visualize interaction effects found opposite effects of ASQ scores on FC strengths in the T+ and T- groups. Pearson tests (  p   values Bonferonni corrected for the number of SNPs and alleles i.e. 4 \u00d7 2\u2009=\u20098) revealed a positive association between ASQ and the FC strength in the T- group and a negative association in the T+ group (T-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.318,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.004; T+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.321,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.005) (Fig.  ). Additionally, ASQ and rs2268491 interactively impacted FC strengths between the right midbrain (seed, x\u2009=\u20093, y\u2009=\u2009\u22123, z\u2009=\u2009\u221218) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (MNIxyz = 63\/\u221239\/30,   k  \u2009=\u200914,   T  \u2009=\u20094.92,   p  \u2009=\u20090.012,   pcorrected for number of significant face expressions  \u2009=\u2009  0.036)   (Table  ). Parameter estimates were subsequently extracted and showed a positive association between ASQ and the FC strength in the T\u2212 group but negative association in the T+ group (T\u2212:   r  \u2009=\u20090.263,   pcorrected   for number of SNPs and alleles = 0.035; T+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.356,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.011) (Fig.  ).   \nFC modulated by OXTR genotype during processing of angry > neutral face emotion. \n  \nStatistical significance thresholding was applied with whole-brain peak level at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a minimum voxel size of   k  \u2009>\u200910.

Parameter estimates were extracted and further revealed opposite effects of ASQ on these two couplings in A+ and A- carriers. ASQ was positively associated with the left OFC - left MCC coupling in A- carriers while A+ carriers exhibited a negative correlation (A-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.329,   pcorrected   for number of SNPs and alleles = 0.003; A+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.311,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.006) (Fig.  ). Likewise, for A- carriers there was a positive correlation between autistic trait scores and left OFC - right MCC coupling but a negative correlation was in A+ carriers (A-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.399,   pcorrected  \u2009<\u20090.001; A+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.247,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.032 one-tailed) (Fig.  ). \n\nNo significant interaction effects were observed for other seeds nor during processing fear or sad expressions. The analyses for SNPs rs53576 and rs2268498 did not yield any significant effects. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study aimed to identify the neural pattern predictive of autistic traits during processing of different emotional faces and potential modulatory effects of OXTR genotype. There were no associations between trait autism and either implicit or explicit face emotion recognition accuracy. However, the SVR-based MVPA identified activity patterns that strikingly predicted individual autistic traits during processing of angry emotional expressions in regions involved in emotion, reward and salience, but not in early visual, processing. As such, they indicate that higher autistic traits tend to impact the \u2018extended\u2019 rather than the \u2018core\u2019 face emotion processing system. A seed-based FC analyses revealed that two OXTR SNPs (rs2254298, rs2268491) showed a modulatory effect on OFC-MCC coupling during processing of angry faces. Overall, these findings indicate that trait autism is predicted from extensive altered patterns of neural activity and reduced responses during processing of angry expressions in motivation, reward and salience processing networks. The association between FC of the OFC and MCC and angry faces is also OXTR genotype-dependent. \n\nAlthough we found overall evidence for negative emotional expressions influencing recognition accuracy of sex and emotion expression as well as arousal and intensity ratings, there was no evidence for associations between implicit or explicit face emotion recognition performance and ASQ scores. This is in line with a number of studies comparing autistic and neurotypical individuals [ \u2013 ], although other studies have either reported general impairment across face expressions or for negative or positive emotions in ASD [ ,  ]. Overall, the absence of any significant association between face emotion recognition and trait autism may reflect our use of a dimensional approach, but it should also be noted that discrimination accuracies were very high (>90% except for fear), and associations with trait autism might have been revealed with an increased task difficulty (see [ ]). Another possibility is that autistic traits have less of an effect on discrimination\/decoding of emotional faces and more on subsequent cognitive and emotional processing. The absence of any associations between trait autism and responses to emotional faces in early visual processing regions may support this interpretation. \n\nThe SVR-based MVPA revealed whole-brain neural representative relevant for autistic traits across all negative face emotion expressions, although particularly for anger. Trait autism scores were predicted by patterns across a wide network of cortical and subcortical regions engaged in the \u2018extended\u2019 face emotion network including those involved in emotion, motivation, reward and salience processing. Predictive patterns were mainly found in limbic regions (hypothalamus), the social salience system (ACC) and most notably fronto-basal ganglia-midbrain reward systems (dmPFC, SFG, MFG, OFC, caudate and VTA). The MVPA thus revealed evidence for their spatial patterns of activity being predictive of dimensional autistic traits. Notably, the MVPA was not predictive of trait autism in the \u201ccore\u201d occipital and temporal cortex face emotion processing systems. This supports the conclusion that later cognitive rather than early visual processing of angry faces is sensitive to autistic traits. \n\nDiminished patterns of activation and responses to angry faces associated with higher autistic traits in limbic regions may indicate reduced processing of threatening emotional stimuli [ ,  ]. However, our MVPA analysis only revealed hypothalamic rather than amygdala spatial patterns predicted autistic traits. The hypothalamus, is involved in emotion processing [ \u2013 ], can function as a valence detector and modulator [ ,  ] and is highly connected with the hippocampus and amygdala [ \u2013 ]. Hypothalamic morpho-functional differences have also been reported in ASD [ ]. \n\nThe ACC in the brain salience network was also predictive of trait autism during the processing of angry faces suggesting that higher autistic trait individuals perceive threatening stimuli as less salient. The ACC plays a central role in processing subjective evaluation and emotional salience-associated with cognitive processing, executive control and self-awareness [ \u2013 ] and shows altered structure and function in ASD [ \u2013 ]. Two recent electroencephalography studies have also reported differences in cingulate and other cortical responses to angry faces in individuals with ASD both in terms of patterns of synchronization associated with symptom severity [ ,  ] and evoked potentials in cingulate and other cortical regions, potentially indicating impaired salience processing. \n\nThe ability of patterns of activation in fronto-basal ganglia circuitry to predict autistic trait scores is in line with the \u201cDopamine Theory of ASD\u201d [ ,  ]. According to this theory, the dysfunctional midbrain dopaminergic system which projects to the prefrontal cortex and striatum via both mesocorticolimbic (MCL) and nigrostriatal (NS) circuits leads to impaired reward processing and motivation-related behavior along with altered goal-directed motor behavior and habitual behavior, contributing to core behavioral features of ASD. Although fronto-basal ganglia circuitry plays an important role in reward and motivation, it also transmits signals related to salient, but non-rewarding, experiences such as aversive and alerting events and thus additionally plays a crucial role in motivational control of either approach or avoidance behavior [ ]. Individuals with ASD tend to have greater problems in recognizing angry expression faces rather than other emotions independent of alexythmia [ ] and children with ASD exhibit an attentional bias away from angry faces at long presentation rates with greater avoidance being associated with greater social communication difficulties [ ]. Thus, in ASD, the basic pre-dispositional mechanisms to allocate attention quickly towards angry faces may be weaker [ ]. However, given that we only found patterns of activation in response to angry faces were predictive of autistic trait scores in the \u2018extended\u2019 rather than the \u2018core\u2019 face processing network this would tend to support the argument that greater autistic symptoms may primarily lead to altered interpretation and responses to angry faces rather than simply to reduced attention towards them. Indeed, in our behavioral analyses accuracy and response times for identifying the sex of face emotions did not reveal any problems specific to angry emotion faces, again suggesting that participants did pay attention to them. Thus, avoidance of angry faces in ASD may have more to do with post-attentive cognitive and motivational processing. \n\nOur initial hypothesis that OXTR genotype would influence associations between functional connectivity in neural circuitry identified by the MVPA as predictive of autistic traits was supported, in line with previous findings [ ]. The intrinsic FC of OFC-MCC and midbrain-SMG was dependent upon both autistic traits and OXTR genotype (either rs2254298 or rs2268491) for responses to angry faces. Carriers of the risk alleles of the SNPs (A+ or T+) associated with social cognition dysfunction and ASD [ ,  ,  ] showed reduced FC in individuals with higher autistic trait scores but increased connectivity in those carrying the non-risk allele (A- or T-). The neural coupling of OFC to MCC may be involved in reward and motivation processing given that the MCC is known to play a critical role in both reward [ ,  \u2013 ] and emotion [ ,  ] processing. Connectivity between midbrain and SMG may also play an important role in emotion processing [ ], especially for the negative emotions [ ,  ]. Both SMG and MCC are critical for social functioning in the context of ASD such as empathic processing [ ,  ,  ] and self-other distinction [ ,  ] and may contribute to representation and integration of internal and emotional feeling states. A previous study has also reported a genotype \u00d7 autism symptom interaction for SMG responses during face emotion recognition for rs2254298, rs2268491and rs53576 OXTR SNPs [ ]. The OXTR SNPs rs2268491and rs2254298 exhibit high linkage disequilibrium (LD) [ ,  ] which may explain their common modulatory effects. \n\nThere are some limitations to be noted. Firstly, the study adopted a dimensional approach using only neurotypical individuals and measurement of trait autism using the ASQ and findings should be confirmed in a clinical ASD population. Secondly, due to current limitations of the MVPA model used, we were unable to investigate whether autistic trait scores and OXTR genotype interactions could predict neural patterns in response to emotional faces. Thirdly, for the functional connectivity analysis we only investigated effects of four OXTR SNPs and other OXTR SNPs might have revealed additional influences on functional connectivity. Lastly, although we hypothesized the potential relevance of our findings to the \u201cdopamine theory\u201d or reduced reward processing in ASD we did not specifically quantify changes in dopamine or dopamine receptors in reward processing regions. \n\nIn conclusion, we used a validated implicit emotional face recognition task and dimensional approach in a large cohort of neurotypical individuals to demonstrate extensive evidence for patterns of neural responses to angry (threatening) faces in individuals which could predict autistic trait scores across \u201cextended\u201d face emotion processing networks involved in emotion, motivation and reward and salience but not in \u2018core\u2019 early visual processing ones. Functional connectivity changes in the identified reward (OFC - MCC) and emotion (midbrain - SMG) processing networks during angry face processing were dependent upon OXTR genotype. One of the overall implications of these findings may be that individuals with ASD process threatening face expressions, such as anger, differently and potentially in a way that could lead to inappropriate responses. Given that even neurotypical individuals show altered patterns of neural responses to threatening emotional faces in cognitive and emotion processing regions which predict their level of autistic traits this may provide a potential neural diagnostic biomarker for ASD. However, this needs to be established in future studies investigating patterns of neural processing of emotional stimuli in individuals diagnosed with ASD and it may also be important to consider the modulating influence of OXTR genotype. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10980722,"text_md5":"914b1327f9707e09d59153ed9504c3fc","field_positions":{"authors":[0,212],"journal":[213,230],"publication_year":[232,236],"title":[247,391],"keywords":[405,439],"abstract":[452,2195],"body":[2204,40202]},"batch":2,"pmid":38553454,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-024-02889-w","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10980722","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10980722"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10980722\">10980722<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10980722  Patterns of neural activity in response to threatening faces are predictive of autistic traits: modulatory effects of oxytocin receptor genotype"}

While some studies have explored the neural underpinnings of order processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging, our understanding of electrophysiological correlates is comparatively limited. To address this gap, we used a three-item symbolic numerical order verification task (with Arabic numerals from 1 to 9) to study event-related potentials (ERPs) in 73 adult participants in an exploratory approach. We presented three-item sequences and manipulated their order (ordered vs. unordered) as well as their inter-item numerical distance (one vs. two). Participants had to determine if a presented sequence was ordered or not. They also completed a speeded arithmetic fluency test, which measured their arithmetic skills. Our results revealed a significant mean amplitude difference in the grand average ERP waveform between ordered and unordered sequences in a time window of 500\u2013750 ms at left anterior-frontal, left parietal, and central electrodes. We also identified distance-related amplitude differences for both ordered and unordered sequences. While unordered sequences showed an effect in the time window of 500\u2013750 ms at electrode clusters around anterior-frontal and right-frontal regions, ordered sequences differed in an earlier time window (190\u2013275 ms) in frontal and right parieto-occipital regions. Only the mean amplitude difference between ordered and unordered sequences showed an association with arithmetic fluency at the left anterior-frontal electrode. While the earlier time window for ordered sequences is consistent with a more automated and efficient processing of ordered sequential items, distance-related differences in unordered sequences occur later in time. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPeople use integer numbers in their daily lives to describe both the number of elements (cardinality) as well as the order of elements (ordinality) of a given set [ ]. Numerical order processing pertains to the knowledge that numbers convey information about their relative rank or position within a sequence [ ,  ]. Many behavioral and neuroimaging studies have revealed the importance of numerical order processing for concurrent arithmetic skills in children [ \u2013 ] and adults [ \u2013 ], as well as its predictive value for future arithmetic skills [ ,  ]. Besides the well-known relevance of learning the correct order of number words for the development of arithmetic skills [ ], current research suggests that more sophisticated skills like arithmetic rely on a rich semantic network of numerical associations, and that ordinal processing is a key indicator of this development [ ]. However, our current understanding of the neural underpinnings related to ordinal processing is limited. While several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported distinct activation patterns in frontal and parietal cortex regions in children [ ,  ,  ,  ] and adults [ ], electroencephalography (EEG) might reveal complementary insights into ordinal processing due to its high temporal resolution. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only two relevant prior studies on electrophysiological correlates of ordinal processing. In one of these EEG studies, Turconi and colleagues [ ] manipulated numerical distance (the difference between two numbers) in two task conditions. In the ordinality condition, participants had to judge if a given number comes before or after 15, whereas in the magnitude condition, they had to decide if a number is smaller or larger than 15. Behavioral results revealed a canonical distance effect, a hallmark of cardinality processing [ ], in both conditions. This means that participants responded faster and more accurately when the distance between the two numbers was large rather than small. Likewise, the authors found similar activation patterns when analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) in both ordinal and magnitude conditions. However, the canonical distance effect in the magnitude condition was strongest over left parietal electrodes within a time window of 170\u2013210 ms after stimulus onset, whereas the effect occurred bilaterally in a slightly later time window of 210\u2013240 ms in the ordinal condition. These findings indicate that magnitude and ordinality processing share common neurophysiological mechanisms, but also seem to recruit specific networks for each task. However, since tasks in both conditions involved only two numbers, it is possible that participants used magnitude comparisons (as suggested by the canonical distance effect) in the ordinality condition and vice versa [ ]. \n\nSequences with three numbers prevent this potential issue and lead to specific behavioral characteristics of ordinal processing, such as the reverse distance effect [ ]. In this task, participants must decide if three presented numerals are ordered (e.g., 2\u20133\u20134) or unordered (e.g., 3\u20132\u20134). Response times and error rates show three characteristic behavioral patterns. \n\nFirst, ordered sequences are recognized faster and more accurately than unordered sequences, which might correspond to efficient verbal [ ] and visual-spatial representations of numbers [ ]. Some studies have associated individual differences in this pattern with arithmetic skills in children [ ,  ] and adults [ ]. \n\nSecond, ordered sequences with an inter-item distance of one (e.g., 2\u20133\u20134) are recognized faster and more accurately than ordered sequences with an inter-item distance of two (e.g., 2\u20134\u20136), which is known as the reverse distance effect [ ,  ,  ]. This effect can be found in children [ ] and adults [ ,  ,  ]. Although its precise nature is debated [ ], some evidence suggests that it may reflect efficient retrieval of familiar sequences from long-term memory [ ,  ,  ]. A reverse distance effect also emerges for other ordinal sequences such as the letters of the alphabet or months of the year (e.g., [ ,  ]). This finding helps to differentiate it from the canonical distance effect associated with magnitude processing, because non-numeric sequences only convey positional information. \n\nWhen examining associations with individual differences in arithmetic skills, some studies have found a relationship with the reverse distance effect [ ,  ,  ], whereas other studies have failed to provide evidence for such a connection [ ,  ,  ]. One possible explanation for this inconsistency might be that individuals process ordered sequences with different strategies, as not all individuals exhibit a reverse distance effect (some even show a canonical distance effect) when processing ordered sequences [ ]. \n\nThird, unordered sequences with an inter-item distance of two (e.g., 4\u20136\u20132) are recognized faster and more accurately than unordered sequences with an inter-item distance of one (e.g., 3\u20134\u20132). This canonical distance effect indicates that processing unordered sequences might be related to an iterative mental comparison of number magnitudes [ ]. To our knowledge, there are no reports of significant associations between the canonical distance effect in unordered sequences and arithmetic skills. \n\nOverall, much of our existing knowledge about ordinal processing is linked to the three-item order verification task [ ,  \u2013 ,  ], suggesting that several different components are involved in this task. This is reflected by the reverse distance effect as a marker for efficient retrieval of positional information in ordered sequences, as well as the canonical distance effect as a correlate of magnitude processing in unordered sequences. \n\nAs far as we know, only Rubinsten et al. [ ] have employed this three-item task to investigate electrophysiological correlates of ordinality processing in adults. In particular, they used a non-symbolic variation with three dot arrays instead of numerals and manipulated the following properties: ordered vs. unordered, the numerical ratio between neighboring sequences of 0.3 vs. 0.6, and ascending vs. descending order. Behavioral results showed that participants recognized ordered sequences faster than unordered sequences. They also identified descending sequences faster than ascending sequences, potentially because participants were native Hebrew speakers (the language is written from right to left). ERP results revealed significant peak amplitude differences between conditions in three time windows. First, the authors found a larger positive amplitude for ordered sequences compared to unordered sequences at right parietal and lateral occipital electrode sites in a time window of 80\u2013130 ms post stimulus. Such early effects are usually attributed to differences in stimulus parameters such as luminance and spatial frequency, but the authors argue that their finding could also reflect an early process related to automatic non-symbolic order estimation. Second, they found a larger positive amplitude for dot arrays with a numerical ratio of 0.6 as compared to dot arrays with a numerical ratio of 0.3 at medial posterior electrodes between 130\u2013200 ms. Third, the authors observed a larger negative amplitude for descending compared to ascending sequences at left frontal and left parieto-temporal electrodes between 300\u2013600 ms. \n\nAlthough non-symbolic processing is informative about general aspects of ordinality processing mechanisms, it is unclear if the observed results also translate to ordinal processing of numerals. Indeed, dot arrays elicit different behavioral characteristics as compared to numerals. For example, the reverse distance effect is a well-established finding in numerical order processing, but it is entirely absent when processing the order of dot arrays [ ]. \n\nAgainst this background, our study had two primary objectives. First, we sought to identify electrophysiological markers of symbolic numerical ordinality processing using the three-item order verification task. Second, provided that we could find such correlates, we aimed to investigate their associations with individual differences in arithmetic fluency. Beyond these goals, we wanted to explore distance effects of ordinality processing related to our ERP findings. We also set out to reproduce behavioral findings related to the order verification task, that is, a reverse distance effect for ordered sequences with distances of one and a canonical distance effect for unordered sequences for both response times and solution accuracies. \n\nFor this purpose, we recorded EEG signals from a group of healthy adults solving a three-item symbolic numerical order verification task. This enabled us to identify ERP components associated with central characteristics of symbolic ordinal number processing. Based on related prior literature, we expected to find differences between ordered and unordered sequences as well as interactions with numerical distance. \n\nPrior studies differed substantially from our design. In particular, Turconi et al. [ ] used a two-item comparison task and Rubinsten et al. [ ] used non-symbolic dot arrays, whereas our study employed a three-item symbolic order verification task. Therefore, we did not have specific hypotheses regarding timing, electrode locations, or the sign\/direction of potential ERP mean amplitude differences. For this reason, we decided to pursue a data-driven exploratory approach, which means that we did not select time segments or channel locations a priori. Instead, we derived these parameters from peaks in the grand average ERP waveforms aggregated over all conditions and participants [ ]. We also collected data from a speeded paper-pencil arithmetic fluency task to test potential relationships of ERP markers with individual arithmetic skills. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Sample \n  \nOur sample consisted of 73 right-handed participants (44 female and 29 male) aged between 18 and 39 years (mean age 22.3 with a standard deviation of 3.3 years). Our exclusion criteria, which we defined prior to data collection, comprised left-handedness, age less than 18 years or greater than 40 years, neurological or psychiatric disorders, and people in high-risk groups for COVID-19. Originally, we obtained data from 80 participants, but we had to exclude seven recordings prior to data analysis for the following reasons: five datasets had severe data quality issues (extensive movement and\/or large technical artifacts), one participant had a brain lesion, and one participant had dyslexia. \n\nRecruitment for this study took place from December 18, 2020, to April 30, 2021. All participants gave prior written informed consent. We offered psychology students the option to receive course credit for their participation. The Ethics Committee of the University of Graz approved the whole study, and we performed all procedures in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe entire experimental session lasted for about two hours and consisted of several blocks. First, we informed participants about the motivation and main goals of our study, after which they gave written informed consent. Next, we collected sociodemographic data (sex, age, whether they had diagnosed neurological or psychiatric disorders and\/or diagnosed learning disabilities, and if they were part of a high-risk group for COVID-19). After that, participants completed the short version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Finally, they took part in two experimental blocks: a paper-pencil task to assess arithmetic fluency as well as a computerized order verification task [ ]. We presented these blocks in pseudo-randomized order (i.e., half of our sample started with the arithmetic fluency block, whereas the other half started with the order verification block). \n\nBefore starting the order verification task, we donned the head cap and active EEG electrodes, since we recorded EEG only during this part of the experiment. Before this experimental block started, participants worked on five practice trials to get familiar with the task, and they took a short break (approximately three minutes) after the first half of the EEG block. We instructed participants to respond as fast and as accurately as possible with their right index and middle fingers, which rested on one of the two keys of a response pad. We counterbalanced the assignment of key\/answer mappings by instructing half of the participants to use their index finger for \u201cordered\u201d and middle finger for \u201cunordered\u201d responses, while the other half used their middle finger for \u201cordered\u201d and index finger for \u201cunordered\u201d responses. In the next sections, we describe our instruments and stimulus material in more detail. \n\n\n### Psychometric tests and instruments \n  \nWe used a German translation of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Participants had to indicate their dominant hand for ten different common tasks (e.g., using a toothbrush) by checking the appropriate column (left or right). If their preference for a hand was very strong, they could assign two checks. If they were indifferent, they checked both columns. We summed all checks for each column, yielding column sums   L   and   R  . The laterality quotient, calculated as (  R   \u2212   L  ) \/ (  R   +   L  ), distinguishes between left-handedness (a score less than \u221240%), right-handedness (a score greater than 40%), and ambidexterity (a score between \u221240% and 40%). \n\nThe arithmetic fluency paper-pencil task [ ] measures how quickly individuals solve arithmetic problems within a given time limit. The first subtest consists of easy problems, namely 64 multiplications (e.g., 5 \u00d7 7), 128 additions (e.g., 4 + 7), and 128 subtractions (e.g., 16 \u2212 8), with a time limit of 90 seconds per operation. The second subtest consists of more complex problems, namely 60 multiplications (e.g., 39 \u00d7 5), 60 additions (e.g., 30 + 98 + 59), and 60 subtractions (e.g., 82 \u2212 31), with a time limit of 120 seconds per operation. The total number of correctly solved problems equals the individual arithmetic fluency score. \n\n\n### Stimulus material and trial definition \n  \nEach stimulus item of the computerized order verification task consisted of a sequence of three Arabic numerals from 1 to 9. Participants had to decide whether the presented sequence was ordered or not. In addition, we varied the following properties across items: the sequence could be numerically ordered or unordered; the distance (difference) between adjacent numbers could be either 1 or 2; and the sequence could be ascending or descending (only the first two numerals categorized unordered sequences as ascending or descending). \n\nAfter excluding sequences where the order can be determined from only the first two numerals instead of all three (such as 1\u20132\u20133 and 9\u20138\u20137), the final stimulus set consisted of 40 distinct items. We presented each unique item repeatedly (either 10, 12, or 20 times, depending on the condition), resulting in 60 sequences per condition and 480 sequences in total. For example, there are six unique sequences in the ordered\/distance 1\/ascending condition, so we presented each of these sequences 10 times. Similarly, there are five unique ordered\/distance 2\/descending sequences and only three unique unordered\/distance 2\/descending sequences, so we presented each sequence 12 and 20 times, respectively (  lists the complete stimulus set). We illustrate this 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 design with an example sequence for each combination in  . Note that we did not analyze direction (ascending vs. descending) in this study, so we collapsed these two levels into a 2 \u00d7 2 design with factors \u201corder\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d. \n   Examples of sequences for each combination of factor levels.      \nWe used PsychoPy [ ] for stimulus presentation (black text on white background) as well as for recording response times.   illustrates the timing of a trial in the main experiment. First, a fixation cross appeared for one second, followed by a sequence of three single-digit numbers. The stimulus disappeared after one second or the participant\u2019s response, whichever occurred earlier. We recorded responses up to two seconds after stimulus onset. A trial ended with one additional second of a blank screen. The total length of each trial was therefore four seconds. We recorded response times as well as correctness of each trial. When analyzing average response times, we only considered correctly solved trials. \n   Timing of a trial.  \nThe dotted vertical line indicates a response, after which the stimulus disappeared. Participants had a maximum of two seconds to respond with a keypress (gray background). The sequence stayed on the screen for a maximum of one second. \n  \n\n### Recording setup \n  \nParticipants sat in a comfortable office chair in front of a 24-inch flat screen monitor with a resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1080 and a refresh rate of 120 Hz. They pressed one out of two keys on a Cedrus RB-740 response pad to indicate whether the presented sequence was ordered or not. In addition to measuring response times, we used a Biosemi ActiveTwo amplifier to record the EEG with 64 active electrodes arranged in the extended 10\u201320 system. Reference and ground electrodes were placed to the left and right of channel POz, respectively. The amplifier also recorded response pad events through its trigger interface. We recorded all signals with a sampling frequency of 512 Hz, and for EEG channels we set a low-pass edge frequency of 104 Hz and no high-pass filter. \n\n\n### EEG analysis \n  \nWe used MNE-Python [ ] to analyze EEG data in all processing stages. First, we inspected time series and power spectral densities across all 64 channels to manually identify and remove electrodes containing an excessive amount of noise, large artifacts, or no signals of interest (due to weak contact with the scalp surface). We then re-referenced the remaining channels to their average activity. After that, we interpolated missing channels using spherical splines. \n\nNext, we visually inspected EEG signals within epochs defined as 250 ms before and 750 ms after stimulus onset. We marked all segments containing artifacts such as muscle activity or movement artifacts. In our subsequent analyses, MNE-Python automatically excluded all epochs containing artifact annotations. \n\nFinally, we used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove ocular artifacts such as eye blinks and eye movement [ ]. In particular, we first applied a high-pass filter at 1 Hz, performed ICA based on time points within epochs (but excluding manually marked artifact segments), and manually selected components representing ocular activity based on topographic mappings, power spectral densities, and time courses. We identified between one and three ocular components for each participant, which we set to zero. Lastly, we back-projected the remaining components, which resulted in clean, artifact-free EEG signals. \n\nBased on the preprocessed clean EEG data, we first segmented the continuous signals into epochs (as previously mentioned, an epoch started 250 ms before and ended 750 ms after stimulus onset). We used the 250 ms time window before stimulus onset as our baseline. Because we had no strong prior hypotheses on the location and\/or timing of relevant ERP components, we implemented a collapsed localizer approach [ ]. This means that we selected segments around peaks based on the grand average waveform over all conditions and participants, separately for each channel. \n\nAfter defining time segments of interest, we proceeded with computing channel-wise average waveforms for each condition of interest: ordered sequences, unordered sequences, ordered sequences with a distance of one, ordered sequences with a distance of two, unordered sequences with a distance of one, and unordered sequences with a distance of two. In all conditions, we included only correctly solved trials. This procedure resulted in six groups of channel-specific averages (ERPs) per participant for the following three contrasts: ordered vs. unordered sequences, distance 1 vs. distance 2 within ordered sequences, and distance 1 vs. distance 2 within unordered sequences. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe analyzed group-level contrasts for response times, logarithmic error rates (raw error rates are typically right-skewed, so we applied a log transformation), and mean ERP amplitudes for previously defined time windows. We used repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) with factors \u201corder\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d to statistically assess differences in group means. If the models revealed significant effects, we followed up with Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise   t  -tests. \n\nSince we had no prior hypotheses regarding discriminative channel locations or time segments, we decided to explore ERP results in a data-driven manner. Specifically, our goal was to identify electrode locations as well as time segments with the largest differences for each of the three contrasts. To assist with this selection, we created topographic plots by mapping average ERP differences within a specific time segment across all channels. That way, we picked between two and three electrodes at the center of clusters with the largest difference values. We also took magnitudes of differences into account and selected only electrodes showing meaningful activities. After identifying electrodes and time segments, we performed one-sample   t  -tests (one for each electrode in a particular time segment) to determine if a difference deviated significantly from zero or not. \n\nFinally, we correlated individual arithmetic fluency scores with behavioral measures (response time and error rate) as well as with average ERP amplitudes in the previously identified channel locations and time segments. \n\nFor statistical analyses, we used R with packages afex (repeated measures ANOVA), effectsize (partial   \u03b7  , or   \u03b7  ), and emmeans (marginal means and pairwise post-hoc tests) in addition to dplyr, ggbeeswarm, ggplot2, glue, patchwork, purrr, readr, stringr, and tidyr for data wrangling and plotting. \n\n\n### Open data policy \n  \nOur analyses are fully reproducible, because all data sets and analysis scripts are publicly available on OSF ( ). The repository contains detailed instructions on how to run the scripts. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Response time \n  \nWe only used correctly solved trials to derive response time results. Furthermore, we found no differences between the two counterbalanced key\/answer mapping groups, so we will ignore this factor in all subsequent analyses (see   and   Tables).   illustrates mean response times for ordered sequences, which were 0.98 s (for both distance 1 and distance 2), as well as for unordered sequences, which were 1.14 s (distance 1) and 1.04 s (distance 2). \n   Average response times.  \nFrom left to right: 0.98 s (ordered distance 1), 0.98 s (ordered distance 2), 1.14 s (unordered distance 1), and 1.04 s (unordered distance 2). Large green dots indicate response times for distance 1 sequences, whereas large orange diamonds indicate response times for distance 2 sequences. Smaller points indicate mean response times for individual participants. \n  \nWe analyzed response time data with repeated measures ANOVA using within-subject factors \u201corder\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d. The model yielded significant main effects of \u201corder\u201d (  F  (1, 72) = 193.64,   \u03b7   = .73,   p   < .001) and \u201cdistance\u201d (  F  (1, 72) = 98.84,   \u03b7   = .58,   p   < .001) as well as a significant interaction (  F  (1, 72) = 188.53,   \u03b7   = .72,   p   < .001). A paired   t  -test on estimated marginal means of ordered vs. unordered confirmed our initial expectation that ordered trials are solved faster than unordered trials (with a difference of \u22120.109 s,   t  (72) = \u221213.915,   p   < .001). To further investigate the significant interaction, we conducted Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise   t  -tests on estimated marginal means as defined by the interaction. These follow-up tests yielded significant differences (  p   < .001) between all pairs except for ordered distance 1 vs. ordered distance 2. In particular, we did not find the expected reverse distance effect within ordered sequences (with a difference of \u22120.004 s,   t  (72) = \u22120.609,   p   = 1), whereas the canonical distance effect was present within unordered sequences (with a difference of 0.107 s,   t  (72) = 16.675,   p   < .001). \n\n\n#### Error rate \n  \nWe excluded missing responses and used only correct and incorrect responses when calculating error rates. Even though four participants had a relatively high percentage of missing responses (46%, 30%, 26%, and 22%), we decided to retain these datasets for subsequent analysis. The reason for this choice is that error rates were less than or equal to 10%, making them comparable to those of other participants. \n\nOverall error rates varied between 1% and 34% between individuals.   illustrates mean error rates for ordered sequences, which were 7.4% (distance 1) and 9.8% (distance 2), as well as for unordered sequences, which were 11.2% (distance 1) and 4.7% (distance 2). \n   Error rates.  \nFrom left to right: 7.4% (ordered distance 1), 9.8% (ordered distance 2), 11.2% (unordered distance 1), and 4.7% (unordered distance 2). Large green dots indicate mean error rates for distance 1 sequences, whereas large orange diamonds indicate mean error rates for distance 2 sequences. Smaller points represent error rates for individual participants. \n  \nA repeated measures ANOVA with logarithmic error rate as the dependent variable and within-subject factors \u201corder\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d yielded significant main effects of \u201corder\u201d (  F  (1, 72) = 18.41,   \u03b7   = .20,   p   < .001) and \u201cdistance\u201d (  F  (1, 72) = 32.81,   \u03b7   = .31,   p   < .001) as well as a significant interaction (  F  (1, 72) = 60.96,   \u03b7   = .46,   p   < .001). A paired   t  -test on estimated marginal means of ordered vs. unordered yielded a significant, albeit small, difference of 1.51% (  t  (72) = 4.29,   p   < .001). This means that ordered sequences were associated with slightly higher error rates than unordered sequences, which is not in line with our previous expectations. Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise   t  -tests on marginal means as defined by the interaction yielded significant differences (  p   < .001) between all pairs except for ordered distance 2 vs. unordered distance 1 sequences. This means that, in contrast to response times, we found both distance effects in error rates. Within ordered sequences, distance 1 sequences were associated with a lower error rate than distance 2 sequences (with a difference of \u22122.4%,   t  (72) = \u22123.612,   p   < .01), which is the expected reverse distance effect. We also found the canonical distance effect within unordered sequences, meaning that distance 1 sequences showed higher error rates than distance 2 sequences (with a difference of 6.5%,   t  (72) = 7.433,   p   < .001). \n\n\n\n### ERP data \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nOn average, we interpolated 5.3 \u00b1 2.6 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) bad channels per participant (individual channel selections are available in the data repository). Furthermore, we dropped 12.2 \u00b1 12.9 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) epochs (from a total of 480) per participant. \n\n\n#### Collapsed localizer \n  \n shows the grand average waveform computed across all participants and conditions for one representative channel PO8 (with clearly visible peaks). We used this average waveform to define the following time segments around positive and negative peaks: 85\u2013135 ms, 140\u2013190 ms, 190\u2013275 ms, 285\u2013475 ms, and 500\u2013750 ms. \n   Collapsed localizer on channel PO8.  \nThe black line corresponds to the grand average with the gray ribbon indicating its 95% confidence interval. Based on this waveform, we identified the following segments: 85\u2013135 ms, 140\u2013190 ms, 190\u2013275 ms, 285\u2013475 ms, and 500\u2013750 ms. \n  \n\n#### Ordered vs. unordered \n  \nWe found the largest differences between waveforms of ordered and unordered sequences in the last time segment (500\u2013750 ms). Specifically, there were three distinct clusters with differences greater than 0.5 \u03bcV at C2, AF7, and P9, respectively. All other time segments did not contain clusters of large differences.   illustrates these findings (see also  \u2013  Figs for additional visualizations of these differences). \n   Topographic difference maps of average amplitudes between ordered and unordered sequences.  \nThe first four time segments showed only small differences, whereas the last time segment between 500\u2013750 ms contains three distinct clusters of meaningful differences around C2, AF7, and P9. \n  \nWe conducted one-sample   t  -tests for each of the three channels to determine if the observed amplitude differences between ordered and unordered sequences differed significantly from zero. Indeed, differences at all three electrode sites were statistically different from zero, with a difference of 0.53 \u03bcV at C2 (  t  (72) = 4.84,   p   < .001), \u22120.80 \u03bcV at AF7 (  t  (72) = \u22124.19,   p   < .001), and \u22120.83 \u03bcV at P9 (  t  (72) = \u22124.52,   p   < .001). \n\n\n#### Ordered distance 1 vs. distance 2 \n  \nComparing distance 1 to distance 2 within ordered sequences yielded weaker and more diffuse clusters. We identified the third segment (190\u2013275 ms) to contain the largest differences at electrodes Fz and PO8 (see   and also  ). \n   Topographic difference maps of average amplitudes between distance 1 and distance 2 within ordered sequences.  \nThe third time segment between 190\u2013275 ms showed the largest differences in two distinct clusters around Fz and PO8. \n  \nOne-sample   t  -tests for each site resulted in a significant difference of 0.70 \u03bcV at PO8 (  t  (72) = 5.77,   p   < .001) as well as a significant difference of \u22120.30 \u03bcV at Fz (  t  (72) = \u22122.61,   p   < .05). \n\n\n#### Unordered distance 1 vs. distance 2 \n  \nThe same distance comparison within unordered sequences revealed the largest differences within the last segment (500\u2013750 ms). We identified two weak and diffuse clusters at electrodes AFz and F8 (see   and also  ). \n   Topographic difference maps of average amplitudes between distance 1 and distance 2 within unordered sequences.  \nThe last time segment between 500\u2013750 ms showed the largest differences in two clusters around AFz and F8. \n  \nThe mean difference at F8 was 0.94 \u03bcV, which was statistically significant (  t  (72) = 4.77,   p   < .001). The difference was smaller, albeit statistically significant, at AFz with \u22120.50 \u03bcV (  t  (72) = \u22122.52,   p   < .05). \n\n\n\n### Psychometric data \n  \nArithmetic fluency scores ranged from 98 to 347 with a mean of 194 and standard deviation of 55.2. Fluency correlated significantly with mean response time (  r   = \u2212.445,   t  (71) = \u22124.189,   p   < .001), but we found no significant correlation with error rate (  r   = \u2212.185,   t  (71) = \u22121.584,   p   = .118). \n\nWe also correlated arithmetic fluency with behavioral distance effects within ordered sequences, but neither response times (  r   = \u2212.115,   t  (71) = \u22120.975,   p   = .333) nor error rates (  r   = .020,   t  (71) = 0.169,   p   = .866) resulted in significant correlations. Distance-related response time differences within unordered sequences correlated significantly with arithmetic fluency (  r   = \u2212.249,   t  (71) = \u22122.168,   p   < .05), whereas there was no significant correlation for corresponding error rates (  r   = \u2212.136,   t  (71) = \u22121.155,   p   = .252). \n\nFurthermore, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients of arithmetic fluency versus mean amplitude differences (ordered vs. unordered) at previously identified electrode locations C2, AF7, and P9 for the time segment between 500\u2013750 ms. Whereas correlations at P9 (  r   = \u2212.159,   t  (71) = \u22121.355,   p   = .180) and C2 (  r   = .221,   t  (71) = 1.908,   p   = .060) were not significant, we found a significant correlation at AF7 (  r   = \u2212.282,   t  (71) = \u22122.475,   p   < .05). We did not find any significant correlations of the distance effects (mean amplitudes at previously defined electrode locations and time windows) in either ordered or unordered sequences with arithmetic fluency. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study has revealed, for the first time, specific ERP components associated with the three-item symbolic numerical order verification task, demonstrating their sensitivity to ordinality. We will expound upon potential interpretations and limitations of this finding, but we will start with the behavioral results (response times and error rates). \n\nWe could replicate established behavioral findings, namely both the canonical and reverse distance effects. Several previous studies have associated the reverse distance effect with ordinality processing. Specifically, participants are faster and more accurate in recognizing sequences with consecutive numbers (such as 3\u20134\u20135) than sequences with inter-item distances of two (such as 3\u20135\u20137) as ordered [ ]. However, we observed such a reverse distance effect only in error rates. That is, participants performed more accurately for an inter-item distance of 1 as compared to 2 (with error rates of 7.4% and 9.8%, respectively), but there was no significant difference in response times between the two distances (0.98 s in both conditions). This absence is in line with some previous findings, which failed to observe the reverse distance effect at either the group level or in certain individuals [ ,  ]. One reason for the absence of this effect could be variability on the individual level. In their sample of 397 participants, Vogel et al. [ ] found that 43% showed a reverse distance effect, 5% showed evidence for an opposite effect (i.e., a canonical distance effect), and 52% did not exhibit any distance effect at all. Variation in group compositions might therefore explain the overall presence or absence of the reverse distance effect. Another explanation could be that our stimulus set did not include the sequence 1\u20132\u20133, which is associated with the smallest processing time among ascending consecutive sequences [ ]. Therefore, the difference between distance 1 and distance 2 sequences tends to become less pronounced and can even be completely absent (not significant) [ ]. \n\nIn line with previous findings, we found a canonical distance effect in unordered sequences in both response times and error rates. In our study, participants recognized unordered distance 1 sequences more slowly and less accurately (1.14 s and 11.2% errors) than distance 2 sequences (1.04 s and 4.7% errors). In addition, participants recognized ordered sequences faster than unordered sequences. Assuming that they used more efficient strategies, such as memory retrieval, for consecutive ordered sequences, it appears that they tended to rely on slower magnitude comparisons for unordered sequences [ ,  ,  ], which explains the average difference in response times between ordered and unordered sequences. In this context, it is worth mentioning that somewhat unexpectedly, participants recognized unordered sequences more accurately than ordered sequences (8.0% vs. 8.6%). However, this is a small difference, driven mostly by the low error rate in unordered distance 2 trials (and in any case, the main effect of order is superseded by the significant interaction with distance). \n\nWe will now discuss the ERP correlates associated with the three central features of symbolic numeric order processing. First, when comparing ERP waveforms of ordered vs. unordered sequences, we found a significant difference in the time window of 500\u2013750 ms at three distinct electrode clusters centered around C2, AF7, and P9. At C2, the mean amplitude for ordered sequences was 0.53 \u03bcV higher than for unordered sequences, whereas it was 0.80 \u03bcV and 0.83 \u03bcV lower at AF7 and P9, respectively (see also   and   Figs). As far as we are aware, our study is the first to investigate ERP correlates related to symbolic ordinality processing using numerals, making direct comparisons with prior research challenging. For example, Rubinsten et al. [ ] used non-symbolic dot array triplets and found an effect of order as early as 80\u2013130 ms at right parietal and lateral occipital scalp electrodes. Although such early effects are usually associated with differences in stimulus parameters [ ], the authors argue that this difference could also be related to automatic non-symbolic order estimation. Our study revealed no such differences in early time windows around P1 (85\u2013135 ms) or N1 (140\u2013190 ms), indicating that stimuli did not differ across conditions in terms of visual properties such as luminance, size, spatial frequencies, and so on. While it is plausible that ordered and unordered sequences in dot arrays can be differentiated early and potentially also implicitly in the processing stream [ ], this might not be the case for symbolic stimuli. In contrast, our results indicate that accessing the meaning of ordered numerals occurs at a later time window and potentially engages different brain regions. \n\nThe second major result related to our ERP findings pertains to the reverse distance effect observed in ordered sequences. We found a significant, albeit small, effect of distance (i.e., distance one vs. distance two) in mean amplitude difference. This difference emerged 190\u2013275 ms post-stimulus at two electrode clusters centered around frontal (Fz) and right parieto-occipital (PO8) regions. So far, only one previous EEG study by Turconi and colleagues [ ] has found a distance-related effect for ordered numerals. In particular, the authors reported a distance effect over left parietal electrodes within a time window of 170\u2013210 ms for magnitude comparison, whereas the effect occurred bilaterally at parietal sites between 210\u2013240 ms in the ordinal condition. In contrast to our work, their study used a different task consisting of only two numerals, which might confound the interpretation of their ordinality judgment condition. Indeed, participants had to decide if the presented number is smaller or larger than 15 in their magnitude condition, whereas they had to report if the presented number comes before or after 15 in their ordinality condition. This ordinality task differs significantly from the three-item order verification task, which we employed in our study, and it is not unlikely that participants solved both conditions via magnitude comparisons. In fact, Turconi et al. [ ] found a canonical distance effect in behavioral data in both conditions, which provides support for this interpretation. \n\nIt is worth noting that the effect we found in our study occurred at an earlier time window than the previously discussed ordinality effect. In addition, its activation pattern is topographically quite different between the reverse and the canonical distance effects. In fact, the pattern of the reverse distance effect is rather focal compared to a more distributed pattern in the canonical distance effect (which we will discuss in the next paragraph). These dissimilarities point to differences in the way ordered and unordered sequences are processed. They are in line with previous findings from fMRI research, which has shown differential brain activation patterns between the two distance effects (e.g., [ ]). Additionally, these findings are also compatible with behavioral studies that have suggested a fast retrieval of ordered consecutive items compared to ordered items with a numerical distance of two. For instance, Vogel et al. [ ] showed that ordered consecutive items\u2013in particular ascending sequences\u2013facilitate non-numerical decisions (i.e., size judgements) in which the numbers are not relevant for the task (i.e., ordinal Stroop condition). Overall, we argue that the focal EEG correlates at this earlier time window are therefore consistent with the explanation of an automatic and efficient processing of ordinal sequences. \n\nFinally, the third ERP finding relates to the canonical distance effect in unordered sequences. We found a significant effect of distance within unordered sequences at 500\u2013750 ms post-stimulus at two electrode clusters centered around anterior-frontal (AFz) and right frontal (F8) regions. We are not aware of prior neuroimaging research (neither EEG nor fMRI) that has investigated the canonical distance effect within unordered sequences. This makes a direct comparison with existing findings challenging again. However, there are numerous functional neuroimaging studies that have investigated numerical magnitude processing within different experimental settings (e.g., number comparison, number adaptation, and ordinal processing tasks). These findings have provided converging and convincing evidence that brain activation patterns in the prefrontal and parietal lobe can be linked to the mental processing and manipulation (e.g., in the context of calculations) of numerical magnitudes (for reviews, see Nieder and Dehaene [ ] and Vogel and De Smedt [ ]). It is, therefore, possible that the frontal ERP effects observed in our work reflect numerical magnitude processing in the context of ordinal decisions [ ,  ,  ]. While our findings align with previous ERP studies that have identified frontal and parietal electrodes within different time windows ranging from 120 ms to 430 ms in the context of semantic processing (e.g., [ \u2013 ]) and from 350 ms to 900 ms in the context of stimulus and response conflict (e.g., [ ]), additional research is required to validate our findings and assumptions. \n\nWe will now discuss the relationship of electrophysiological correlates with arithmetic fluency. Our results revealed a significant negative correlation between arithmetic fluency and mean ERP amplitude of ordered versus unordered sequences in a time window of 500\u2013750 ms at AF7. All other correlations of fluency, especially with distance-related measures, did not significantly differ from zero. This is not entirely unexpected, because the association between arithmetic skills and distance-related measures is currently a topic of ongoing discussions. On the one hand, some studies have observed a significant relationship between the reverse distance effects in ordered sequences [ ,  ,  ], but on the other hand, several studies have failed to replicate this association [ ,  ,  ,  ]. As with the presence or absence of the reverse distance effect in some individuals, the presence or absence of a correlation with arithmetic fluency might be driven by differences in group composition. For instance, our own work has demonstrated that associations with arithmetic skills are significantly larger when restricting group analyses to individuals who show a significant reverse distance effect [ ]. Another explanation draws on the low reliability of behavioral difference score measures [ ]. Our knowledge about the association of the canonical distance effect in ordinal verification tasks and arithmetic is even more limited, because, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental work has investigated this potential link. Our data indicate that there might not be a relationship of the canonical distance effect with arithmetic fluency. This is surprising, because a number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have found significant correlations between numerical magnitude processing (i.e., the canonical distance effect in other tasks) and arithmetic skills (see a meta-analysis of Schneider et al. [ ]). In contrast, our results indicate that more general processing mechanisms might relate to arithmetic skills: both the ERP correlates of ordered versus unordered sequences and the overall response times correlated negatively with arithmetic fluency. This finding is in line with some of the results from the neuroimaging literature that has demonstrated an association between domain-general brain regions, such as the semantic control network [ ,  ,  ], and arithmetic skills. Our work thus raises the question to what extent domain-general and domain-specific factors of ordinality processing relate to arithmetic skills. \n\nFinally, we would like to discuss some limitations as well as highlight future research directions. First, we adopted an exploratory approach in our ERP analysis due to the lack of related prior studies. This means that we did not have strong prior hypotheses regarding the locations and time windows of ERP components sensitive to ordinality and\/or numerical distance. However, we were careful to avoid introducing bias in our analysis by using the collapsed localizer approach [ ]. Still, our results need to be interpreted cautiously, and follow-up studies to replicate these findings will be essential. \n\nSecond, the nature of the three-item ordinal verification task is debated, and some researchers argue that it might index familiarity with specific number sequences rather than ordinality processing [ ]. In particular, consecutive sequences might be more familiar, and therefore recognized faster and more accurately compared to sequences separated by an inter-item distance of two. However, familiarity with specific numbers and their ordinal structure might be defined as ordinal knowledge, which certainly plays a role in ordinality processing. However, an alternative task does not exist yet, and because numerous studies have used the three-item order verification task, we believe it is still interesting to determine any ERP correlates associated with this task. An active ordering task, where participants need to sort a number of items, is popular in behavioral studies, especially with children (e.g., [ ]), and might be employed in future EEG studies. \n\nThird, it is worth noting that we defined distance in unordered sequences relative to the first number, whereas distance in ordered sequences applies to both the first and second as well as the second and third numbers. For example, the unordered sequence 5\u20134\u20136 has a distance of one, even though the two inter-item differences are one and two, respectively. Similarly, we defined 5\u20137\u20133 to have a distance of two, with individual inter-item distances of two and four, respectively. This contrasts with ordered sequences, which have a constant inter-item difference of either one or two, depending on the condition. Despite this distinction, we maintain that our manipulation of numerical distance within unordered sequences remains appropriate and effective. \n\nFinally, we did not analyze ascending and descending directions separately, because the current design would have yielded an insufficiently small number of repetitions per condition required for averaging. Future work could investigate differences in ascending and descending trials with an appropriate design. \n\nIn conclusion, our study revealed ERP correlates sensitive to symbolic numeric order processing as measured by the three-item order verification task. We found differences between ordered and unordered sequences in mean amplitudes at left frontal, central, and left parietal sites in the 500\u2013750 ms time window. In addition, we identified distance effects for both ordered sequences at frontal and right parietal sites (between 190\u2013275 ms), as well as for unordered sequences at frontal locations in a 500\u2013750 ms window. This pattern suggests a fast and efficient processing of ordinal sequences that differs from the processing of unordered sequences. The potential association between arithmetic skills and ordinal processing remains an open question to be answered in future work. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10956805,"text_md5":"7127749dba86bfda83b2b80bfb46dc6c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,105],"journal":[106,114],"publication_year":[116,120],"title":[131,201],"keywords":[215,215],"abstract":[228,2099],"body":[2108,49801]},"batch":2,"pmid":38512938,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0301228","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10956805","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10956805"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10956805\">10956805<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10956805  Electrophysiological correlates of symbolic numerical order processing"}

This adult-oriented study assesses whether altered amygdala structure and function is present following low-risk preterm birth. T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images of 33 low-risk preterm (30\u201336\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA) and 29 full-term (37\u201342\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA) young adults of both sexes, aged between 20 and 32\u00a0years old, were analyzed using FreeSurfer (v6.0.0) and Coon Toolbox (v21.a). The social-emotional assessment included Happ\u00e9\u2019s Strange Stories Test, the Moral Judgment Test, Delay-Discounting Test, Adult Self Report, and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. No differences were found in social-emotional outcomes or amygdala volumes between the groups. Low-risk preterm young adults showed increased FC between the left amygdala, right amygdala and medial frontal cortex (MedFC) (  F  \u2009=\u20099.89,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.009) at cluster level compared to their full-term peers. However, significant results at connection level were not observed between left and right amygdala. Lastly, increased FC at cluster level between the right amygdala and MedFC, and left amygdala and MedFC, was related to better social-emotional outcomes only in low-risk preterm young adults (  F  \u2009=\u20096.60,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.036) at cluster level. At connection level, in contrast, only right amygdala\u2013MedFC increased FC was significantly associated with better social-emotional outcomes. This study reveals that low-risk prematurity does not have an effect on social-emotional outcomes or structural amygdala volumes during young adulthood. However, individuals who were considered to be at a lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations following preterm birth demonstrated increased FC between the left and right amygdala and MedFC. \n \n\n# Body\n \nPrematurity is defined as any birth before 37 complete weeks of gestation (WHO  ). Neonates suffering from subtle neurological abnormalities and perinatal comorbidities who were born low-risk preterm [30- to 36-week gestational age (GA)] make up the majority of preterm deliveries (Caravale et al.  ; Hart et al.  ). Moreover, most children born low-risk preterm exhibit a profile of cognitive and behavioral problems shared with children born at term predominantly with socioeconomic risk factors (Johnson et al.  ). However, brain alterations following low-risk preterm birth may be the cause of their plausibly unfavorable long-term neurodevelopment (Walsh et al.  ). In line with this, social-emotional functioning appears to be essential for optimal long-term neurodevelopment (Oberle et al.  ; Peralta-Carcelen et al.  ), especially since children and adolescents born moderate and late preterm are at higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems (Cheong and Doyle  ). \n\nEmotional symptoms (e.g., often unhappy, downhearted, etc.) have been predicted by different brain volumetric values following very preterm birth (<\u200932-week GA), including amygdala structure (Liverani et al.  ). The amygdala is highly innervated by glucocorticoid receptors, and the peak of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor density occurs during the early postnatal weeks, making the newborn stage a time of increased susceptibility to stress (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). Following preterm delivery, structural alterations in the amygdala have been found at term equivalent age and childhood (Cismaru et al.  ; Mueller et al.  ). Moreover, the presence of altered amygdala functional connectivity (FC) following very preterm birth suggests that there is a different pattern of associations with social-emotional abilities (e.g., emotion regulation) compared to those born at term, which may point to a reduced degree of functional architecture maturation (Kanel et al.  ; Rogers et al.  ; Siffredi et al.  ). According to a study based on extremely preterm neonates, prenatal stress leads to a significantly reduced connection between the left amygdala and other areas when compared to those not suffering from such stress (Scheinost et al.  ). \n\nThe amygdala\u2013prefrontal cortex circuit is also impacted by negative experiences and stress (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). In the general population, early life stress has been linked to increased negative centromedial amygdala\u2013ventromedial prefrontal cortex connection (Miller et al.  ). Changes in the function of this circuit seem to have an effect on how emotions are regulated and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). For instance, greater exposure to pain-related stress in infants born low-risk preterm has been linked to disrupted developmental scores (Morag et al.  ). \n\nFrom a neurodevelopmental perspective, individuals\u2019 reactions to emotional events shift significantly from childhood to adulthood (Silvers et al.  ). The amygdala\u2013prefrontal brain circuit continues developing until early adulthood despite the fact that amygdala reactivity diminishes during aging (VanTieghem and Tottenham  ). However, in preterm populations, although decreased amygdala volume and altered FC have been described, only social functioning (e.g., increased social difficulties, heightened levels of anxiety and depression, reduced extroversion, and poor self-esteem) correlates with altered amygdala\u2013posterior cingulate FC, with no structural associations shown during adulthood (Johns et al.  ; Schmitz-Koep et al.  ). In fact, due to functional changes in key emotion processing brain networks, including suboptimal amygdala modulation, adults born very preterm continue to exhibit subtle abnormalities in emotion recognition (Papini et al.  ). Nevertheless, there are still no data available concerning low-risk preterm samples. \n\nDeficits of social-emotional abilities in those born preterm have a substantial influence on their quality of life and on the burden of healthcare in society (Linsell et al.  ; Raju et al.  ). Furthermore, atypical development of the amygdala subnuclei volumes together with its altered FC have been related to social-emotional abilities in children born very preterm (Mueller et al.  ). For this reason, and given the lack of studies that focus on those considered to be at lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations following preterm birth, this study aims to assess the different social-emotional profiles between young adults born low-risk preterm and their full-term counterparts. Besides, it aims to analyze amygdala structure and its FC with medial frontal cortex (MedFC) in young adults born low-risk preterm. Finally, the study seeks to evaluate the possible associations during young adulthood between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumes and FC (i.e., amygdala\u2013MedFC) following low-risk preterm birth. It was hypothesized that, based on the literature (Cheong and Doyle  ; Cismaru et al.  ; Mueller et al.  ), young adults born low-risk preterm would have reduced amygdala volumes and FC, as well as obtaining lower social-emotional scores, than the full-term controls. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty-two young adults in total (aged between 20 and 32\u00a0years) took part in this prospective observational cross-sectional study: 33 low-risk preterm (M \u2009=\u200925.33\u00a0years; SD \u2009=\u20092.92) and 29 full-term (M \u2009=\u200926.41\u00a0years; SD \u2009=\u20092.24) subjects. A group of preterm young adults at lower risk of exhibiting major disabilities was recruited at Cruces University Hospital (Barakaldo, Spain) by chain-referral sampling from September 2018 to April 2021. This group of 33 young adults born preterm at 30\u201336\u00a0weeks of gestation and with the following inclusion\/exclusion criteria were considered to be at lower risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes as previously reviewed by our research group (Fern\u00e1ndez de Gamarra-Oca et al.  ): (1) 30- to 36-week gestational age (GA), (2) absence of brain pathology identified by neonatal cranial ultrasound, (3) lack of substantial neonatal morbidity (i.e., congenital neurological, cardiac, respiratory or digestive malformations, necrotizing enterocolitis, or septic shock), and (4) ranging in age at time of evaluation from 20 to 40\u00a0years. A full-term group of 29 subjects was recruited, with the inclusion criteria for these participants being as follows: (1)\u2009>\u200937-week GA, and (2) ranging in age at time of evaluation from 20 to 40\u00a0years. The exclusion criteria for both low-risk preterm and full-term groups were a history of acquired brain injury, cerebral palsy or any other neurological impairment, congenital malformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Social-emotional assessment \n  \nSocial-emotional functioning was measured according to the following domains, with the instruments used to measure each domain being described below. All instrument scores (i.e., theory of mind and moral competence total scores, delay gratification ratio, internalizing and externalizing problem scores and cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression punctuations) were standardized by transforming them into   z  -scores to create a composite score to measure social-emotional functioning (henceforth referred to as social-emotional outcomes). Cronbach\u2019s alpha (reliability) coefficient was 0.78. \n\n Theory of mind   was measured using the Happ\u00e9\u2019s Strange Stories Test (Happ\u00e9  ) by selecting four of the original stories to represent a lie, white lie, misunderstanding, and pretense. The participant is asked to deduce the thoughts and intentions of the characters in each narrative. For example, in the mentalizing story involving a double bluff, a 2-point answer might be the prisoner tried to trick the army by telling the truth, and so the army will look on the opposite side to the one he says. A 1-point answer for the same story would demonstrate partial understanding: reference the results or a simple bluff. A 0-point answer would be incorrect, such as since the prisoner was afraid, he wanted to reveal the truth. \n\n Moral competence   was evaluated by means of the Moral Judgment Test (MJT) (Lind  ), characterizing the ability to make morally upstanding decisions and judgments in two dilemma situations\u2014the \u201cworkers\u2019 dilemma\u201d (i.e., refers to labor rights and professional ethics) and \u201cmercy killing dilemma\u201d (i.e., refers to euthanasia in a medical setting). The MJT specifically assesses the respondent\u2019s ability to score arguments (for and against a protagonist\u2019s action in a dilemma situation) in terms of moral quality rather than opinion agreement. For most participants, this is a tough task; only a few responders score greater than 40 on the C-scale from 0 to 100. \n\nThe Delay-Discounting Test (DDT) (Kirby and Marakovi\u0107  ), also called the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, assessed   delayed gratification   by participants answering 21 questions, such as the following: \u201cWould you rather have \u20ac85 in 14\u00a0days or \u20ac30 now?\u201d. \n\nThe Adult Self Report (ASR) was employed as a measure of   emotional-behavioral functioning   (Achenbach et al.  ). The questionnaire provides scores for the following scales: anxious\/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and intrusive behavior. Internalizing and externalizing problems were also obtained from the sum of these scales. \n\nThe 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) measures participant predisposition for both   cognitive reappraisal   and   expressive suppression   of their emotions (Gross and John  ). Participants respond to each item on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). \n\n\n#### General cognitive assessment \n  \nThe Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RPM) test was used to assess   analogical reasoning   as general non-verbal cognition (Raven and Court  ), while the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-III) was employed to measure   receptive language,   since it characterizes general verbal cognitive performance (Dunn and Dunn  ). \n\n\n#### Socioeconomic status (SES) \n  \nThe occupation and educational domains of participants and their parents were taken into account separately using the Hollingshead Index (Hollingshead  ). The participants\u2019   self-SES   (i.e., participants\u2019 ongoing occupation and highest level of education) and   familial SES   (i.e., the average of parents\u2019 retrospective occupation and highest level of education) were thus two distinct measures that were obtained. \n\n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \n3-dimensional MRI datasets were obtained from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit OSATEK, Galdakao Hospital (Galdakao, Spain) for 64 participants; however, two were eventually excluded due to difficulties in the acquisition process. The radiologist (J.M.O.) reported that all MRI images were non-pathological. Hence, there was a final sample of 33 low-risk preterm and 29 full-term young adults. A single session was used to acquire both sequences. T1-weighted images were also obtained from a Philips 3T Achieva dStream (axial orientation, 3\u00a0min 58.9\u00a0s session, 160 slices, TR\/TE\u2009=\u20098.1\/3.7\u00a0ms, 288\u2009\u00d7\u2009248 matrix, 8\u00b0 flip angle, 1\u00a0mm slice thickness, no gap), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was also acquired: 8\u00a0min session, 315 whole-brain gradient echo-planar images, 44 axial slices, TR\/TE\u2009=\u20091500\/30\u00a0ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009132\u00a0mm , and voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u00a0mm . \n\nBefore acquiring rs-fMRI, the participant\u2019s head was restrained from movement and protected from scanner noise using foam padding and earplugs. Subjects were told not to perform any specific cognitive or physical tasks, keep their eyes closed, and avoid falling asleep. After scanning, participants completed the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) (Alexander Diaz et al.  ), which is a 27-item self-report survey covering seven dimensions of   resting-state cognition   (i.e., discontinuity of mind, theory of mind, self, planning, sleepiness, comfort, and somatic awareness). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \n#### Whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes \n  \nFreeSurfer ( ) (version v6.0.0) was used in order to obtain whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes from 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans (Fischl  ). T1-weighted image processing included several procedures: intensity non-uniformity correction, skull stripping, affine transformation to an MNI template, intensity normalization, removal of non-brain tissue, linear and non-linear transformations to a probabilistic brain atlas, and the labeling of subcortical\/allocortical structures. Spatial localization priors were used to determine the correct label voxel-per-voxel, and skull stripping, intensity normalization, white matter segmentation, and surface extraction errors were all manually corrected where necessary. Subsequently, the amygdala was segmented automatically based on the Saygin et al. ( ) atlas into central, lateral, basal, accessory basal, cortical, medial, and paralaminar nuclei, as well as into the corticoamygdaloid transition area and anterior amygdaloid area. \n\n\n#### Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) \n  \nFC analyses were carried out using the CONN Functional Connectivity Toolbox version 21.a (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon  ). Each subject\u2019s 315 functional images were realigned and unwarped, their slice-timing corrected, coregistered with structural data, spatially normalized into standard MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada), and their outliers detected (ART-based scrubbing; to eliminate any influence of outlier scans on the BOLD signal, noise components are employed as potential confounding effects). During outlier detection (intermediate level, 97th percentile: 0.9\u00a0mm 5\u00a0s.d.), potential outlier scans of frame-wise displacements\u2009>\u20090.9\u00a0mm or BOLD signal changes\u2009>\u20095\u00a0s.d. were detected and flagged as potential outliers. Finally, they were smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel full with half maximum (FWHM) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. No outliers were detected in this sample. The default preprocessing pipeline for volume-based analysis (to MNI space) was used for all preprocessing steps, and the structural data were normalized and segmented into GM, WM, and CSF. The anatomical CompCor method was used to reduce noise by extracting the principal components (5 each) from the WM and CSF time series. The subject\u2019s estimated motion parameters and other artificial effects, such as BOLD signals in WM and CSF, which were included as additional confounds, were then removed by a denoising process that was implemented using linear regression and band-pass filtering (0.008\u20130.09\u00a0Hz) (Weissenbacher et al.  ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical and imaging analysis \n  \nNormal distribution of data was assessed using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (K\u2013S), while the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in GA, and self- and familial SES. Furthermore, the Chi-squared test was required to assess differences in two qualitative sociodemographic characteristics: gender and handedness. Student\u2019s   t  -tests were also performed to compare birthweight (BW) and age at time of evaluation between the groups. \n\nA multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to compare different social-emotional domains (adjusted for age and self-SES), whole amygdala volumes (adjusted for age, self-SES, and eTIV), and amygdala subnuclei volumes (adjusted for age, self-SES, and left\/right amygdala volume), while partial eta squared was employed to calculate effect sizes; around 0.01 is considered a small size effect, 0.06 medium, and above 0.14 is considered large. Moreover, bivariate correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationships between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumes (i.e., whole and subnuclei volumetric values). For all preceding analyses, the SPSS version 28 was used, and significance level set at 0.05. \n\nRegarding FC statistical analysis, cluster-level inferences in region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses based on Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) approach was used (Smith and Nichols  ). This approach is used for thresholding ROI-to-ROI parametric maps while appropriately controlling the family-wise error (FWE) rate using TFCE analyses with a FWE corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at cluster level, with the post hoc test FDR corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at connection level. Between-group differences were assessed (with age and self-SES used as covariates) with Cluster-level ROI-to-ROI based on TFCE and the ROIs selected based on the Harvard\u2013Oxford Structures Atlas ( ) were as follows: (a) left amygdala, (b) right amygdala, and (c) MedFC. In addition, Pearson correlation analyses (i.e., each group independently) between the strength of FC and social-emotional data were also assessed with the same approach (Cluster-level ROI-to-ROI based on TFCE) and with the selected ROIs. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nNeonatal, sociodemographic, cognitive variables, and rs-fMRI mean movement are shown in detail in Table\u00a0 . As expected, there were significant differences in neonatal variables (GA and BW) between the groups. No differences were found in sociodemographic (i.e., sex, age, handedness, and familial SES), general cognitive measures (i.e., receptive language and analogical reasoning) or rs-fMRI mean movement between the groups, except in the case of the self-SES, with the low-risk preterm sample reporting lower scores. The following analyses will therefore be adjusted for self-SES together with specific covariates (see \u201c \u201d, Statistical analysis).   \nNeonatal, sociodemographic, and cognitive data \n  \nSignificant results are shown in bold \n\nNote:   SD   standard deviation,   GA   gestational age,   wks   weeks,   BW   birthweight,   g   grams,   yrs   years,   U   Mann\u2013Whitney U test,   t   Student   t  -test,   X   Chi-square test,   SES   socioeconomic status,   PPVT-III   Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III,   RPM   Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices,   rs-fMRI   resting-state functional MRI \n  \n\n### Aim 1: differences in social-emotional outcomes \n  \nIn terms of social-emotional functioning, as shown in Table\u00a0 , no differences were shown between young adults born low-risk preterm and full-term.

Specifically, young adults born low-risk preterm exhibited the following: (a) increased FC between the left amygdala and MedFC (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20092.93,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.014), and (b) increased FC between the right amygdala and MedFC (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20092.25,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.028) in comparison to their full-term peers. Nevertheless, no significant FC differences between the left amygdala and right amygdala (  T   (58)\u2009=\u20091.69,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.096) were observed between the groups.   \n Left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC FC differences between low-risk preterm and full-term young adults  .   Note  : Low-risk preterm young adults showed left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC FC differences at cluster level compared to the full-term group. The significant results obtained at connection level were   a   increased FC between the left amygdala and MedFC, and   b   increased FC between the right amygdala and MedFC. Results were displayed using CONN Toolbox 21.a and Jamovi 1.6.1 \n  \n\n\n### Aim 3: correlation analysis \n  \nNo significant correlations were found in the low-risk preterm group or full-term group between social-emotional outcomes and amygdala volumetric values (i.e., whole and subnuclei volumes). \n\nPositive correlations (  F  \u2009=\u20096.60,   p  -FWE\u2009=\u20090.036) were found at cluster level between the strength of left and right amygdala\u2013MedFC and social-emotional outcomes only in young adults born low-risk preterm. Specifically, right amygdala\u2013MedFC strength was positively related to social-emotional outcomes (  T   (31)\u2009=\u20092.64,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.038) in low-risk preterm young adults, albeit not in the full-term group. In other words, right amygdala\u2013MedFC increased FC was associated with better social-emotional outcomes in young adults born low-risk preterm (see Fig.\u00a0 ). However, specific to the low-risk preterm group, left amygdala\u2013MedFC strength did not correlate with social-emotional outcomes (  T   (31)\u2009=\u20091.91,   p  -FDR\u2009=\u20090.064). Moreover, no significant correlations were found between left and right amygdala FC strength and social-emotional outcomes in either group.   \nRight amygdala\u2013MedFC FC correlates with social-emotional outcomes in low-risk preterm young adults \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has assessed amygdala volume and its FC in young adults born preterm who are considered to be at lower risk of exhibiting neurodevelopmental alterations. Although low-risk preterm delivery had no effect on social-emotional outcomes or whole and subnuclei amygdala volumes during young adulthood in this sample, increased FC strength between left and right amygdala and MedFC was nonetheless found. The human brain is equipped with a high degree of specialization in processing social inputs, with control ranging from neurotransmitter to neural network level (Dunbar  ). In other words, an optimal social performance is sustained by a healthy development of the social brain (Galv\u00e1n  ). According to Kennedy and Adolphs ( ), the best approach to understanding the social brain, including its dysfunction and recovery, is through large-scale networks rather than discrete structures. In fact, similarly, children and adolescents born very preterm also have enhanced FC in and between networks involved in higher-order cognitive performance (Wehrle et al.  ). \n\n### Social-emotional outcomes \n  \nPrematurity has been deemed an independent risk factor with regard to psychiatric disorders; social-emotional problems are particularly prevalent in samples of individuals who were born very preterm (Montagna and Nosarti  ). For instance, Gilchrist and colleagues ( ) identified a different biological basis for externalizing problems in adolescents born very preterm. Equally, a higher risk of delayed social competence in the first 2\u00a0years of life has been associated with births between 32 and 36\u00a0weeks\u2019 GA (Cheong et al.  ; Johnson et al.  ). However, according to this study covering young adulthood, there is a lack of social-emotional impairment due to prematurity per se rather than other neonatal comorbidities excluded in the sample characterization. Comparable to our results, up to the age of 5\u00a0years, no specific preterm social phenotypes have been established (Dean et al.  ). \n\n\n### Amygdala structure and FC \n  \nEven while amygdala volume is lastingly reduced in heterogeneous preterm samples during both childhood and adulthood (Chau et al.  ; Schmitz-Koep et al.  ), our results displayed no differences in amygdala volumetric values following low-risk preterm birth in current sample. These findings are in line with Rogers\u2019 study targeting children born late preterm (Rogers et al.  ). Moreover, following very preterm birth, smaller right basal, medial, and cortical nuclei volumes have been linked to social-emotional problems during childhood (Mueller et al.  ). Meanwhile, increased right centromedial amygdala response to social-emotional events has been displayed in typically developing adolescents (Miller et al.  ). \n\nFurthermore, with a small GA, both reduced and elevated FC are established between the left amygdala and other areas during the adult stage (Papini et al.  ). Current findings show that assessed low-risk preterm young adults have an increased FC in the following three structures: left amygdala, right amygdala, and MedFC. In other words, FC was greater between left and right amygdala as well as between left and right amygdala and MedFC at cluster level following low-risk prematurity when compared to adults born full term. Nevertheless, as other studies have suggested, reduced strength between amygdalar and thalamic networks during childhood, as well as reductions in the intrinsic FC between the centromedial subdivision of the right amygdala and prefrontal cortex in young adults, may potentially underlie emotional deficits following very preterm delivery (Mueller et al.  ; Papini et al.  ). The results obtained from this study, however, did not support a different FC between left and right amygdala at connection level in these adults born low-risk preterm. \n\n\n### Amygdala structural and FC correlates with social-emotional outcomes \n  \nOur findings reveal no associations between whole or subnuclei amygdala volumes and social-emotional outcomes. Accordingly, no associations between reduced basolateral amygdala volumes and increased social anxiety in adults born very preterm have been found either (Schmitz-Koep et al.  ). In healthy developing young adults, in contrast, the experience of stress during the first half of pregnancy may have enduring effects on amygdala structure and may consecutively predict depressive symptoms (Mareckova et al.  ). Nonetheless, as mentioned above, rather than precise structures, networks may be what sustain social brain activity (Kennedy and Adolphs  ). \n\nLastly, this study indicates that both the right amygdala\u2013MedFC and left amygdala\u2013MedFC increased strengths at cluster level were related to social-emotional outcomes in assessed young adults born low-risk preterm. Higher FC between these areas is linked to optimal social-emotional adult functioning following low-risk prematurity. Likewise, better social-emotional abilities have been associated with improved engagement across different networks in children born very preterm (Siffredi et al.  ). However, increased amygdala\u2013ventral medial prefrontal brain FC has also been related to greater levels of sadness in typically developing infants (Thomas et al.  ), and less mature social-emotional functioning during adolescence has also been associated with positive frontoamygdala FC (Miller et al.  ). In other words, negative frontoamygdala FC has been deemed crucial in order to properly handle more demanding contexts concerning social-emotional processes (Callaghan and Tottenham  ). As per Gee and colleagues ( ), accelerated amygdala\u2013prefrontal development may be considered an ontogenetic adaptation in response to early adversity. Discrepancies found between studies could therefore be explained by different degrees of immaturity or by age-related improvements in emotion regulation caused by changes in activation and FC between prefrontal and amygdala circuits (Silvers et al.  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nUnlike previous studies, this study evaluated social-emotional outcomes and amygdala structure and its FC in low-risk preterm and full-term individuals during young adulthood. In other words, unlike previous studies using heterogeneous preterm samples, this study employed neonatal and sociodemographic data to attain comparable groups, thus improving generalizability in terms of results. However, there was no longitudinal follow-up from early childhood to young adulthood so as to determine whether social-emotional outcomes or amygdala structure and its FC were developing commonly or not over time. Another drawback is sample size, which limits the interpretation of these results (i.e., a small power of analysis encourages a type 2 error) as well as the estimation of any differences between sex. Furthermore, although FC between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is known to be critical for social-emotional functioning (Ochsner et al.  ), other areas or networks that may be involved (i.e., lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, among others) were not examined in this study. Lastly, we found a significant difference in self-SES with the low-risk preterm group obtaining lower scores. However, subsequent analyses were adjusted in the case of this variable. This finding resonates with results from other studies in which prematurity has been previously associated with a lower rate of job success during adulthood (Bilgin et al.  ; Kroll et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, according to the results obtained from this study, low-risk prematurity has no impact on social-emotional outcomes or amygdala volumes during young adulthood. This may suggest that preterm birth does not imply any atypical amygdalar development, since damage to it impairs the recognition of social emotions (Adolphs et al.  ). Nonetheless, such differences could be found in larger preterm-born samples, given the sample size of the current study that leads to a small power of analysis incrementing type 2 error. Moreover, whereas social-emotional difficulties have been demonstrated in the first years of life (Cheong et al.  ; Johnson et al.  ), an increase in amygdalar FC with MedFC was observed in the studied low-risk preterm sample during adolescence and young adulthood. However, additional research is needed to provide more data concerning brain FC development and its associations with social-emotional outcomes in larger low-risk preterm samples. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10917835,"text_md5":"d0c6d215cec63cafa6a6ac13c9d68ffa","field_positions":{"authors":[0,199],"journal":[200,218],"publication_year":[220,224],"title":[235,347],"keywords":[361,459],"abstract":[472,2321],"body":[2330,33277]},"batch":2,"pmid":38236400,"doi":"10.1007\/s00429-023-02749-1","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917835","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10917835"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917835\">10917835<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10917835  Amygdala structure and function and its associations with social-emotional outcomes in a low-risk preterm sample"}

Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 32 subjects: 16 healthy controls and 16 AD patients. All 16 AD patients underwent 6\u00a0months of donepezil treatment and received two MRI scans (pre- and post-intervention). Analysis of covariance and post hoc analyses were used to compare ReHo differences among the healthy controls, pre-intervention AD patients, and post-intervention AD patients. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine relationships between ReHo values in differential brain regions and clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, post-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and pre-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Pattern recognition models revealed that pre-intervention ReHo values in abnormal brain regions of AD patients were 76% accurate for predicting the efficacy of donepezil on cognitive function and 65% accurate for predicting its efficacy on depressive symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThese findings deepen our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of donepezil in AD patients, and provide a novel way to predict its clinical efficacy in such patients. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDonepezil hydrochloride is currently the first-line drug for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is widely used in the clinic because of its effectiveness against cognitive dysfunction, low side effects, good compliance, and high efficacy and acceptability [ ]. Donepezil may improve cognitive function in patients with AD by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase [ ], which is involved in cell development and maturation and can promote neuronal development and nerve regeneration [ ]. However, the mechanisms by which donepezil modulates brain function in AD patients, and thus interferes with clinical symptoms, remain unclear. \n\nIn recent years, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study the mechanisms of donepezil intervention in the AD brain [ \u2013 ]. An MRI-based structural imaging study revealed that donepezil slows the process of forebrain atrophy in AD patients compared with placebo [ ]. In contrast, after donepezil intervention, patients with mild cognitive impairment have increased putamen, globus pallidus, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) gray matter volume, but decreased hippocampal volume [ ]. A resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) study demonstrated increased orbitofrontal network connectivity in AD patients after a 12-week intervention with donepezil; orbitofrontal network connectivity was associated with cognitive improvement [ ]. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) has also been used to study the mechanisms of donepezil intervention in the AD brain. Cheng et al. [ ] explored changes in ReHo after donepezil intervention in 11 AD patients, and reported decreased ReHo in the right gyrus rectus, right precentral gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus after the intervention. However, their analysis did not correct for multiple comparisons and the sample size was very small. \n\nThe aim of the present study was to use rsfMRI to examine alterations in ReHo in AD patients after donepezil intervention compared with healthy controls (HCs). Based on previous studies of the brains of AD patients before and after donepezil-based interventions [ \u2013 ], we hypothesized that, relative to baseline status and the HC group, the post-intervention AD group would display altered ReHo in regions of the orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG) that are critical to cognitive and emotional regulation [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixteen subjects with mild or moderate AD completed this longitudinal study from January 2018 to July 2022 at Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. Subjects with AD met probable AD criteria according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines [ ]. Subjects were right-handed with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\u2009<\u200924, and\u2009>\u20096 years of education. Sixteen healthy subjects were recruited as HCs at Tongde Hospital. They had no cognitive impairment and a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0. Participants were excluded if they had the following conditions: a history of psychiatric disorders, were taking antidepressant drugs, or had MRI contraindications. All participants signed informed consent forms. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (2017-11-12). \n\nSeverity of depression was rated using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [ ] and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [ ]. Depressive symptoms were considered present when the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was\u2009\u2264\u20096 and the NPI depression domain score was\u2009\u2265\u20094 [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n### MRI scanning \n  \nA 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner with an eight-channel head coil (Siemens Magnetom Verio, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) was used. Axial functional images were obtained using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, slices\u2009=\u200933, thickness\u2009=\u20094.8\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u00a0mm, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, and flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u200990\u00b0. The fMRI process took 6\u00a0min and 40\u00a0s. High-resolution three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo T1-weighted imaging sequences were obtained using the following parameters: inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u2009900\u00a0ms, TR\u2009=\u20091900\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.48\u00a0ms, slices\u2009=\u2009128, thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, and FA\u2009=\u20099\u00b0. \n\n\n### Data processing \n  \nSPM12 ( ) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus V1.25 (RESTplus V1.25) ( ) were used for data preprocessing. The first ten volumes were removed, slice-timing was performed, and motion correction was applied. Participants had low head motion in terms of framewise displacement (mean\u2009<\u20090.5). We initially coregistered fMRI pictures to each person's high-resolution T1 anatomical scan and then normalized them to the MNI152 template before they were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space. Next, we performed linear detrending and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz). Cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and head motion artifacts were regressed out of each voxel's time series to eliminate spurious signals. \n\n\n### ReHo calculations \n  \nThe preprocessed images were then used to perform ReHo computation. Individual ReHo maps were created using Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance to determine the degree of resemblance between a given voxel's time series and that of its 26 closest neighbors. The ReHo maps were then normalized by dividing the value of each voxel by the global average. Finally, a Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u20096 mm) was used to spatially smooth the standardized mean ReHo maps. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical software was used to analyze demographic and clinical traits (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v.15.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Age and education differences were assessed using a two-sample   t   test, and sex distribution differences were assessed using the Chi-squared test. \n\nThe ReHo maps were compared voxel-by-voxel among the three groups using one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We then extracted brain masks that displayed significant differences in the ANCOVA analysis. Finally, we performed post hoc   t   tests between each pair of groups using the ANCOVA brain masks. The two-sample   t   test was used for the post hoc comparison of the AD and HC groups, and the paired   t   test was used to compare the pre- and post-intervention AD groups. We removed the mean relative head motion displacements of age and sex as covariates in the ANCOVA and   t   tests to ensure the accuracy of the results. With an individual voxel   p   value\u2009<\u20090.005 and a cluster size\u2009>\u200925 voxels, the significance level was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (AlphaSim-corrected for multiple comparisons). We used the REST Slice Viewer ( ) to display the differential brain regions and the Automated Anatomical Labeling 3 standard template was used as the reference standard for brain region localisation. \n\n\n### Relationship between ReHo values and clinical variables \n  \nWe extracted the mean ReHo values of abnormal brain regions and used Pearson correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between abnormal ReHo values and clinical variables in AD patients pre- and post-intervention (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n### ReHo-based efficacy prediction \n  \nWe developed pattern recognition models to evaluate the ability of ReHo values to predict the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD. Pre-intervention ReHo values in AD abnormal brain regions were used as input variables and post-intervention efficacy measures were used as output variables. Post-intervention efficacy was divided into two categories: cognitive function (assessed using the MMSE) and depressive symptoms (assessed using the NPI). When comparing MMSE scores pre- and post-intervention, \u0394MMSE\u2009>\u20090 was considered good cognitive function efficacy. For NPI scores, a 50% increase was considered good depressive symptom efficacy. We built the prediction model using the fitcnb and fitcknn functions of MATLAB 2019b with a fivefold cross-check. We then calculated the area under the curve to evaluate the accuracy of ReHo values for predicting intervention efficacy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neuropsychological results \n  \nDemographic and clinical data are shown in Table\u00a0 . There were no significant between-group differences in age, sex distribution, or educational attainment (  p  \u2009=\u20090.107, 0.157, and 0.240, respectively). Compared with HCs, the AD group had significantly lower MMSE scores and higher NPI scores (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001).   \nDemographic and neuropsychological data \n  \nData are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.

Compared with HCs, post-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the inferior frontal gyrus\/orbit part (IFG.orb) (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ), and pre-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the right IFG.orb (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions showing abnormal regional homogeneity values among the three groups.

Compared with HCs, AD patients had reduced ReHo in the IFG.orb. Moreover, pre-intervention ReHo values of abnormal brain regions in AD patients were 76% accurate for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention on cognitive function and 65% accurate for predicting its efficacy on depressive symptoms. \n\nThe results of the ReHo analysis revealed that IFG.orb was the main abnormal brain region between the three groups. Neurofibrillary tangle pathology is widespread in the orbital prefrontal cortex of AD patients [ ]. The OFG receives and integrates input from multiple senses, such as vision, taste, and smell [ ]. In particular, olfactory system dysfunction is closely linked to AD [ ,  ]. Sedghizadeh et al. collected olfactory data from AD patients and HCs and used high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimuli to classify AD and HCs with an accuracy of 91.7% [ ]. Mega et al. [ ] divided 30 AD patients into three groups based on behavioral responses to donepezil (responders, non-responders, and no change). Compared with non-responders, responders had more significant de-inhibitory and euphoric sensations as well as significantly lower OFG and dorsolateral frontal perfusion. This suggests that orbitofrontal syndrome predicts behavioral responses to cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in AD patients. \n\nThe OFG is a major part of the limbic system [ ], and a previous study has suggested that the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression may include abnormal activity in limbic system brain regions [ ]. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity between the left anterior cingulate cortex and left OFG was reduced in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder compared with healthy controls [ ]. Matt et al. [ ] used ultrasound brain stimulation as a clinical intervention for AD patients and reported post-intervention improvements in both cognitive function and depressive symptoms. In addition, functional connectivity differences between the salient network and left OFG were reduced compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that the OFG is an important target for intervention in AD patients and is the main imaging marker for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD patients. \n\nSome limitations to our study should be noted. First, although fMRI studies have shown that a sample size of 13 subjects per group ensures 80% statistical power, relatively small sample sizes can affect the robustness of statistical results. Second, different imaging modalities allow changes in brain function to be observed from different perspectives, for example, the changes in white matter [ ]. Thus, the combination of different imaging methods should be used to explore multimodal imaging markers for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD. Third, MRI data were collected after 24\u00a0weeks of donepezil intervention only. Collecting MRI data after 4, 8, and 16\u00a0weeks of intervention may improve our understanding of brain changes with donepezil intervention in patients with AD. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the current study, we compared ReHo among AD patients before and after donepezil intervention and HCs. Abnormal brain regions were located in the OFG. These findings may allow a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of donepezil intervention in AD and the corresponding imaging markers. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11024046,"text_md5":"e6606f0698315b7a2e53a76cfcb10e6e","field_positions":{"authors":[0,127],"journal":[128,146],"publication_year":[148,152],"title":[163,308],"keywords":[322,422],"abstract":[435,2160],"body":[2169,17313]},"batch":2,"pmid":38630202,"doi":"10.1007\/s40520-023-02691-6","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11024046","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11024046"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11024046\">11024046<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11024046  Predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention in Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients using regional homogeneity in the inferior orbitofrontal cortex"}

However, whether holistic reinstatement occurs, and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to drive reinstatement, after a period of consolidation is unclear. Theories of systems consolidation predict either a time-variant or time-invariant role of the hippocampus in the holistic retrieval of episodic events. Here, we assessed whether episodic events continue to be reinstated holistically and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to facilitate holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Female and male human participants learned \u201cevents\u201d that comprised multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person\u2013location, object\u2013location, location\u2013person). Importantly, encoding occurred either immediately before or 24\u2005h before retrieval. Using fMRI during the retrieval of events, we show evidence for holistic reinstatement, as well as a correlation between reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion, regardless of whether retrieval occurred immediately or 24\u2005h after encoding. Thus, hippocampal pattern completion continues to contribute to holistic reinstatement after a delay. However, our results also revealed that some holistic reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion after a delay (but not immediately after encoding). We therefore show that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to a nonhippocampal process, has a role in holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Our results point to a consolidation process where the hippocampus and neocortex may work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Significance Statement \n  \nThe hippocampus plays a critical role in the recollection of episodic events. However, its role in episodic memory retrieval over time is still debated with theories of systems consolidation predicting both time-limited and time-invariant roles. We used fMRI and an experimental assay of holistic episodic memory retrieval to assess hippocampal pattern completion and its relationship to neocortical reinstatement across delay. We provide evidence that hippocampal pattern completion is associated with neocortical reinstatement following delay but that some reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion. Our results suggest that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to an emergent nonhippocampal process, may play an additive role in the recollection of episodic memories following a period of consolidation. \n\n\n## Introduction \n  \nThe recollection of episodic events is holistic in nature ( ;  ), underpinned by a hippocampal pattern completion process ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) that drives the reinstatement of event information in the neocortex ( ;  ;  ). \n\nEvidence for hippocampal pattern completion and holistic neocortical reinstatement has been shown immediately following encoding ( ;  ). However, we do not yet know whether this relationship changes following a delay. This is a critical question as standard theories of consolidation predict a time-limited role for the hippocampus ( ;  ), while others argue that the hippocampus is always required for episodic retrieval ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThere is evidence for decreases in ( ;  ;  ) and sustained ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) hippocampal activity during retrieval following a delay (see also  ). Critically, most previous studies have compared hippocampal activity (or multivariate patterns) at immediate and delayed retrieval and therefore have not directly assessed whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to mediate the reinstatement of episodic events in the neocortex. Importantly, changes in univariate activity over time could be driven by different mechanisms not related to systems consolidation, such as differential rates of forgetting for independent neocortical and hippocampal representations formed at encoding ( ;  ;  ). Thus, by directly assessing the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and neocortical reinstatement across delay, we can more directly assess the mechanistic predictions of systems consolidation theories. \n\nHere, we used an experimental assay of episodic memory ( ;  ) that allowed us to assess the delay-(in)variant role of hippocampal pattern completion in neocortical reinstatement. Across two encoding sessions, separated for \u223c24\u2005h, participants learned three-element events. Events were learned over two or three separate encoding trials, with each trial presenting one of three possible pairs for an event. Events had different associative structures: \u201cclosed-loops\u201d where all three pairs were encoded and \u201copen-loops\u201d where only two of the three pairs were encoded. At retrieval, we tested each of the learned pairs from each event, with half of the events learned \u223c24\u2005h before retrieval and the other half learned immediately before retrieval. \n\nWe identified neocortical regions that showed differences in the BOLD activity between elements that were the cue or target of retrieval and those that were nontargets. Greater activity for closed- versus open-loops in nontarget regions was then used as a marker of holistic neocortical reinstatement ( ). Next, we correlated nontarget neocortical reinstatement with a signature of hippocampal pattern completion (closed- vs open-loop hippocampal activity), for events encoded immediately and \u223c24\u2005h earlier. We used a general linear mixed-effects model to assess both the slope and the intercept of the relationship between the hippocampal contrast and neocortical reinstatement. \n\nA slope greater than zero would indicate a positive correlation, consistent with hippocampal pattern completion contributing to holistic neocortical reinstatement. If the steepness of the slope is consistent across delay, this would indicate a continued role for hippocampal pattern completion, while a shallower (or zero) slope in the delay relative to immediate condition would suggest a time-limited role. Critically, in the presence of a positive slope, a zero intercept would suggest that holistic reinstatement only occurs in the presence of hippocampal pattern completion. An intercept greater than zero would indicate that some holistic reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of pattern completion. This would point to an emergent nonhippocampal contribution that is additive (rather than compensatory) to the role of hippocampal pattern completion in holistic reinstatement. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAn effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.67 for detecting a significant nontarget reinstatement effect was calculated from previous work ( ) with   n  \u2005=\u200526. Cohen\u2019s   d   was calculated from the reported   t  -statistic divided by the square root of the within-subject sample size ( ). As forgetting is expected to occur when retrieval follows a \u223c24\u2005h delay, retrieval accuracy is expected to be lower than the finding reported in  . Pilot data collected with   n  \u2009=\u200912 revealed \u223c14% decrease in retrieval accuracy following a 24\u2005h delay, leading to an adjusted effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.62. Using G*Power ( ) and the adjusted effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.62, we estimated that a sample size of   n  \u2009=\u200930 would be required to detect a significant nontarget reinstatement effect, if one is present, at a power of 0.90 and   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.05. \n\nGiven that previously reported effect sizes are likely to be overestimates of the true effect size, and because we wanted to compare neocortical reinstatement as well as hippocampal\u2013neocortical correlations between two conditions, we aimed to obtain 50 useable datasets (upper limit set by resource constraints). An initial sample of   n  \u2009=\u200930 was collected and analyzed (due to time constraints in relation to submitting a PhD thesis; reported in  ) before the final sample was collected. \n\nFifty-seven right-handed participants were recruited from the University of York student population. All participants gave written informed consent and took part in exchange for course credit or monetary compensation. Participants had either normal or correct-to-normal vision and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. Data from seven participants could not be included in the final sample due to motion-related artifacts in the imaging data (  n  \u2009=\u20091), scanner faults resulting in no acquired imaging data (  n  \u2009=\u20092), or below chance memory performance (accuracy <\u223c16.7%;   n  \u2009=\u20094). Accordingly, the analyses included 50 participants (39 female, 11 male) with a mean age of 21.6\u2005years\u2009\u00b1\u20094.43 SD. The experiment was approved by the York Neuroimaging Centre ethics committee, University of York, United Kingdom. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nThe stimuli consisted of 72 locations (e.g., kitchen), 72 famous people (e.g., Barack Obama), and 72 common objects (e.g., hammer). From these, 72 random location\u2013person\u2013object events were generated for each participant. Note that we used the term \u201cevent\u201d to refer to the three elements (location, person, object) that were assigned to the same associative structure (closed- or open-loop), leaving aside any considerations as to how these relate to real-world events ( ). \n\nEach of the 72 events was assigned to the within-subject conditions of loop (open-loop or closed-loop) and delay (delay or no-delay). Thus, 18 different events were randomly assigned to either (1) open-loop, delay; (2) closed-loop, delay; (3) open-loop, no-delay; or (4) closed-loop, no-delay. For closed-loops, all three possible pairwise associations for each event were encoded, while for open-loops, only two out of the three possible pairwise associations were learnt. Events were never presented together at encoding or retrieval; only specific pairwise associations were encoded and retrieved for each event, depending on whether they were open- or closed-loop. Note that open-loops are equated to closed-loops in the number of elements, but not in the number of pairs. We have previously shown ( ;  ) that dependency is not seen for open-loops when three overlapping pairs are encoded as an associated chain (e.g., kitchen\u2013hammer, kitchen\u2013Barack Obama, Barack Obama\u2013dog), controlling for the number of associations (but not the number of elements). Any differences in retrieval between the two conditions in the current experiment are therefore unlikely to be driven by differences in the number of associations. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe experiment consisted of two encoding sessions and a single retrieval session. Both encoding sessions took place outside the scanner and were separated by \u223c24\u2005h (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD  \u2009  =\u200923\u2005h, 54\u2005min\u2009\u00b1\u2009130\u2005min), including overnight sleep. The retrieval session took place inside the scanner immediately after the second encoding session. \n\n#### Encoding \n  \nDuring encoding, participants were presented with specific pairwise associations from each of the 72 events. Participants learned one pairwise association per encoding trial. All pairwise associations were presented on a computer screen as words, with one item to the left and one item to the right of fixation ( ). The left\/right assignment was randomly chosen on each trial. The words remained on screen for 6\u2005s. Participants were instructed to imagine, as vividly as possible, the elements interacting in a meaningful way for the full 6\u2005s. Each word-pair presentation was preceded by a 500\u2005ms fixation and followed by a 500\u2005ms blank screen. For 36 out of the 72 events, participants encoded all three possible pairwise associations; forming closed-loops ( ). For the remaining 36 triplets, participants encoded two out of the three possible pairwise associations; forming open-loops ( ). Eighteen closed- and 18 open-loops were randomly assigned to each of the encoding sessions, resulting in a total of 90 encoding trials per encoding session (i.e., 54 closed-loop and 36 open-loop trials per session). Participants were not told that any pairwise associations would overlap with each other at encoding nor were they told about the open- and closed-loop structures. \n  \nExperimental design.    A   , Encoding. Participants saw multiple pairwise associations. They imagined each association \u201cinteracting in a meaningful way as vividly as possible\u201d for 6\u2005s. Each association was preceded by a 500\u2005ms fixation and followed by a 500\u2005ms blank screen. Participants encoded open- and closed-loop pairwise associations in an intermixed manner. In the open-loop condition, participants did not encode the third and final association (e.g., wallet\u2013Beckham; see    D   ). Solid and dotted lines were not presented but highlighted closed- (solid lines) and open-loops (dotted lines).    B   , Retrieval. Participants were presented with a single cue and required to retrieve one of the other elements from the same event from among the five foils (elements of the same type from other events) in 6\u2005s. Each cued-recognition trial was preceded by a 1\u2005s fixation and followed by a 1\u2005s blank screen.    C   , The associative structures of closed-loops with example encoding order for three pairwise associations (numbers 1\u20133).    D   , The associative structure of open-loops with example encoding order for the two pairwise associations (numbers 1\u20132). The third and final association (i.e., person\u2013object in this example) was not shown to the participants. \n  \nEach encoding session consisted of three blocks of 18, 36, and 36 trials, respectively, with one pairwise association from each event presented during each block. Each encoding session contained novel events for the open- and closed-loop conditions that were not presented in the other encoding session. During the first encoding block, only pairwise associations for closed-loops were presented. This ensured that the duration between encoding the last pairwise association and retrieval was consistent for closed- and open-loops from each encoding session. In blocks 2 and 3, the open- and closed-loop associations were randomly presented in an intermixed manner. The presentation order was randomized for each block. A break of 10\u2005s followed every 18 encoding trials. \n\nEach open-loop consisted of a common element (e.g., if participants encoded location\u2013person, and location\u2013object pairs, then location would be the common element). For each encoding session, 6 out of the total 18 open-loops were pseudorandomly assigned to one of the three possible common elements (i.e., location, people, or objects). The presentation order for the open-loops across encoding blocks 2 and 3 was (1) person\u2013location, location\u2013object; (2) location\u2013object, object\u2013person; and (3) object\u2013person, person\u2013location. The presentation order for the closed-loops across the three encoding blocks was (1) person\u2013location, location\u2013object, object\u2013person; (2) location\u2013object, object\u2013person, person\u2013location; and (3) object\u2013person, person\u2013location, location\u2013object. These counterbalanced orders ensured that the first two encoding trials for open-loops and closed-loops were identical in structure, such that closed-loops only differed in relation to the presentation of a third encoding trial. \n\n\n#### Retrieval \n  \nDuring retrieval, participants performed a six-alternative forced-choice cued-recognition task. On each trial, a cue and six potential targets were presented simultaneously on the screen. The cue was presented in the middle of the screen with the six possible targets; one target and five foils form the same category (e.g., if the target was hammer, the five foils would be other randomly selected objects from the other events, regardless of closed- vs open-loop or delay vs no-delay status) presented in two rows of three below the cue ( ). Participants had a maximum of 6\u2005s to respond with a button response that corresponded to the target position on the screen and were instructed to be as accurate as possible in the time given. The position of the correct target was randomly selected on each retrieval trial. The cue and six targets were presented until a response was made or when the maximum 6\u2005s limit was reached (M response times  \u2009\u00b1\u2009  SD\u2009=\u20092.86\u2005s\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42\u2005s). Missing responses (i.e., responses that fell outside the 6\u2005s response window) were treated as incorrect trials for both accuracy and dependency (M percentage of missing responses  \u2009\u00b1\u2009  SD\u2009=\u20093.54%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.22%). A 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA, where the dependent variable was the proportion of missing responses, showed no significant effects (  F  s\u2009<\u20090.37). Thus, any differences in dependency across conditions are unlikely to be caused by assuming missing responses would have been incorrect. Note also that due to the six-alternative forced-choice recognition test, the chance of guessing correctly was relatively low (\u223c16.7%). \n\nEach encoded pairwise association (regardless of delay or loop status) was tested in both directions (e.g., cue, location; target, person; cue, person; target, location) across two scanning runs (total retrieval trials, 360; 180 trials per run). For the open-loops, we only tested the pairwise associations that were directly encoded\u2014and not those that could potentially be inferred from overlapping nature of pairwise associations ( ;  )\u2014resulting in four retrieval trials per open-loop compared with six retrieval trials per closed-loop. The presentation order was optimized to measure the univariate BOLD activity in each of the four within-subject experimental conditions (i.e., open-loop, delay; open-loop, no-delay; closed-loop, delay; closed-loop, no-delay; optimization algorithm available at  ). To avoid adaptation effects, cue\u2013target associations from the same closed- or open-loop were never presented on successive trials, and each block contained 18 null trials that each lasted 6\u2005s. In each retrieval block (or scan run), cue\u2013target associations belonging to nine closed- and open-loops encoded during the first encoding session and nine closed- and nine open-loops encoded immediately before retrieval were tested in a random order, making a total of 180 retrieval trials, in addition to the 18 null trials. Each trial was preceded by a 1\u2005s fixation and followed by a 1\u2005s blank screen. \n\n\n\n### Modeling retrieval dependency \n  \nTo model retrieval dependency, we created 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables for the observed data for each participant to assess the proportion of joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval between the retrieval of two elements (e.g., person, object) when cued by a common element (e.g., location; A A ) and between the retrieval of a common element (e.g., location) when cued by the other two elements from the same (e.g., person, object; B C ). For the closed-loops, six contingency tables were constructed (as we test all three pairwise associations in both directions), and for the open-loops, four contingency tables were constructed (as we only tested the two directly encoded pairwise associations in both directions). \n\nWe also constructed contingency tables that estimate the number of trials that would fall into each of the four cells if the retrieval of pairwise associations within an open- or closed-loop was independent. This independent model assumes that pairwise associations from a given event are retrieved independently of one another\u2014that is, if a participant retrieved one pairwise association from an event (un)successfully, this does not predict the participants ability to (un)successfully retrieve another pairwise association from the same event. \n\nThe 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables for the data show the number of events that fall within the four cells (i.e., for the A A  analysis, both A  and A  correct, A  incorrect and A  correct; A  correct and A  incorrect; and both A  and A  incorrect, where A \u2009=\u2009cue with location (A) and retrieve person (B) and similarly for A , where C refers to object). The table for the independent model ( ) shows the predicted number of events that fall in the four cells, given a participant\u2019s overall level of accuracy, when the retrieval of within-event associations is assumed to be independent. \n  \nContingency table for the independent model for correct and incorrect retrieval, over   N   events (  i  \u2009=\u20091 to   N  ), for elements B and C when cued by A \n  \nFor a given participant, the proportion of correct retrievals of, for instance, element B when cued by A is denoted by   (i.e., the mean performance for B when cued by A across all events). For the independent model, when cued by A, the probability of (1) correctly retrieving B and C (across all events) is equal to  ; (2) correctly retrieving B but not C is equal to  ; (3) correctly retrieving C but not B is equal to  ; and (4) incorrectly retrieving both B and C is equal to  . \n\nOnce the contingency tables for the data and the independent model were constructed, the proportion of joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval were calculated for each contingency table separately, by summing the leading diagonal cells and dividing by the total number of events (i.e., the proportion of events where two overlapping pairwise associations within an event are both retrieved either correctly or incorrectly). This measure was then averaged across the six or four contingency tables (dependent on whether the tables related to open- or closed-loops) to provide a single measure of the proportion of joint retrieval and nonretrieval for the data and independent model separately. For brevity, we refer to this measure as the \u201cproportion of joint retrieval,\u201d but note that it includes the proportion of both joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval. \n\nThis proportion of joint retrieval measure scales with accuracy. We therefore compare this measure in the data relative to the independent model. As such, the independent model serves as a lower bound that can be compared with the proportion of joint retrieval in the data. We therefore have a single measure of \u201cretrieval dependency\u201d (i.e., the difference between the proportion of joint retrieval in the data relative to the independent model) for each participant and condition. \n\n\n### Behavioral analyses \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA was used for the behavioral analysis of retrieval accuracy and retrieval dependency, with the within-subject factor loop referring to whether the events formed closed- or open-loops and delay referring to whether closed- or open-loops were encoded immediately (no-delay) or 24\u2005h prior to retrieval (delay). For the analysis of retrieval dependency, we also report one sample   t   tests comparing retrieval dependency in each condition with zero. Retrieval dependency significantly greater than zero provides evidence for the presence of dependency. Alpha was set to 0.05 (two-tailed) for all statistical tests. For each ANOVA, a   effect size is reported, and for   t   tests we report a Cohen\u2019s   d   effect size reflecting the mean difference between conditions divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores. All analyses were conducted using JASP ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition \n  \nAll functional and structural volumes were acquired on a 3\u2005T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma scanner equipped with a 64-channel phase array head coil. T2*-weighted slices were acquired with echo-planar imaging (EPI). Forty-eight axial slices (\u223c0\u00b0 tilt to the AC\u2013PC lines) per volume were acquired in an interleaved order with the following parameters: acquisition matrix, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964; repetition time, 1,200\u2005ms; echo time, 26\u2005ms; flip angle, 75\u00b0; slice thickness, 3\u2005mm; in-plane resolution, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2005mm; and multiband acceleration factor, 2. To allow for T1 equilibrium, we acquired the first three EPI volumes prior to the task and then discarded them. As the retrieval phase varied in length across participants (as each cued-recognition trial was self-paced, up to a maximum of 6\u2005s per trial), the number of acquired volumes differed across participants. Note that the two retrieval blocks corresponded to two separate functional scanning runs. The mean number of volumes acquired during retrieval was 796.80 (range, 621\u2013955) and 774.04 (range, 616\u2013942) for the first and second retrieval blocks, respectively. A field map was acquired to allow for the correction of geometric distortions due to field inhomogeneities. For the purpose of coregistration and image normalization, a whole-brain T1-weighted structural scan was acquired with a 1\u2005mm  resolution using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo pulse sequence. \n\n\n### fMRI analyses \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed in SPM12. EPI images were corrected for field inhomogeneity based on geometric distortions and spatially realigned to the first image of the time series. EPI images were spatially normalized to MNI space with transformation parameters derived from warping each participant\u2019s structural image to a T1-weighted average template image (using the DARTEL toolbox;  ). EPI images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8\u2005mm FWHM Gaussian kernel prior to analysis. \n\n\n#### General analysis \n  \nAt the first level, BOLD activity was modeled by a boxcar function from cue\/target onset to the time a response was made (up to a maximum of 6\u2005s). The predicted BOLD response was then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to produce regressors of interest. In addition to the main regressors of interest, all first-level models included a set of nuisance regressors: six movement parameters, their first-order derivatives, and volume exclusion regressors censoring periods of excessive motion. The volume exclusion regressors were defined as volumes where the movement derivatives exceeded 1.5\u2005mm translation (i.e., 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009slice thickness) or 1\u00b0 rotation (M number of excluded volumes\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u20090.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.60). Parameter estimates for each regressor of interest were included in the second-level analysis to identify consistent effects across participants. Unless otherwise stated, all second-level models explicitly modeled subject effects. All effects reported outside the hippocampus are   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error (FWE) whole-brain corrected (cluster size >30 voxels). We also performed small-volume corrected (SVC) analyses in the hippocampus given the a priori predictions related to this brain region. This mask for SVC was created using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox ( ) with the hippocampus defined from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas ( ). \n\n\n#### Neocortical reinstatement \n  \nThe first-level model included 24 regressors that related to all cue\u2013target pairs (i.e., person\u2013location, person\u2013object, location\u2013person, location\u2013object, object\u2013person, and object\u2013location) for each of the four experimental conditions (open vs closed and delay vs no-delay). At the second level, regions that showed greater BOLD response to cueing and retrieving each element type (i.e., cue\/target), relative to when an element type was not cued or required to be retrieved (i.e., nontarget), collapsed across the four experimental conditions were identified. This revealed three separate regions of interest across the three element types ( ). For each region of interest\u2014defined as a 9-mm-radius sphere centered on the peak coordinate\u2014BOLD responses for each individual across all 24 regressors were extracted. The BOLD response when the element associated with a given region was either the cue, target, or nontarget across the four experimental conditions was then calculated. As such, estimates of the BOLD response across 12 conditions (i.e., cue, target, and nontarget\u2009\u00d7\u2009closed- and open-loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay and no-delay) were obtained for each of the three regions of interest. \n\n\n#### Nontarget reinstatement and correlated activity \n  \nThe first-level model included four regressors corresponding to trials from each of the four experimental conditions (i.e., open-loop, delay; closed-loop, delay; open-loop, no-delay; and closed-loop, no-delay). At the second level, two separate random-effects models were created, one for the delay and one for the no-delay condition. Each model included a single regressor corresponding to the contrast between closed- and open-loops (i.e., open-loop vs closed-loops for the respective delay or no-delay condition). This was calculated by taking the mean difference in BOLD response between the closed- and open-loop conditions for the nontarget element across the three regions of interest. Given the prior hypothesis regarding the hippocampus, statistical effects in the bilateral hippocampus are   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE SVC within a bilateral hippocampal mask. \n\n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nSecond-level data and analyses are available on the Open Science Framework ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \n#### Retrieval accuracy \n  \nMemory performance (proportion correct) across each of the four experimental conditions is presented in  . \n  \nMean proportion correct (and standard deviations) and mean proportion of joint retrieval (and standard deviations) for the data and independent model at no-delay (i.e., encoded immediately prior to retrieval delay) and delay (i.e., encoded 24\u2005h prior to retrieval) for closed- and open-loops \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA revealed a significant effect of loop (  F  \u2009=\u200937.72;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;    =\u20090.44) and delay (  F  \u2009=\u200945.74;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;    =\u20090.48), with greater memory for closed-loops, relative to open-loops, and for pairs retrieved immediately after encoding, compared with those retrieved following a 24\u2005h delay. The ANOVA also revealed a significant interaction between these factors (  F  \u2009=\u200910.78;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002;  \u2009=\u20090.18), with a greater difference in memory between closed- and open-loops at delay relative to no-delay. This is consistent with the finding reported in  . \n\n\n#### Retrieval dependency \n  \nThe mean proportion of joint retrieval in the data and independent model, for closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay, are presented in  .   shows mean retrieval dependency (i.e., data\u2013independent model) for each condition. Evidence for dependency was seen for closed-loops at both delay (  t  \u2009=\u20097.83;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20091.11) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20095.03;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.71). No evidence for dependency was observed for open-loops at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20090.63;   p  \u2009=\u20090.533;   d  \u2009=\u20090.10); however, we did find evidence for dependency for open-loops at no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.19;   p  \u2009=\u20090.033;   d  \u2009=\u20090.31; but this effect did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons; adjusted   \u03b1   for four comparisons\u2009=\u20090.013;  , though we note the smaller effect size estimate (0.31) relative to the two closed-loop conditions (1.11 and 0.71). \n  \nDependency for closed- and open-loops at no-delay (i.e., encoded immediately prior to retrieval) and delay (i.e., encoded 24\u2005h prior to retrieval).

However, this analysis also revealed a significant interaction (  F  \u2009=\u20095.21;   p  \u2009=\u20090.027;  \u2009=\u20090.10), driven by a greater difference between closed- and open-loops at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20095.03;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.71) relative to no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20091.13;   p  \u2009=\u20090.265;   d  \u2009=\u20090.16). Thus, we replicate previous findings showing greater dependency in the closed-loop delay than that in the open-loop delay condition but unexpectedly did not see the same pattern in the no-delay condition. Despite this, a direct comparison between the delay and no-delay open-loop conditions was not significant (  t  \u2009=\u20091.49;   p  \u2009=\u20090.142;   d  \u2009=\u20090.21) or between the delay and no-delay closed-loop condition (  t  \u2009=\u20091.91;   p  \u2009=\u20090.062;   d  \u2009=\u20090.27). There was no main effect of delay in this analysis (  F  \u2009=\u20090.04;   p  \u2009=\u20090.842;  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n\nThe finding of dependency in the open-loop delay condition was unexpected given the previous studies have not found evidence for dependency for open-loops in an immediate test condition ( ;  ;  ). One possibility is that the two encoding sessions in the present study [cf.   who had a single encoding session and two separate retrieval sessions] allowed participants to infer the associative nature of the overlapping pairs in the first encoding session (i.e., delay), leading to increases in dependency for open-loops encoded during the second encoding session (i.e., no-delay). However, it is important to note that dependency is seen for closed-loops at both delay and no-delay (i.e., it is the open-loop, no-delay condition that appears to diverge from previous findings). \n\n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Neocortical reinstatement \n  \nTo look for differences in reinstatement as a function of loop or delay, we first identified regions where BOLD activity differed between the retrieval of different element types (i.e., people, locations, and objects), collapsed across the closed- versus open-loop and delay versus no-delay conditions. For example, to identify regions associated with the retrieval of people, we compared retrieval trials where a person was either a cue or target with trials where a person was neither the cue nor the target (i.e., the nontarget). The largest difference in the BOLD activity for people was seen in the precuneus, for locations in the left parahippocampal gyrus, and for objects in the left middle temporal gyrus ( ,  ). Thus, as in  , people, locations, and objects produced different levels of activation in specific neocortical regions. Unthresholded statistical maps of these effects are available at  . \n  \n  A   , Cortical regions showing activation differences for people, locations, and objects.    B   , Mean difference (collapsed across the precuneus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus) in the BOLD activity for closed- versus open-loops for cue (dark gray), target (light gray), and nontarget (white) trials at no-delay, no delay (when using the open-loop condition at delay as baseline; highlighted with gray, transparent box), and delay. Lines in boxes represent mean difference in each condition. Bottom and top edges of boxes indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Whiskers represent the minimum and maximum data points. ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, corrected for multiple comparisons. \n    \nClusters and peaks showing element-specific whole-brain activity for people, locations, and objects (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster size >30) \n    \nBOLD responses from these regions were then extracted and assessed in terms of how they differed depending on whether the element associated with that region was either a cue, target, or nontarget (e.g., a trial where an object was the cue and a location was the target would be a nontarget trial for people). If closed-loops are reinstated holistically (regardless of delay), the region associated with the nontarget (e.g., the precuneus for people) should show greater activity for closed- relative to open-loops (as nontarget reinstatement is not expected to occur for open-loops). \n\nWe first tested whether we saw a nontarget reinstatement effect, collapsing across the delay and no-delay condition and all three ROIs. This revealed significantly greater BOLD activity for closed- than open-loops in the nontarget region (  t  \u2009=\u20096.02;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.85). We also saw significantly greater BOLD response for closed- than that for open-loops in the cue region (  t  \u2009=\u20092.92;   p  \u2009=\u20090.005;   d  \u2009=\u20090.41) but not the target region (  t  \u2009=\u20090.61;   p  \u2009=\u20090.542;   d  \u2009=\u20090.09; adjusted   \u03b1   for three comparisons\u2009=\u20090.017). We therefore provide evidence for nontarget reinstatement as seen in the previous studies ( ;  ). \n\nWe next tested whether the nontarget reinstatement effect differed between the delay and no-delay conditions ( ). This revealed that the BOLD activity for closed- relative to open-loops in the nontarget region was significantly greater in the delay than that in the no-delay condition (  t  \u2009=\u20094.65;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.66). Interestingly, although we saw significantly greater BOLD activity for closed- than that for open-loops in the nontarget region at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20098.60;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20091.22; adjusted   \u03b1   for two comparisons\u2009=\u20090.025), no difference was seen in the no-delay condition (  t  \u2009=\u20091.89;   p  \u2009=\u20090.064;   d  \u2009=\u20090.27), even though we note that the numerical difference is in the same direction. \n\nFor completeness, we also tested for differences between closed- and open-loops in the cue and target regions in the delay and no-delay conditions. No differences between closed- and open-loops were seen in the cue region, delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.42;   p  \u2009=\u20090.020;   d  \u2009=\u20090.34) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.01;   p  \u2009=\u20090.050;   d  \u2009=\u20090.29), or the target region, delay (  t  \u2009=\u20091.76;   p  \u2009=\u20090.084;   d  \u2009=\u20090.25) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20090.84;   p  \u2009=\u20090.405;   d  \u2009=\u20090.12; adjusted   \u03b1   for four comparisons\u2009=\u20090.013). \n\n Previous studies ( ;  ) have observed a nontarget reinstatement effect for closed-loops retrieved immediately after encoding, and as such the failure to replicate this effect was unexpected. However, the absence of a difference between closed- and open-loops at no-delay is perhaps consistent with the lack of a significant behavioral difference in dependency between closed- and open-loops at no-delay. Given that we observed evidence of dependency for open-loops at no-delay, it is possible that this open-loop condition is obscuring a possible nontarget reinstatement effect in the closed-loop condition. To assess this possibility, we first directly compared the BOLD response in the delay and no-delay conditions for the open-loop and closed-loop conditions separately. This revealed significantly greater BOLD activity in the open-loop, no-delay than that in the delay condition in the nontarget region (  t  \u2009=\u20094.55;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.64; adjusted   \u03b1   for six comparisons\u2009=\u20090.008), consistent with the possibility that participants are reinstating nontarget elements more often in the open-loop, no delay than delay condition. Apart from significantly greater BOLD activity in the closed-loop, no-delay than that in the delay condition in the target region (  t  \u2009=\u20093.24;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002;   d  \u2009=\u20090.46), no further comparisons were significant (  t  s\u2009<\u20091.65;   p  s\u2009>\u20090.0105). \n\nGiven evidence that the BOLD activity in the open-loop, no-delay condition differed from the open-loop, delay condition in the nontarget region, alongside the behavioral evidence for dependency in the open-loop, no-delay condition, it is possible that this condition is not serving as an appropriate baseline for comparison with the closed-loop, no-delay condition. Given the lack of dependency in the open-loop, delay condition, we reasoned this might be a more appropriate baseline for assessing nontarget reinstatement in the no-delay condition. \n\nThe comparisons between the closed-loop, no-delay and open-loop, delay conditions revealed that the BOLD activity was significantly greater for nontarget closed-loops relative to open-loops (  t  \u2009=\u20095.33;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.76; adjusted   \u03b1   for three comparisons\u2009=\u20090.017;  ). There was also a significant difference for cue (  t  \u2009=\u20093.74;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.53), but not target trials when corrected for multiple comparisons (  t  \u2009=\u20092.19;   p  \u2009=\u20090.034;   d  \u2009=\u20090.31). Thus, when we use a baseline in which we did not find evidence of behavioral dependency for open-loops (i.e., the open-loop delay condition), we see evidence for nontarget reinstatement for closed-loops in both the delay and no-delay conditions. \n\nWe therefore provide evidence for nontarget reinstatement in the closed-loop delay and no-delay condition, although the effect at no-delay is only seen in a post hoc analysis using the open-loop delay condition as a baseline measure. Critically, this post hoc analysis does not affect the clear finding of nontarget reinstatement following a 24\u2005h delay (including a night of sleep). \n\n\n#### Nontarget reinstatement and correlated activity \n  \nThe above analyses provided evidence for nontarget neocortical reinstatement in the closed-loop relative to open-loop condition after a 24\u2005h delay. This is consistent with behavioral evidence showing that closed-loops retain their coherence, as measured by retrieval dependency, following a delay ( ). \n\nPrevious work has shown that the strength of nontarget reinstatement correlated with the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast across participants ( ). This is consistent with the proposal that hippocampal pattern completion drives the reinstatement of all associated elements in the neocortex. To assess whether the role of hippocampal pattern completion differs over time, we correlated the nontarget reinstatement effect (closed- vs open-loops) with the difference in the BOLD activity between the closed- and open-loop condition across participants ( ), separately for the no-delay and delay conditions. Note, for this analysis, we used the open-loop, no-delay condition as the baseline measure for the closed-loop, no-delay condition, despite this contrast not providing clear evidence for nontarget reinstatement in the primary analysis. \n\nAt both delay and no-delay, multiple brain regions that have previously been associated with recollection, including the hippocampus (see  ;  ;   for reviews), correlated with the difference in nontarget reinstatement between closed- and open-loops on a whole-brain level ( ). Within the bilateral hippocampal mask (  p   \u2009  <\u20090.05), we observed differences in BOLD activity for nontarget trials that correlated with the closed- versus open-loop contrast at both the delay and no-delay conditions ( ). We therefore provide evidence that nontarget reinstatement correlates with the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast in both the no-delay and delay conditions. Unthresholded statistical maps of these effects are available at  . \n  \nClusters and peaks showing whole-brain regions and clusters within a bilateral hippocampal mask, correlating with differences in the cortical activity for nontarget trials between closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster size >5) \n      \nClusters and peaks showing regions within the bilateral hippocampal mask correlating with differences in the cortical activity for nontarget trials between closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster defining threshold at the whole-brain level   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; cluster extent threshold >5 voxels) \n    \nWe also performed a second analysis to assess the relationship between nontarget reinstatement and the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast. We first identified regions within the hippocampal mask that showed greater BOLD activity for closed- relative to open-loops (collapsed across delay and no-delay and all retrieval trials). This revealed a region in the left hippocampus (peak, \u221221, \u221236, 3) at an uncorrected threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001) (unthresholded statistical map of this effect is available at  ). We then extracted the difference between closed- and open-loops in this functionally defined region for each participant and correlated this difference with the difference in the neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops. Consistent with the whole-brain and SVC analyses reported above, we saw that the activity from the closed- versus open-loop contrast in the hippocampus correlated with participants\u2019 nontarget reinstatement at both no-delay [  r  \u2009=\u20090.68;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; and when using the open-loop delay condition as baseline for the closed-loop condition at no-delay (  r  \u2009=\u20090.66;   p\u2009  <\u20090.001)] and delay (  r  \u2009=\u20090.43;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) conditions. \n\nAs a next step, to assess whether the relationship between the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast and nontarget reinstatement differed at no-delay and delay, we again extracted the difference between closed- and open-loops (collapsed across all retrieval trials) in the functionally defined hippocampal region identified above for each participant, as well as the mean difference in neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops. We then used a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate the strength of neocortical reinstatement (i.e., differences in neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops), incorporating fixed effects of delay (i.e., no-delay vs delay), the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast (i.e., difference in hippocampal activity between closed- and open-loops), and their interaction, along with random effects of participant and delay for each participant. Note that the fixed effects specify predictors of interest, while the random effects account for statistical dependency between within-participant observations. \n\nConsistent with the correlation analyses, the GLMM revealed significant effects of the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast on the strength of nontarget reinstatement in both the no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20096.49;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and delay (  t  \u2009=\u20093.43;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; adjusted   \u03b1   for six comparisons\u2009=\u20090.008) conditions. We also saw that the slope of this effect of the hippocampal contrast on nontarget reinstatement did not differ significantly between delay and no-delay conditions (  t  \u2009=\u20091.62;   p  \u2009=\u20090.11). As such, the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast is predictive of nontarget reinstatement in both the no-delay and delay conditions, and we see no evidence for a difference across delay. \n\nCritically, the GLMM revealed that the intercepts differed significantly across delay (  t  \u2009=\u20094.78;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). While the intercept at no-delay did not differ from zero (  t  \u2009=\u20091.32;   p  \u2009=\u20090.189), the intercept for the delay condition was significantly greater than zero (  t  \u2009=\u20096.82;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;  . This is critical as it demonstrates that, although the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast correlated with nontarget reinstatement at both time points, the reinstatement effect can occur without evidence for a corresponding difference between closed- and open-loops in the hippocampus at delay. Given that this hippocampal contrast is likely a marker of hippocampal pattern completion ( ), this suggests that nontarget reinstatement can be driven, in an additive manner, by both hippocampal pattern completion and a nonhippocampal process following a 24\u2005h delay between encoding and retrieval. \n  \n  A   , Correlation between the difference in the hippocampal activity during the retrieval of closed- versus open-loops (hippocampal ROI defined as a 9-mm-radius sphere centered on the peak coordinate from the closed- vs open-loop contrast peak, \u221221, \u221236, and 3) and the mean difference (collapsed across the precuneus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus for people, locations, and objects, respectively) in the BOLD activity during nontarget retrieval for closed- versus open-loops, separately for events retrieved after no-delay (left) and delay (right).    B   , Mean GLMM estimates (and 95% confidence intervals) for intercept (left) and slope (right) for the no-delay (dark gray) and delay (light gray) conditions. ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001; ns, not significant. \n  \nTo assess the robustness of these effects, we reran the GLMM analysis while removing a randomly selected subset of participants at each analysis point from   n  \u2009=\u20091 to   n  \u2009=\u200920. For each of these analyses, we iteratively repeated the analysis 50 times and removed a randomly selected subset of participants for each iteration. The robustness analysis showed that the significant intercept difference from zero in the delay condition was present in every iteration, as well as the significant difference in the intercept between the no-delay and delay condition being present in every iteration. The nonsignificant differences in the slope between the no-delay and delay conditions were more variable, decreasing below 90% consistency with the main analysis at   n  \u2009=\u20099, with a mean consistency of 83% between   n  \u2009=\u20099 and   n  \u2009=\u200920 and a minimum consistency of 70% at   n  \u2009=\u200920. Thus, the results of our novel GLMM approach to assessing the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and nontarget neocortical reinstatement are robust to the random removal of data points to at least   n  \u2009=\u20099 (i.e., a total   N   of \u223c40). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe show that events, composed of three overlapping pairs (i.e., closed-loops), continue to be reinstated holistically following a 24\u2005h period of forgetting and consolidation. Although memory performance decreased over time (indicating that forgetting had occurred), we continued to observe the BOLD activity related to the reinstatement of elements incidental to retrieval (i.e., nontargets). For example, when participants were cued with a location (e.g., kitchen) and asked to retrieve the overlapping object (e.g., hammer), retrieval also led to the activity in the cortical regions associated with the overlapping person (e.g., Barack Obama), despite no explicit demand to retrieve this element (i.e., the element was neither the cue nor the retrieval target). Importantly, the level of this nontarget reinstatement effect at delay was equivalent to that seen for closed-loops retrieved immediately after encoding (when using the open-loop condition at delay as baseline). This is consistent with behavioral evidence for \u201cholistic forgetting\u201d where events retain their coherence over periods of forgetting ( ). \n\nThe reinstatement of nontarget elements is thought to be a direct consequence of pattern completion in the hippocampus ( ), whereby a partial input can result in the retrieval of the complete memory. We show that the strength of the nontarget reinstatement effect correlates with a signature of hippocampal pattern completion (hippocampal closed- vs open-loop contrast) before and after a 24\u2005h delay. However, although the slope of this relationship did not statistically differ across delay, the intercept significantly increased and was statistically greater than zero at delay. Although this novel analysis and finding appears to be robust to the removal of random participants (at least to   N  \u2009=\u20099 participants), it is nonetheless important that they should be replicated in an independent data set in the future. Our results suggest that hippocampal pattern completion still contributes to the strength of this effect after delay; however, some nontarget reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion following a 24\u2005h delay. This latter finding points to an emergent nonhippocampal contribution to holistic reinstatement. \n\nIt has long been proposed that the role of the hippocampus in long-term memory retrieval changes over time ( ;  ). This proposal is motivated by observations that although patients with hippocampal damage present with amnesia ( ;  ), they often show a temporal gradient to their deficit, with memory for remote events being relatively spared compared with the more recent ones ( ;  ). \n\nStandard theories of consolidation have argued that the sparse activity patterns and high neural density of the hippocampus provide the ideal mechanisms for the initial encoding and retrieval of event-based representations ( ;  ;  ). However, over periods of consolidation, gradual adjustments to cortical connections are thought to allow for the formation of neocortical representations that can be retrieved independent of the hippocampus ( ). Although standard theories of consolidation have noted that this process can be relatively protracted occurring over days, weeks, or months, there is evidence that differences in the hippocampal activity at retrieval already emerge after a 1\u2005d interval ( ,  ). \n\nConsistent with these findings, we found a difference in the intercept between the no-delay and delay conditions when estimating the relationship between neocortical reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion. While the intercept did not differ from zero in the no-delay condition, it was significantly greater than zero in the delay condition (and the intercepts significantly differed between conditions). The nonzero intercept suggests that neocortical reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion following a 24\u2005h period of consolidation. However, our results also show that while the neocortical reinstatement of nontarget elements can be achieved without a corresponding increment in hippocampal pattern completion, the hippocampus still contributes to the strength of this reinstatement effect. As such, while consolidation may allow for the strengthening of related neocortical representations that can be holistically reinstated independently of hippocampal pattern completion\u2014consistent with standard theories of consolidation\u2014pattern completion continues to mediate the strength to which events are holistically reinstated after a 24\u2005h delay. \n\nCritically, these two contributions to holistic neocortical reinstatement appear to be additive in nature; the total amount of reinstatement is the sum of the linear relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and reinstatement and the additional nonhippocampal contribution (at least after 24\u2005h). This suggests that the relationship is not compensatory in nature\u2014it is not the case that as one contribution increases, the other decreases. \n\nOne critical question is whether this pattern is consistent across further delays. It is possible that the hippocampal contribution decreases over longer timescales, which would be reflected in a decrease in the slope of the estimated relationship over time. Such a result would support standard consolidation theories; however, it would point to a more additive relationship during the consolidation process, with hippocampal pattern completion continuing to contribute to the reinstatement of past events even in the presence of a nonhippocampal contribution to retrieval. Indeed, our approach potentially allows for the tracking of independent time courses, where the contribution of hippocampal pattern completion might decrease over time at a different rate relative to the emergence of the nonhippocampal process and that these different time courses might be driven by different mechanisms. For example, the increase in the nonhippocampal process might be driven by active systems consolidation processes during sleep ( ), whereas the decreased contribution of hippocampal pattern completion might be a function of forgetting via decay mechanisms ( ;  ). Tracking the time course of changes to the slope and intercept of the hippocampal pattern completion\u2013neocortical reinstatement relationship over different delays (from one day to several weeks) could assess this possibility. \n\nAlternative accounts of consolidation, such as the multiple trace theory ( ) and trace transformation theory ( ;  ), make a distinction between the maintenance and retrieval of fine-grained, or context-rich, information and more gist-like information surrounding a memory. These distinct representations have been proposed to be represented independently, with the former being more dependent on the hippocampus and the latter on the neocortex. Support for this distinction has come from evidence showing that peripheral details are forgotten more rapidly than gist-like information from an event ( ) and evidence showing that memory for context-rich information of an event (but not gist-like information) tends to be impaired following hippocampal damage ( ). \n\nOur findings may represent an intermediate between standard theories of consolidation and these alternative accounts, where the direct involvement of hippocampal pattern completion in recollection endures, insofar as hippocampal pattern completion still contributes to the strength or precision of reinstatement, despite the emergence of a nonhippocampal contribution to retrieval. Harlow and colleagues ( :  ) have argued that recollection may be characterized by two potentially separable memory components: \u201caccessibility\u201d (i.e., the probability of successful retrieval) and \u201cprecision\u201d (i.e., the precision\/fidelity of the successfully retrieved information). As such, it is possible that the strength (or precision) of reinstatement is reflective of a more continuous retrieval process, such that even in instances where an entire event is successfully reinstated in the neocortex, the fidelity of reinstatement may differ across events, and this may depend on the involvement of the hippocampus ( ;  ;  ). Whereas some initial (less precise) neocortical reinstatement could occur without hippocampal pattern completion following a delay, further (more precise, detailed) reinstatement could still require pattern completion. This would predict that when retrieving context-rich information, the hippocampal\u2013neocortical relationship should be maintained over delay; however, when retrieving more gist-like information, the relationship should decrease over delay. Assessing memory for the perceptual versus semantic features of multiple event elements across delay could address this possibility. \n\nIn sum, we provide evidence for holistic reinstatement following a period of forgetting and consolidation. This is consistent with previous behavioral evidence suggesting that event-based memories undergo a holistic form of forgetting where events that are retained continue to be retrieved in their entirety and events that are forgotten are forgotten in their entirety. Critically, we found evidence that holistic reinstatement in the neocortex is driven by both hippocampal pattern completion and a nonhippocampal process after 24\u2005h. Further, our novel experimental approach allows us to independently assess both hippocampal and nonhippocampal contributions to reinstatement, allowing future research to track the time courses of these potentially independent contributions. Finally, our results show that holistic retrieval is driven by both a nonhippocampal process and hippocampal pattern completion after 24\u2005h, suggesting that the hippocampus and neocortex work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11063816,"text_md5":"808da388467f6145b89d3d49f24b4fb5","field_positions":{"authors":[0,105],"journal":[106,116],"publication_year":[118,122],"title":[133,289],"keywords":[303,358],"abstract":[371,2228],"body":[2237,58964]},"batch":2,"pmid":38527810,"doi":"10.1523\/JNEUROSCI.1740-23.2024","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11063816","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11063816"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11063816\">11063816<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11063816  An Enduring Role for Hippocampal Pattern Completion in Addition to an Emergent Nonhippocampal Contribution to Holistic Episodic Retrieval after a 24\u2005h Delay"}
{"text":"Ikemoto, Satoru and Pana, Raluca and von Ellenrieder, Nicol\u00e1s and Gotman, Jean\nEpilepsia Open, 2023\n\n# Title\n\nElectroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging for clinical evaluation in focal epilepsy\n\n# Keywords\n\nclinical evaluation\ndecision making\nfocal epilepsy\nsimultaneous EEG\u2010fMRI\nsurgical treatment\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Objective \n  \nWe aimed to evaluate the contribution of simultaneous recording of electroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG\u2010fMRI) in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome, localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and decision\u2010making regarding surgical treatment. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a retrospective study to evaluate patients with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG\u2010fMRI. Two evaluators assessed epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy and defined confidence levels. They assessed these clinical characteristics first without EEG\u2010fMRI and then including EEG\u2010fMRI to assess how the results of EEG\u2010fMRI changed the evaluations. We also determined how the clinical evaluation was affected by the concordance level between the blood oxygen level\u2010dependent (BOLD) response and the presumed focus location, and by the confidence level of the BOLD response itself based on the   t  \u2010value of the primary and secondary clusters. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFifty\u2010one scans from 48 patients were included. The BOLD map affected 66.7% of the evaluations by altering evaluation items (epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy) or their confidence levels. EEG\u2010fMRI results increased the confidence levels of epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy in 47.1% of patients but reduced clinical confidence in these features in 11.8%. More specifically, the confidence levels increased for epilepsy syndrome in 28.5%, identification of presumed focus in 33.9%, and determination of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. The BOLD signal confidence level, whether high or low, did not influence these clinical factors. \n\n\n## Significance \n  \nPrevious studies have emphasized the utility of EEG\u2010fMRI for the localization of the epileptogenic zone. This study demonstrated the potential of EEG\u2010fMRI to influence clinical confidence when determining epilepsy syndrome, the presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n   Key points   \n  \nSimultaneous electroencephalography\u2013functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG\u2010fMRI) recording is a noninvasive method to examine patients with epilepsy. \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI can provide additional information for clinical assessment in the evaluation of focal epilepsy. \n  \nClinical evaluation was positively affected by EEG\u2010fMRI in 47.1% of scans. \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. \n  \n \n\n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nPharmacoresistant epilepsy accounts for 30% of epilepsy cases,  and intractable seizures and various comorbidities are a heavy burden to patients.  One treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy is the surgical removal of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). ,   To determine a treatment plan, clinicians investigate and consider many factors including age, clinical history, seizure semiology and frequency, drug responsiveness, cognitive function, electroencephalography (EEG), and the results of various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single\u2010photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, accurate identification and localization of the EZ can be challenging in some patients. For example, scalp EEG lacks spatial resolution and the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) indicate the irritative zone, which does not always reflect the EZ.  IEDs can propagate through the cortex  and may occur contralateral to the epileptic focus. ,   Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is sometimes helpful but invasive and only covers a limited space.  Simultaneous recording of EEG and functional MRI (EEG\u2010fMRI) is a noninvasive method that has the potential to localize the EZ, yet its clinical use remains limited. ,   IED\u2010related EEG\u2010fMRI displays hemodynamic changes in blood oxygen level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signals related to IEDs ,   often in the immediate vicinity of the intracranial EEG focus.  One study reported the accuracy of EEG\u2010fMRI in localizing the seizure\u2010onset zone (SOZ) with stereo\u2010EEG (SEEG) and found that 77% of patients had at least one study with primary EEG\u2010fMRI clusters concordant with an SEEG\u2010defined SOZ.  Another study claimed that the spike\u2010related BOLD response represented intrinsic connectivity networks.  Several studies have proposed routine clinical use of EEG\u2010fMRI in the pre\u2010surgical evaluation of medically refractory epilepsy patients. ,  ,  ,  ,   However, these reports did not assess the added value of EEG\u2010fMRI in a standard clinical evaluation. \n\nTherefore, we aimed to determine how the addition of EEG\u2010fMRI in the pre\u2010surgical evaluation of medically refractory epilepsy patients impacts the diagnosis of the epilepsy syndrome, the localization of the epileptic focus, and the clinician's judgment regarding surgical candidacy of the patient. We retrospectively analyzed the changes that may be realized by adding EEG\u2010fMRI images to the standard evaluation of the epileptic syndrome, the presumed focus, and surgical candidacy. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Study population \n  \nWe identified consecutive patients with focal epilepsy and sufficient clinical information for assessment (i.e., seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, PET, and neuropsychological assessment) from a database of patients who underwent EEG\u2010fMRI from January 2014 to December 2016. At our institute, we generally consider performing EEG\u2010fMRI in cases where the EZ is difficult to identify or ambiguous by standard localization methods. We reviewed the patient's EEG to check if there were frequent IEDs to determine the suitability for EEG\u2010fMRI. Frequent IEDs were defined as more than 5\u201310\/h. Therefore, the cases with an EEG study with few or no IEDs before scanning did not undergo an EEG\u2010fMRI. Each participant provided written informed consent in accordance with the Research Ethics Committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   acquisition \n  \nThe imaging acquisition methods were as described in previous studies. ,  ,  ,   EEG was recorded inside a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI scanner with 25 MR\u2010compatible electrodes placed on the scalp, according to the 10\u201320 (reference FCz) and 10\u201310 (F9, T9, P9, F10, T10, P10) electrode systems, using a Brain Amp system (Brain Products, 5\u2009kHz sampling). fMRI functional images were collected in 6\u2010minute runs for a total scan time of 60\u201390\u2009minutes with the patient at rest, using the following T2*\u2010weighted echo planar imaging sequences: repetition time (TR), 1.9\u2009seconds; echo time (TE), 25\u2009ms; 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix; 33 3.7\u2009mm slices; 3.7\u2009\u00d7\u20093.7\u2009\u00d7\u20093.7\u2009mm  voxel; flip angle 90\u00b0. The IEDs were grouped into types, based on spatial distribution and morphology, and each type constituted a single study. IED types were spike, sharp wave, spike, and wave complex or paroxysmal slow wave, and those IEDs were identified as a burst event when it lasted longer than 1\u2009s; otherwise, it was recognized as a single event. Thus, some patients had more than one study. \n\nfMRI data were analyzed as an event\u2010related design,  each type of IED was built as a regressor, and all regressors were included in the same general linear model and convolved with four hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) peaking at 3, 5, 7, and 9\u2009seconds.  A statistic t\u2010map was created for each regressor using the other regressors as confounders for each event type. A combined t\u2010map was created by taking the highest   t  \u2010value at each voxel from the four t\u2010maps created with the four HRFs (  t  \u2010value\u2009=\u2009contrast value divided by the standard error). A threshold at an uncorrected   t  \u2009>\u20093.1 was applied to the single combined t\u2010map, and the responses with a   t  \u2010value higher than the significance threshold corresponding to a corrected whole\u2010brain topological false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 were identified. \n\n\n### Clinical evaluation protocol \n  \nThe evaluation pipeline is shown in Figure\u00a0 . The assessment consisted of a pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, EEG\u2010fMRI image evaluation, post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, and an assessment of the impact of EEG\u2010fMRI on the clinical evaluation. First, we conducted a pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation according to the clinical history, seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, and PET. Two epilepsy experts independently evaluated the epilepsy syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. SEEGs were included in the evaluation if they were performed within 1\u2009year of the EEG\u2010fMRI scan. Regarding   epilepsy syndromes  , patients were grouped into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), posterior\u2010quadrant epilepsy (PQE), focal epilepsy, multifocal epilepsy, and undetermined. The definition of \u201cfocal epilepsy\u201d was used in cases of suspected focal epilepsy where the region of presumed focus cannot be established, while \u201cundetermined\u201d was used when it cannot be determined whether there is focal or generalized epilepsy. Regarding the   epileptic focus  , the evaluators selected a lobe that seemed most likely to include the presumed focus from clinical information as mentioned above; patients were grouped into right (R), left (L), or bilateral (B), and grouped into frontal lobe, temporal lobe, posterior\u2010quadrant region, multifocal, or undetermined location. Regarding   surgical candidacy  , patients were grouped into \u201cyes\u201d (a surgical candidate) or \u201cno\u201d (not a surgical candidate). For each item (epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy), the confidence level was evaluated at three levels (high, moderate, and low). Definitions of estimated confidence level included:   high  , almost all information (clinical history, all examinations) was concordant with the diagnosis of epileptic syndrome and presumed epileptic focus;   moderate  , general information was concordant, some information was discordant;   low  , some information indicates the diagnosis, and the diagnosis is uncertain but more likely than others. Epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy were \u201cevaluation items\u201d in this study. \n  \nPipeline illustrating the evaluation steps. Pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation: according to clinical history, seizure semiology, EEG, MRI, and PET, epilepsy experts evaluated epileptic syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy. EEG\u2010fMRI image assessment: concordance and confidence levels were assessed. Post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation: a re\u2010assessment was performed with the results of EEG\u2010fMRI. Assessment of the impact of EEG\u2010fMRI on clinical evaluation: quantification of how EEG\u2010fMRI affected the evaluation. \n  \nNot all findings are consistent, and it is often unclear what type of information such as imaging, semiology, EEG, and other findings is most important. The decision on how to weigh the different, possibly contradictory factors reflects clinical judgment and experience. Some clear semiological signs may provide stronger evidence than uncertain imaging results, but the reverse can also occur. The combination of evidence is the essence of the expert's work. \n\nThe BOLD signal of EEG\u2010fMRI was evaluated by the degree of concordance between the BOLD response and presumed epileptic focus of the pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, using the following criteria:   concordant  , presumed focus and highest positive BOLD response in the same lobe;   partially concordant  , any BOLD response, including negative BOLD responses, intersected the presumed focus but the highest response was not in the same lobe as the presumed focus;   discordant  , no BOLD response intersected the presumed focus. \n\nAfter the BOLD maps were visually inspected, a post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was performed, including epilepsy syndrome, presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy, as for the pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. We reported \u201cno effect\u201d when the level of confidence was unchanged between pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluations, and an \u201cincrease\u201d when the BOLD map helped to increase evaluation confidence. \u201cIncrease\u201d included instances when the estimated confidence level changed from low to moderate, low to high, or moderate to high in any evaluation item in epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy. On the other hand, we reported a \u201cdecrease\u201d if the estimated confidence level was changed upon EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation from high to moderate, high to low, or moderate to low. We reported \u201cchanged evaluation only\u201d when the confidence level was unchanged from pre\u2010 to post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, but at least one evaluation item was changed (for instance, focus location changed from temporal to frontal, without a change in confidence level). \n\n\n### Confidence level of   EEG\u2010fMRI   image \n  \nThe confidence level of the BOLD response was assessed as per a previous study in which an association was found between cases with good surgical and EEG\/fMRI studies with a large maximum   t  \u2010value and a clear separation between the maximum   t   and the   t   of the second highest cluster, thus characterizing isolated large responses.  This situation was defined by the following equation: in which   x   is the maximum   t  \u2010value and   y   is the difference between the maximum   t  \u2010value and the peak of the second most significant cluster. If this inequality was satisfied, the image was considered to have   high BOLD signal confidence  . According to our previous report, such a high confidence study had a negative predictive value for the surgical outcome of 100% of cases and a positive predictive value of 44%.  In other words, the t\u2010maps that fulfill the inequality are defined as high confidence cases, and none of these cases resulted in a good outcome if the cluster with the maximum absolute   t  \u2010value was not resected. If the inequality was not satisfied, the BOLD result was considered to have   low BOLD signal confidence  . We assessed if the confidence level of the BOLD image had an influence on the results of the re\u2010evaluation. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nData were analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc.). Continuous variables were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney   U  \u2010test, while categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test. For all analyses,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Clinical profiles \n  \nIn total, 92 consecutive EEG\u2010fMRI studies, performed on 89 patients from January 2014 to December 2016, were included in this study (Figure\u00a0 ). Three patients underwent EEG\u2010fMRI studies twice. Among the 92 studies, the following were excluded: 23 studies due to the absence of IEDs during the scan (25.0%), two due to the presence of severe artifacts, seven due to generalized epilepsy being diagnosed in the pre\u2010evaluation, and two due to missing information. We excluded patients with presumed generalized epilepsy because this study emphasized the localization value of EEG\u2010fMRI. Therefore, 58 studies from 55 patients were included in the EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. BOLD maps revealed that seven studies (12.1%) did not have a BOLD response above threshold. Finally, 51 studies from 48 patients were included in the evaluation (Table\u00a0 ). The mean and standard deviation of the number of analyzed IEDs was 128.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009216.6 (n\u2009=\u200951) in the group with a significant BOLD response, which was significantly higher than in the no significant BOLD response group with 23.7\u2009\u00b1\u200947.2 (n\u2009=\u20097) (  P  \u2009=\u20090.005). \n  \nFlowchart of enrolled patients. \n  \nThe background of the patients was as follows: 15 males, 33 females; median age at the time of scanning, 28\u2009years; median age at onset, 15\u2009years. We performed an EEG and MRI on all patients. Thirteen patients had a pre\u2010existing surgical resection with another intervention under consideration. Regarding the etiology of epilepsy, nine patients suffered from focal cortical dysplasia, five from periventricular nodular heterotopia, four from tumor, one from hippocampal sclerosis and 32 were unknown. SEEG was performed in 13 cases. The high proportion of unknown etiologies reflects that EEG\u2010fMRI studies are most often requested in \u201cdifficult\u201d patients. \n\n\n### Pre\u2010 and   post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI   evaluation \n  \nThe pre\u2010EEG fMRI case evaluation was performed while considering standard elements of a phase 1 pre\u2010surgical evaluation including EEG, PET, semiology, etc. It is noteworthy that some patients had undergone invasive studies and\/or surgery prior to this assessment. The results of pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation are given in Table\u00a0 . The impact of EEG\u2010fMRI results on the clinician's confidence level in identifying the epilepsy syndrome, the epileptic focus, and the patient's surgical candidacy are presented in Table\u00a0 . Three cases are detailed next to demonstrate these findings. \n  \nPre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. \n      \nConfidence level of pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluated by Evaluator A\/B. \n    \nCase 1 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example in which EEG\u2010fMRI increased the confidence level of the evaluators when assessing the various elements of the pre\u2010surgical investigation. The patient was a 24\u2010year\u2010old woman with nocturnal seizures manifesting with hyperventilation and fear. Interictal EEG showed occasional spikes in the right frontal region (F4, Fz). Her MRI was non\u2010lesional and ictal EEG was not recorded. Therefore, the evaluators assumed the presumed focus was right frontal with low\u2010to\u2010moderate confidence because her seizure semiology did not indicate any laterality, and there was little information indicating the localization of the EZ other than the location of IEDs. The BOLD map showed the maximum positive BOLD response in the right frontal region (peak   t  \u2010value, 7.9), which was concordant with the clinical information. In the post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation, both evaluators increased their confidence in the localization of the presumed focus and in surgical candidacy categories. \n  \nRepresentative cases where EEG\u2010fMRI affected evaluation. A, Increased confidence; pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), presumed focus was right frontal (RF) lobe, and a positive BOLD response was concordant. This result increased the confidence of surgical candidacy. B, Decreased confidence; pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was FLE, presumed focus was RF, and a positive BOLD response was located in the right posterior\u2010quadrant (RPQ) area, which was discordant. This result decreased the confidence of surgical candidacy. C, EEG\u2010fMRI changed diagnosis: pre\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation was focal epilepsy, presumed focus was unknown, a negative BOLD response was in the default mode network (DMN), and a positive BOLD response. These findings in the subcortical regions are indicators of generalized epilepsy. This result changed epilepsy syndrome to generalized epilepsy in post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. \n  \nCase 2 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example in which EEG\u2010fMRI decreased the evaluators' confidence. The patient was a 35\u2010year\u2010old man with seizures manifesting with right oculo\u2010cephalic deviation and vocalization. Interictal EEG showed spikes and fast activity mostly in the right frontal regions and rarely right temporal regions independently. His MRI was non\u2010lesional and ictal EEG was not recorded. Therefore, the evaluators considered the presumed focus in the frontal region as the most likely possibility with a low confidence in laterality, but the maximum positive BOLD response was in the right posterior\u2010quadrant and BOLD responses were widely scattered in other regions in the hemisphere. Therefore, the BOLD map raised doubts about the presumed focus and suggested the possibility of an EZ including a wider right hemispheric area, and thus lowered the confidence level of the presumed focus and surgical candidacy. \n\nCase 3 (Figure\u00a0 ) is an example where the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome was changed to generalized epilepsy due to the EEG\u2010fMRI findings. The patient was a 27\u2010year\u2010old woman with seizures manifesting with right oculocephalic deviation as well as elevation and abduction of the right arm, occasionally evolving to focal to bilateral tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Interictal EEG showed diffuse spikes or poly\u2010spike and wave complexes predominantly seen in the bifrontal head regions. Her MRI was non\u2010lesional. Ictal EEG was controversial because the only change prior to the seizure becoming bilateral tonic\u2013clonic was a low\u2010amplitude fast activity over bilateral frontal head regions. Therefore, the evaluators considered that the seizure semiology indicated focal epilepsy, particularly FLE; however, EEG findings indicated bi\u2010hemispheric involvement. The pre\u2010evaluation was focal epilepsy, but the negative BOLD response was in the default mode network (DMN) and the positive BOLD response was in the thalamus bilaterally. There were positive BOLD responses in the right mesial frontal cortex and bilateral dorsolateral frontal activations. Such features of subcortical regions are observed in generalized epilepsy.  Considering the fact that the seizure semiology of generalized epilepsy can show focal manifestations, the BOLD map raised the possibility of changing the diagnosis to generalized epilepsy and decreased the confidence level of surgical candidacy. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on the evaluation \n  \nThe main results are shown in Figure\u00a0 . Of the 51 studies completed, EEG\u2010fMRI results influenced the clinician's confidence level in 66.7% of cases. In 47.1% of studies, the confidence level was increased, and in 11.8% of studies, the confidence level was decreased. There was a change in evaluation items without a change in confidence level in 7.8% of cases. The confidence level was increased with regards to the classification of epilepsy syndrome in 28.5%, identification of presumed focus in 33.9%, and determination of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. (These figures include duplicates, i.e., cases with the increase of confidence level on two or more evaluation items). The results of surgical candidacy in pre\u2010 and post\u2010EEG\u2010fMRI are shown in Table\u00a0 . The BOLD map increased the confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of cases (percentage of increased confidence cases in the \u201cyes\u201d group), and 17.7% were confirmed as poor surgical candidates (percentage of increased confidence cases in the \u201cno\u201d group), due to the uncertain epileptic focus localization or the BOLD map demonstrating the presence of multiple foci. \n  \nResults at each step of the EEG\u2010fMRI evaluation. N\u2009=\u2009Number of cases by Evaluator A | B (percentage of 51 studies that completed evaluations). \n  \n\n###  BOLD   signal concordance \n  \nThe distribution of BOLD signal concordance with the presumed focus was as follows: 27.5% were concordant; 43.2% were partially concordant; 28.5% were discordant. Among the concordant group (concordant and partially concordant), 59.5% showed increasing confidence in any of the evaluation items; among the discordant group, 18.2% showed decreasing confidence. The mean and standard deviation of the number of IEDs in all studies was 128.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009216.6. The mean and standard deviation of the number of IEDs in the concordant group were 126.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009229.5 and 134.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009178.6 in the discordant group. There was no significant group difference in the number of IEDs (  P  \u2009=\u20090.90). \n\n\n### Confidence level of   BOLD   response \n  \nConfidence levels of the BOLD maps were analyzed (reflecting the strength of the BOLD response); 32 BOLD maps had high BOLD signal confidence, and 19 BOLD maps had low signal confidence. Among the 32 maps in the high confidence group, 20 were positive and 12 were negative BOLD response. Among the 19 maps in the low confidence group, 12 were positive and seven were negative. There was no association between these positive and negative BOLD responses and etiology. The increases in the confidence level in the clinical assessment were found in 54.7% of the high BOLD signal confidence group and in 34.2% of the low BOLD signal confidence group. There was no significant difference between these two proportions. We evaluated the relationship of the number of IEDs to the BOLD signal confidence: high confidence group, mean 150.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009268.6; low confidence group; mean 91.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009110.3. There was no significant group difference in the number of IEDs (  P  \u2009=\u20090.28). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this retrospective simulation study, we determined how EEG\u2010fMRI may affect clinical evaluation and decision\u2010making regarding the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome, localization of presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy in focal epilepsy. The results are likely influenced by the perceived clinical value that the evaluators attribute to EEG\u2010fMRI results. A similar situation arises whenever one considers the contribution of a new diagnostic method to standard practice. The gold standard for such an evaluation would be a randomized control trial; however, this is rarely done when introducing new localization methods for epilepsy due to high cost and complexity. The evaluators' confidence in the method was based on the literature on EEG\u2010fMRI, which showed the frequent but far from perfect concordance of BOLD responses with epileptic foci  as well as personal experience in their clinical practice. A similar methodology has been used in evaluating EEG\u2010fMRI for surgery,  the contribution of EEG source analysis, ,  ,   resting\u2010state functional connectivity,  and interictal PET findings. \n\nThe current study demonstrates that EEG\u2010fMRI provides additional value when combined with traditional pre\u2010surgical investigations of medically refractory epilepsy by increasing confidence in the identification of epilepsy syndrome, localization, and surgical candidacy. In the 51 studies where BOLD maps were used for evaluation, clinical confidence was increased in 47.1% of cases, which is significant. The clinical confidence was reduced in a minority of cases (11.8%) (Figure\u00a0 ). A PET study reported comparable results: PET contributed to the presurgical evaluation and decision\u2010making process in 47% of cases with drug\u2010resistant focal epilepsy.  Additionally, the fact that the two evaluators in this study had very similar results reinforces the potential clinical applicability of EEG\u2010fMRI in the context of the evaluation of focal epilepsy and surgical candidacy. \n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on epileptic syndrome and localization \n  \nApproximately 50% of EEG\u2010fMRIs added confidence regarding epileptic syndrome, presumed focus, and\/or surgical candidacy in the present study. A previous report shows that EEG\u2010fMRI contributed to the localization of the epileptic focus in half of the patients in comparison to EEG alone.  Another study reported that EEG\u2010fMRI was concordant with the spike location of 8\/9 patients and it may provide different types of information supporting topography, concordance with PET and SPECT, and structural peculiarities for patients with non\u2010lesional FLE.  We used several modalities in addition to EEG in the pre\u2010evaluation, and we confirmed that EEG\u2010fMRI could add information to a relatively standard clinical evaluation. \n\n\n###  EEG\u2010fMRI   effect on surgical candidacy \n  \nEEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of patients. A study by Kowalczy et al  reported that EEG\u2010fMRI results critically influenced the decision to offer surgery in 17% (10\/59) of the patients in their cohort. This led to resection in one patient and opened new prospects of surgery in three others. Their results align with our study. On the other hand, there is some evidence ,   that EEG\u2010fMRI supports the classification of patients as non\u2010surgical candidates in cases when the BOLD response has multiple activation regions. For example, a case in which EEG\u2010fMRI indicated the possibility of multiple EZs was not considered a surgical candidate and would not be reflected in previous studies of surgical outcome. Our study shows that 17.7% of cases were no longer considered surgical candidates, due to uncertainty of the focus or the presence of multiple foci after this was clarified by EEG\u2010fMRI. Therefore, EEG\u2010fMRI may be useful for the localization of the epileptic focus prior to surgical treatment but also in the generation of supportive information for exclusion of a surgical candidate. \n\n\n### Confidence level of   BOLD   response \n  \nWe assessed the confidence of the BOLD response according to our previous report.  A formula was used to classify the images into high and low BOLD signal confidence. In our previous study, if the region of the peak response of the high confidence level was not resected, no patient had a good outcome. For medium and low confidence levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome, respectively. The authors concluded that the negative predictive value remained high for all confidence levels, and that resection of the primary cluster is necessary but not sufficient to obtain a good outcome because the positive predictive value was low.  In the present study, the concordance and confidence level of the BOLD response did not affect the results. The reason may be that some cases of concordant BOLD responses only confirmed the evaluation but did not change it, whereas some discordant cases were considered to have provided important information resulting in a changed evaluation. This suggests that EEG\u2010fMRI may be useful whether or not the BOLD response is concordant with the presumed focus. Another reason may be the limitation of the evaluation of the level of confidence, which is calculated by the difference of   t  \u2010values between primary and secondary clusters, since even secondary clusters were consistent with EZ in previous reports. ,  \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe key limitation of our study is that it was a retrospective single\u2010center study. A prospective randomized study is desirable, and postoperative outcomes may be a good indicator of whether the EEG\u2010fMRI results lead to better EZ localization and better surgical decisions. A single\u2010center study may contain bias with respect to the patients' background. There may be a selection bias affecting our results since EEG\u2010fMRI is typically requested in complex patients. However, this bias, which exists in all surgical candidacy studies, is seemingly unavoidable. Our successful EEG\u2010fMRI rate (55.4%; 51\/92) was similar to that of another study (50%).  In our investigation, 25% of studies reported inactive IEDs during recording and 7.6% were excluded due to the absence of a significant BOLD cluster. A previous report excluded 46% of scans due to a lack of epileptic activity in the scalp EEG during the recording.  A lower rate of exclusions in our study may be due to patient selection. Performing a scalp EEG is important to determine whether a patient has active or inactive IEDs, and long\u2010term EEG recording assists in this conclusion.  At our institute, inactive IED patients were not EEG\u2010fMRI candidates, and this different selection of patients may have affected our results. Conventional IED\u2010related EEG\u2010fMRI is only analyzed when IEDs are recorded during scanning; thus, one of the limitations of EEG\u2010fMRI is that it is only adapted to patients with active IEDs.  The number of BOLD responses appears to correlate to the number of IEDs analyzed with fewer BOLD responses recorded in patients with few IEDS and vice versa, a phenomenon previously reported in the literature.  Our results were similar, with significantly fewer IEDs in the no BOLD group than in the group with BOLD responses. \n\nAlthough not critical for positive identification of the EZ, a test with high negative predictive value could improve patient selection of surgical candidacy, decreasing cost and exposure to unnecessary risk of surgery by this non\u2010invasive technique. Thus, the strength of this study is that it included cases that were not considered for surgery, and it assessed both the increase and decrease of the confidence level by adding EEG\u2010fMRI to a standard clinical evaluation for focal epilepsy. \n\n\n\n## CLINICAL RELEVANCE\/FUTURE DIRECTIONS \n  \nPrevious studies have advocated for routine clinical use of EEG\u2010fMRI when investigating medically refractory epilepsy, but the impact of this noninvasive modality on clinical decision making had not been previously explored. The current study revealed that EEG\u2010fMRI can increase the confidence level of the identification of the epilepsy syndrome, localization, and\/or influence surgical candidacy in nearly half the cases, whereas it decreases the clinician's confidence in assessing these factors in only 11.8% of cases. Additionally, EEG\u2010fMRI increased the estimated confidence of surgical candidacy in 29.4% of studies while proposing to exclude surgery in 17.7% of cases. This study demonstrated the potential of EEG\u2010fMRI results to influence clinical assessment and surgical candidacy. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, which are nevertheless encouraging. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nNone of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration levels in sensory areas have been shown to correlate with hemodynamic and oscillatory neuronal responses. How these measures relate to one another during working memory, a higher-order cognitive process, is still poorly understood. We address this gap by collecting magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and Flumazenil positron emission tomography data within the same subject cohort using an n-back working-memory paradigm. By probing the relationship between GABA  receptor distribution, neural oscillations, and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) modulations, we found that GABA  receptor density in higher-order cortical areas predicted the reaction times on the working-memory task and correlated positively with the peak frequency of gamma power modulations and negatively with BOLD amplitude. These findings support and extend theories linking gamma oscillations and hemodynamic responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and to the excitation-inhibition balance and cognitive performance in humans. Considering the small sample size of the study, future studies should test whether these findings also hold for other, larger cohorts as well as to examine in detail how the GABAergic system and neural fluctuations jointly support working-memory task performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA finely orchestrated balance between excitation and inhibition is central to healthy brain function. Distinct brain imaging techniques provide complementary insights into brain function by tapping into distinct physiological signatures of brain activity at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Despite important advances, our grasp on the neural bases of cognition remains arguably fragmented because the relationship between the findings obtained across different imaging modalities is not fully elucidated. In particular, how synaptic neurotransmission relates to electrophysiological and to hemodynamic responses is still largely unsettled. A handful of studies have sought to overcome this limitation by combining insights from multiple modalities, including methods that probe hemodynamic and electrophysiological (e.g. oscillatory) brain responses as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration ( ). However, previous work that has jointly probed these measures has focused essentially on primary sensory or motor areas ( ;  ;  ) and it is unclear how these features relate to one another in the case of higher-order cognitive systems, such as working memory (WM). Harnessing such an understanding would be crucial to bridge findings and combine insights from various studies of the neural underpinnings of human cognition. The construction and neural underpinnings of WM have been studied extensively via, e.g. behavioral models ( ;  ), hemodynamic ( ) and electrophysiological neuroimaging ( ;  ;  ), stimulation based approaches ( ) as well as neurotransmitter investigations ( ;  ), also by combining two or more of these alternatives ( ;  ;  ). These studies have revealed distinct executive and storage components within WM as well as highlighted the role of a range of neural processes and cortical structures involved in efficient WM performance. However, because previous work on WM did not simultaneously examine hemodynamics, electrophysiology, and synaptic neurotransmission, the links between the insights afforded by these different signatures of WM have yet to be established. \n\nThe last 15\u00a0years have witnessed a rising interest in determining the links between GABAergic inhibition and both electrophysiological and hemodynamic signaling ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, only a few studies have sought to evaluate the relationship between GABAergic inhibition and other neural signals in higher order cortical regions ( ). Despite the consensus that such multimodal studies are necessary, they are complex, costly and can be methodologically challenging given the diversity of expertise required. Incidentally, the wealth of research conducted on WM would particularly benefit from such systems-level insights in order to bridge observations from different imaging modalities ( ). \n\nInvestigations applying electrophysiological approaches to WM have revealed that it builds on a wide range of oscillatory mechanisms ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) associated with different roles ranging from maintenance to inhibition and to the organization of items ( ), with the interactions between oscillations facilitating the functioning of the WM system as a whole ( ;  ). In particular, electrophysiological studies have shown that oscillatory activity and bursting in the gamma band play a vital role in WM ( ;  ) and that this activity is linked both to the subjects\u2019 memory capacity and to task accuracy ( ;  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, in turn, have revealed intricate patterns of brain areas in these regions supporting encoding, maintenance and retrieval of distinct features, object manipulation and inhibition of distracting stimuli ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Akin to electrophysiological investigations, fMRI-based studies have demonstrated that interactions between various neurocognitive components are central in WM performance, especially in demanding tasks ( ;  ). In recent years, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have also shown that increased GABA levels and GABA-to-glutamate ratios are beneficial to WM capacity and accuracy ( ;  ;  ). These results along with evidence from receptor antagonist studies underline the importance of both glutamate and GABA in neuronal firing during WM tasks ( ;  ). Pharmacological manipulations have also been used to show that GABAergic interneurons play a key role in the generation of both alpha- and gamma-band oscillations which, in turn, link to WM performance ( ). Moreover, MRS-based studies have demonstrated that both the frequency and amplitude of neural oscillations correlate with GABA concentration as well as WM performance ( ). \n\nHowever, because previous studies on WM have not simultaneously probed electrophysiological, hemodynamic, GABAergic and behavioral measures, bridging findings from the different streams of research on WM has remained a challenge, limiting progress toward a holistic understanding of the neural basis of WM. It is possible that the relationships between GABAergic, electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals that have been observed in sensory and motor areas comprise a general principle that holds also in higher-order cortical networks. However, there has been no evidence to date to support this. \n\nHere, we address this gap by combining, for the first time, magnetoencephalography (MEG), fMRI, Flumazenil positron emission tomography (FMZ-PET) data and behavioral measures, recorded in the same subject cohort during a classical WM task. These rare, yet small-scale data with thirteen subjects, allow initial exploration of the joint role of the GABAergic system and neural and hemodynamic fluctuations in WM. More specifically, through this unique combination of modalities, and inspired by previous reports on the roles of gamma activity in both WM and neuronal inhibition, we probe the link between gamma oscillations, Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) and GABA  receptor distribution in WM networks and we examine how these features relate to behavior. We expect that the GABA  receptor density in higher order cortical regions involved in WM would show positive correlations with gamma-band oscillatory frequency and negative correlations with BOLD amplitude. Moreover, we expect that across the neural measures particularly the GABA  receptor density is linked with WM task performance. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects and experimental design \n  \nThirteen healthy, native French-speaking subjects participated in the study. fMRI data were collected successfully from all 13 subjects. For one subject, the MEG recording failed due to technical reasons and one subject did not participate in the PET recording. Moreover, the MEG data of one subject had to be discarded due to excessive blinking. Data of sufficient quality were recorded with all three modalities (PET, MEG, fMRI) from 10 subjects (1 female, 9 males; age 19\u201329\u00a0years, mean 24\u00a0years). All research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, in agreement with the prior approval of the Institutional Review Board and by the National French Science Ethical Committee (CPPRB). All methods were conducted in accordance with the CPPRB guidelines. The fMRI and MEG experiments consisted of a classical WM task of visually presented letters, with 3\u00a0s intervals between consecutive letters. Each letter was shown for 300\u00a0ms. The paradigm comprised three different memory load conditions (1-back, 2-back, and 3-back tasks), and the subjects indicated with a button press, after each letter, whether the letter matched or did not match the appropriate preceding letter. In the fMRI experiment, we also collected resting-state data. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nThe performance of the subjects in the WM tasks was estimated based on the MEG data that also contained the type (match\/non-match) and timing of the subjects\u2019 responses. Here, we computed the number of correct and incorrect responses as well as separate reaction times for them within each individual and WM task. Trials for which the reaction times fell outside 2 standard deviations of the average within the task were excluded from the analyses. Based on the number of true\/false positive\/negative responses, we also derived the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity measures for each subject and task. The behavioral data collected during the MEG recordings were used as the fMRI data were collected immediately after the MEG recordings, leading to potential learning effects influencing the task performance during fMRI data collection. \n\n\n### MEG, fMRI, and PET data collection \n  \nAll data (MEG, PET, and MRI) were collected from the same participants at the CERMEP imaging center (Lyon, France). The MEG data were recorded in a magnetically shielded room using a 275-channel CTF whole-head system. The signals were band-pass filtered at 0.016\u2013150\u00a0Hz and sampled at 600\u00a0Hz. The anatomical and functional magnetic resonance images were collected with a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens Sonata Maestro Class)   .    The T1-weighted anatomical MRIs were obtained with 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u00a0mm  resolution. The functional MRIs were acquired in three runs using a pulse sequence with repetition time\/echo time (TR\/TE) 2500\/60\u00a0msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, field of view (FOV; in-plane)\u2009=\u2009220\u00a0mm, in-plane resolution 3.4\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4 and slice thickness 4\u00a0mm, spacing between slices 4.4\u00a0mm. The PET data were recorded with a Siemens HR+ camera, and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), an agent that binds to benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor, was used. FMZ (RO15-1788) was labeled with 11C, using the methylation process ( ). A dynamic 3D acquisition was applied providing 12 consecutive frames of 63 contiguous 2.42\u00a0mm thick slices, with an isotropic spatial resolution near 5\u00a0mm3 FWHM (full width at half-maximum). A 68Ge transmission scan was used to measure the attenuation correction. A partial saturation protocol consisting of a single intravenous injection of a mixture of 5\u00a0mCi of [11C]FMZ and 0.01\u00a0mg\/kg of unlabeled FMZ was used, followed by acquisition of the emission data for 55\u00a0min. This single injection allowed the calculation of B\u2019max parametric images, i.e. estimates of receptor density, without arterial blood sampling ( ). \n\n\n### MEG data analysis \n  \nNeural activity estimates were obtained from the MEG signals with event-related Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (erDICS), a beamforming technique in the time-frequency domain ( ;  ). In erDICS, the cortical-level beamforming estimates are based on the sensor-level time-dependent cross-spectral density matrix (CSD), computed using Morlet wavelets. Here, wavelets with the width 7\u00a0cycles for every frequency were used to calculate the CSDs between 36 and 104 at 2\u00a0Hz resolution in the range from 500\u00a0ms before stimulus onset to 1500\u00a0ms post stimulus at 17\u00a0ms intervals. The width parameter defines both the spectral bandwidth and duration of the wavelets, with lower frequencies analyzed with longer wavelets that lead to lower temporal resolution, but higher frequency resolution compared with higher frequencies when a constant number of cycles is used across all frequencies ( ). Trials in which the amplitude of either the vertical or the horizontal electro-oculogram exceeded 150\u00a0\u03bcV were rejected. In addition, the MEG data were examined visually and data segments that contained artifacts were excluded from the analysis. The beamforming estimates of cortical oscillatory power levels at different frequencies were computed, using a spherical head model, in a spatially equivalent grid across subjects. The grid, consisting of 3922 points, was constructed by creating a regular grid at 6-mm intervals in an atlas brain and by transforming this grid to the individual brains using Fieldtrip and SPM8 ( ). For the visualization of the data, the volumetric beamforming maps were project to the surface of the brain with Freesurfer ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe fMRIs data analysis was conducted with SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom). The first four volumes were discarded to allow for magnetic saturation effect. The functional images were slice-time corrected, realigned to the first image of the first run and then co-registered with the anatomical MRI. The realigned and co-registered images were then normalized to the standard SPM8 echo-planar image template and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. The data were high-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1\/510\u00a0Hz and serial correlations were compensated for by using a first order autoregressive model. The preprocessed data were included in a general linear model (GLM) that included the three WM condition (1-, 2-, and 3-back) and rest as well as movement parameters as nuisance regressors. The individual-level fMRI data were spatially normalized to the MNI template in SPM8 for group-level estimation of the WM-load dependent modulations. \n\n\n### PET data analysis \n  \nStatic PET images were obtained by summing frames 8\u201312 from the dynamic imaging (corresponding to the acquisition period from 20 to 55\u00a0min post-injection). These static images of the PET volumes were realigned to the anatomical MRIs. Ten-millimeter circular ROIs were placed over the midportion of the pons, a suitable reference region for the calculation of the nonspecific FMZ binding60; the reference encompassed 7\u20139 consecutive MRI slices displaying that structure. These ROIs were then transferred onto the corresponding FMZ-PET slices. An additional circular ROI with 15\u00a0mm diameter was placed over the occipital cortex which commonly displays a high concentration of BZD receptors ( ). A partial-saturation model, based on a Scatchard plot, was then used to obtain the B\u2019max parametric images ( ). In this model, the free ligand concentration is estimated in the pons, whereas the range of the bound ligand concentration is evaluated in the occipital cortex. Using this approach we obtained, for each subject, a set of 63 contiguous 2.42\u00a0mm thick parametric images of BZD receptor B\u2019max. Each individual\u2019s PET data were smoothed using a 15\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u200921\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel; the level of smoothing was chosen to achieve similar resolution to the MEG estimates of neural activity ( ). The PET-data were co-registered with each individual\u2019s anatomical MRI in SPM8. \n\n\n### ROI identification \n  \nROIs were identified separately based on the MEG and fMRI data. For MEG, estimates of oscillatory power were computed in three distinct time windows (0\u2013500, 500\u20131000, and 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms post stimulus) in each of the three WM tasks. These individual-level power maps were normalized by dividing them by the standard deviation of mean baseline activity (\u2212500 to 0\u00a0ms) across the three WM tasks across all grid points. The ROIs within each time window were obtained by contrasting the average oscillatory activity of the 3- and 2-back tasks with the activity of the 1-back task and by identifying clusters that showed significant activity at the group level (Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-size >\u200950,   n  \u2009=\u200910). Here, it would have also been possible to use ROIs known to be involved in WM or to use repeated measures tests to evaluate systematic magnitudes\/rankings across the three WM-conditions. However, as we wanted to identify regions showing WM-related modulations specifically for the present cohort as well as to utilize the same data for the ROI identification and correlations analyses (see section \u201cCorrelation analyses in the ROIs\u201d below), the present bi-variate approach was used. The fMRI ROIs were identified in a similar manner. First the beta-parameters for all WM tasks in each individual were normalized by dividing them with the standard deviation of the beta-parameters during rest in the whole brain. The average of the beta-parameters of 3- and 2-back tasks were then contrasted to the beta-values during the 1-back task and clusters that showed significant activity at the group level were identified (Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-size >\u2009300,   n  \u2009=\u200910). \n\n\n### Correlation analyses in the ROIs \n  \nWithin the identified ROIs, we estimated correlations between both the neural (MEG, fMRI, PET) and behavioral measures. For the MEG data, we determined in each ROI the individual-level peak amplitude and frequency within the range between 40 and 100\u00a0Hz. Here, the data were averaged across all grid points within the ROI. In this analysis, we averaged the data across an 8\u00a0Hz window at each bin to reduce the effects of noise (e.g. estimate of activity of 40\u00a0Hz was calculated based on the average CSD at the interval of 36\u201344\u00a0Hz). The peak frequencies were computed by identifying the frequency for which the ratio of activity between the average of 3- and 2-back tasks and the 1-back task was maximal. The amplitude modulation for each subject was obtained by subtracting the activity during the 1-back task from the average activity during the 3- and 2-back tasks at this frequency. In this analysis, each subject\u2019s data were normalized by the standard deviation in all grid points across all frequency bins in the baseline time-window (\u2212500\u20130\u00a0ms with respect to stimulus presentation across the three n-back tasks). The standard deviation-based normalization was chosen as in n-back tasks the baseline time-window comprises also WM-specific neural activity and by subtracting this activity from the post-stimulus data does not necessarily lead to the accurate quantification of amplitude modulations. The chosen approach, computed across all source locations and frequencies only some of which represent tasks-relevant signals should, in turn, yields a good estimate of random fluctuations within the data whose magnitude depends on the subject-specific overall strength of the MEG recordings. Accordingly, the approach yields normalized estimates that allow comparing the values across subjects ( ). Parametric modeling of the spectra within individual conditions with FOOOF ( ) did not systematically detect gamma-band oscillatory peaks in all subjects in every identified cluster. In the fMRI data, we first averaged the beta-values across the voxels within the ROI. These beta-parameters were normalized by dividing them with the standard deviation of the beta-parameters during rest in the whole brain. The individual-level modulation of BOLD activity within each ROI was then determined by subtracting the activity during the 1-back task from the average activity during the 3- and 2-back tasks. For the PET data, we determined for each MR-voxel within the MEG and fMRI ROIs the closest corresponding PET voxel and defined the unique set of these PET voxels for each ROI. As the measure of GABA  receptor density in each ROI, we used the average of GABA  receptor density in these PET voxels. The correlations between the different neural measures and between neural and behavioral measures were computed using Spearman\u2019s rho (  n  \u2009=\u200910). As with low number of subjects the correlation estimates may be influenced by outliers in the data, we computed the 95% confidence limits for the correlation estimates using bootstrapping for both the correlations across the neural data as well as between neural and MEG-based behavioral data (  n  \u2009=\u200910 in all bootstrapping analyses). In the approach we left out data pairs for 2 random subjects 200 times and computed the correlation values for the re-sampled data. From the obtained distribution of 200 correlation values, we calculated the 95% upper and lower confidence limits. This procedure was applied to all correlation analyses showing significant findings with the full sample of subjects. To evaluate the predictive value of the observed correlation patterns, we also used a leave-two-out-based classification analysis to test whether the linear relationship between data types (e.g. GABA  receptor density and gamma peak frequency) observed within a sub-sample of eight subjects would correctly predict the relationship for the left-out subjects. Here, a polynomial of degree one was used as the linear model. The eight subjects for the training data were randomly drawn 500 times and for each round we labeled for the predicted data type (e.g. predicted gamma frequency based on the subject\u2019s GABA  receptor density) the subject whose true value was closer to the predicted one. This procedure yielded 1000 incorrect\/correct classifications, allowing to determine the overall classification accuracy. The 99% confidence limit for the classification was obtained by randomly conducting the same procedure 200 times with random pairings of the two data types for the eight subjects whose data were used in the training. We also examined using multiple linear stepwise backward regression in SPSS 28.0 (IBM) the possible joint effect of the imaging measures on the behavioral data. The analyses were conducted separately for MEG- and fMRI-specific ROIs, i.e. MEG-measures were examined jointly with GABA  receptor density only in the ROIs identified based on MEG modulations. In the analysis, we applied the default parameters (e.g.   P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.1 removal criterion) within the stepwise backward regression. Unless mentioned otherwise, for all correlations and regression analyses reported here we used uncorrected   P  -values. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo investigate the interplay between high-frequency neural oscillations, hemodynamics and GABAergic inhibition, we measured gamma-band oscillations with MEG, BOLD activity with fMRI, and GABA  receptor density using FMZ-PET all in the same population of healthy individuals. The characteristics of oscillatory neuromagnetic signals and BOLD dynamics in each individual were assessed during the performance of a standard n-back visual WM task. The FMZ-PET data used to determine the GABA  receptor density were collected while the subjects were resting in the scanner. Individual subject WM performance was probed using multiple behavioral metrics (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) based on the subjects\u2019 responses during the MEG experiment. We leveraged this combination of data to probe the relations between behavior and the different neural measures specifically in brain regions showing load-dependent modulation of activity during WM (see  ). \n  \nThe study consisted of the collection of multimodal neuroimaging data during an n-back task and the determination of the relationship between the neuroimaging signals and their link to WM task performance. (A) MEG and fMRI data were collected during the experimental task which consisted of 1-, 2-, and 3-back tasks of visually presented letters, while FMZ-PET data were collected during rest. (B) From the experimental data, we determined (C) the WM task performance measures (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) as well as measures of oscillatory (peak frequency and amplitude) and hemodynamic (BOLD signal amplitude) activity, whereas the FMZ-PET data collected during rest were used to determine GABA -receptor densities across the brain. \n  \n### ROI identification based on the modulation of gamma-band and BOLD activity \n  \nFor both the MEG and fMRI data, the average activity during the high memory-load conditions (3- and 2-back) was contrasted to the activity during the 1-back task (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, see  ), where the MEG investigation was done in three distinct time windows following each stimulus (0\u2013500, 500\u20131000, and 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms). ROIs (2 in MEG, 5 in fMRI; see  ,   and  ) were identified from these voxel-level maps by determining contiguous clusters per modality and time window. The ROI labels in   do not represent any specific parcellation schemes but, instead, give approximate information on the main cortical regions the observed effects extend to. Note also that the extents of the ROIs do not necessarily accurately represent the true extents of the relevant modulations as the observed effects depend on the selected source-modeling approach and the chosen statistical threshold. \n  \nBrain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load for MEG and fMRI (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). Areas showing more neural\/hemodynamic activity during conditions with a higher memory load are shown in red\/yellow and areas showing less activity in blue. For visualization purposes, the volumetric data are projected to the surface of the brain. \n    \nROIs identified based on MEG and fMRI data (MEG1: 500\u20131000\u00a0ms; MEG2: 1000\u20131500\u00a0ms). \n  \n\n### The relationship between GABA  receptor density, gamma-band power, and BOLD activity \n  \nIn the clusters identified based on gamma-band power modulations, peak modulation frequency was identified by comparing the average activity between the 3- and 2-back conditions to the 1-back condition (see   and  ). This approach to identifying peak gamma frequency (and gamma amplitude at this frequency) was used to examine the relationship between individual gamma-band profiles and GABAergic inhibition across participants. This approach is fine-tuned to detecting peaks in gamma oscillations that are specific to WM as they are derived from identifying load-related increases in broad-band high-frequency activity ( ). \n  \nGroup- (first three panels) and individual-level (last two panels) gamma-band spectra in the two MEG clusters of interest for the different WM comparisons. In the group-level spectra, confidence intervals represent the grand average\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM values. The vertical dashed line in the individual-level spectra represents the identified peak modulation frequencies, shown next to the peaks. GABA -receptor densities in the graphs represent the average values within the MEG clusters for each of the example subjects. \n  \nIn both MEG ROIs (Cuneus and Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus), we found a significant positive correlation (Spearman\u2019s rho,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05) between the GABA  receptor density and the peak frequency of the gamma-band activity. The 95% confidence intervals of the rho values were between 0.43 and 0.88 for the two ROIs (Cuneus, CI , 0.46\u20130.88; Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus, CI , 0.43\u20130.83). In both, ROIs, the classification analysis suggested that the relationship determined based on a sub-sample of the subjects was predictive of the relationship in the other subjects (Cuneus: accuracy\u2009=\u200966.4%, CL \u2009=\u200956.95%; Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus: accuracy\u2009=\u200958%, CL \u2009=\u200949.95%). In contrast, the correlation between receptor density and gamma amplitude did not reach significance ( ). As far as the fMRI ROIs are concerned, we found a significant negative correlation between BOLD amplitude and GABA  receptor density in the Precuneus (CI , \u22120.38 to 0.95). The classification analysis showed a significant predictive value for this relationship (accuracy\u2009=\u200963.5%, CL \u2009=\u200955.6%). The correlations in the other four ROIs were not significant ( ). No significant correlations were detected between BOLD amplitude and gamma peak-frequency or amplitude (see  ). \n  \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and gamma-band peak amplitude and frequency in brain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load.

See   for the sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. \n    \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and BOLD amplitude in brain areas showing significant modulation of activity as a function of memory load. The   x  -axis portrays the mean receptor density (A.U.). The correlations were examined in five ROIs (fMRI1: precentral\/middle frontal gyrus; fMRI2: precuneus; fMRI3: inferior parieral lobule; fMRI4: superior frontal gyrus; fMRI5: temporo-parietal junction). See   for the sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. \n  \n\n### Behavioral performance during the WM task \n  \nThe performance of the subjects during the WM task was determined by quantifying the reaction times for each of the tasks (1-, 2-, and 3-back) and the number of incorrect and correct responses, and by deriving the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores based on the number of responses. These measures (see  ) show the expected decrease in performance as a function of memory load and a marked increase in reaction times in the 2- and 3-back conditions compared with the 1-back task (reaction times for correct responses in 3- and 2-back vs. 1-back condition, Wilcoxon signed rank test,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). The other behavioral measures showed similar effects, with significant differences between 3- and 1-back conditions for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (  P  \u2009<\u20090.01) and between 2- and 1-back conditions for sensitivity and accuracy (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05; specificity,   P  \u2009=\u20090.31). \n  \nBehavioral performance in the WM tasks. \n  \n\n### The relationship between GABA  receptor density and WM reaction times \n  \nWhen we computed correlations between the neural measures (gamma-band and BOLD activity, GABA  receptor density) and the different behavioral measures (reaction times, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity), we found significant correlations (Spearman\u2019s rho) only between the GABA  receptor density and reaction times measures (see  ). In the 2 MEG and 5 fMRI ROIs, the GABA  receptor density showed significant negative correlation with reaction times in the 3-back task in the Inferior Parietal Lobule (CI , \u22120.60 to \u22120.88) and Temporo-Parietal Junction (CI , \u22120.62 to \u22120.93; see  ). In both regions, the classification analysis suggested that the relationship determined in a set of subjects would correctly predict the relationship between GABA  receptor density and reaction times in other subjects (Inferior Parietal Lobule: accuracy\u2009=\u200965.7%, CL \u2009=\u200950.45%; Temporo-Parietal Junction: accuracy\u2009=\u200965.5%, CL \u2009=\u200951.7%). Across the ROIs, the GABA  receptor density showed significant negative correlation with the reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks in the Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus (CI , \u22120.50 to \u22120.79), Inferior Parietal Lobule (CI , \u22120.60 to \u22120.79) and Temporo-Parietal Junction (CI , \u22120.50 to \u22120.81). In all these regions, the classification analysis yielded significant results in predicting the reaction times difference from the GABA  receptor density (Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus: accuracy\u2009=\u200967.6%, CL \u2009=\u200953.8%; Inferior Parietal Lobule: accuracy\u2009=\u200969.8%, CL \u2009=\u200954.55%; Temporo-Parietal Junction\u2009=\u200968.3%, CL \u2009=\u200954.05%). We also tested whether the reaction times were associated with the GABA  receptor density in cortical motor regions. The correlation between the reaction times measures and GABA  receptor density in the anatomically defined Precentral Gyrus ( ) were not significant neither in the left (GABA  vs. reaction times in the 3-back task: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   P  \u2009=\u20090.25; GABA  vs. reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.44,   P  \u2009=\u20090.20) nor the right hemisphere (GABA  vs. reaction times in the 3-back task: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.58,   P  \u2009=\u20090.088; GABA  vs. reaction times difference between the 3- and 1-back tasks: rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.55,   P  \u2009=\u20090.10). The whole brain analysis of the relationship between reaction times and GABA -receptor density did reveal smaller significant clusters within the precentral gyrus, but these did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (see  ). \n  \nCorrelation (Spearman\u2019s rho) between GABA -receptor density and reaction times during the WM tasks in the ROIs identified based modulation of activity as a function of memory load. The tested reaction-time measures represent the correct responses in the 3-back task (RT) and the difference between the correct responses in 3- and 1-back tasks (RT difference). See   for the anatomical descriptions, sizes, Brodmann areas, and Talairach coordinates of the ROIs. For visualization purposes, the volumetric data are projected to the surface of the brain. \n  \n\n\n## Results in other frequency bands \n  \nWe also tested whether the amplitude or frequency properties of oscillations in other bands (theta, alpha, beta) would show any correlations with the receptor density in regions that exhibit memory load-dependent activity within these frequency bands (see   and  ). Across the ROIs identified in the theta, alpha, and beta bands, no significant correlations were detected between neural activity and GABA  receptor density (see  ). \n\n### Extension to more general task-based modulations (WM TASK vs. REST) \n  \nThe primary focus in this study has been on brain regions that exhibit memory load-dependent brain activity modulations, i.e. areas identified by comparing the activity between the 3- and 2-back conditions to the 1-back condition. However, for completeness, we also contrasted the WM task condition to resting data in order to identify regions more generally involved in the WM task (see   and  ). These TASK vs. REST analyses revealed that in the Middle Occipital Gyrus, GABA -receptor density correlated positively with the gamma-band peak frequency and negatively with the BOLD amplitude (see  ), which is in line with and confirms observations reported in previous studies ( ;  ). This analysis also revealed a positive correlation between the BOLD amplitude and GABA -receptor density in the left Inferior Parietal Lobule. In several of the ROIs identified based on the modulation of gamma-band or BOLD activity (Postcentral Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, Middle Occipital Gyrus), significant correlations (see   and  ) were detected between the GABA -receptor density and reaction times as well as between the BOLD amplitude and reaction times in one ROI (Middle Occipital Gyrus). \n\n\n### Joint influence of imaging measures on behavior \n  \nWe also examined using multiple linear stepwise backward regression whether the different imaging measures would jointly explain the variability in the behavioral measures across the ROIs identified based on the WM-load dependent as well as TASK vs. REST modulations. The analysis revealed that for isolated ROI and behavioral measure combinations the behavioral variability could be better explained by two vs. one imaging measure (see   for full list of significant\/marginally significant findings). Such findings were made for the combination of GABA  receptor density estimates with both MEG and fMRI amplitude, and for several behavioral measures (reaction times difference, accuracy, sensitivity). This was particularly the case for cluster in the Postcentral gyrus (identified in MEG TASK vs. REST contrast), in which the best linear model for explaining both accuracy and sensitivity consisted of the GABA  receptor density and MEG amplitude modulation. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe combined fMRI, MEG, and FMZ-PET-based estimates of GABA  receptor density within the same subject cohort to probe the relationships between GABAergic inhibition, hemodynamic modulations and oscillatory activity, in an attempt to achieve a more holistic view of the neural mechanisms underlying WM. Our primary goal was to elucidate the relationship between the neural activity, hemodynamics and neurotransmitter measures in higher-order regions, a question that has previously been addressed in humans primarily only in sensory and motor regions. In contrast to previous work, we focused specifically on regions showing modulation of activity as a function of WM load and found that GABA -receptor density correlated positively with the peak frequency of gamma-band power modulations and negatively with BOLD amplitude in such areas. Interestingly, when we compared the different neural measures to behavioral parameters, we found significant correlations exclusively between the GABA  receptor density and WM reaction times in the Inferior Parietal Lobule, Temporo-Parietal Junction and Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus. These observations align well with our hypotheses building on previous studies examining the relationship between gamma-band activity and GABA in primary sensory cortices ( ;  ), GABA and BOLD dynamics ( ), and the importance of the GABAergic system of explaining the individual task-performance ( ). Our findings demonstrate that GABAergic inhibition is central in shaping gamma oscillations and hemodynamic activity in higher-order regions and in explaining the between-subject performance variability on the WM task. \n\nContrasting high vs. low memory load conditions revealed modulation of gamma-band activity in the bilateral Cuneus and Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus. In both regions, the gamma peak modulation frequency (but not amplitude) correlated with the GABA  receptor density measured in the same areas at rest. Significant correlation between the GABA  receptor density and gamma peak frequency was detected also in the Poscentral Gyrus, which showed modulation of activity in TASK vs. REST. These findings extend previous neuroimaging results in the primary visual cortex ( ;  ) as well as from animal and modeling studies supporting the role GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the generation and shaping of gamma-band oscillations ( ;  ;  ). Importantly, our findings indicate that the mechanisms of gamma-band oscillations follow the same principles in higher-order human cortical regions as seen in the primary sensory regions as well in animal models. Notably, for the present data, the gamma-band peak frequency was best identified via the ratio of neural activity between high and low WM load conditions (see   and  ). These spectra revealed also potentially interesting differences across subjects, with single and multiple peaks within the gamma bands as well as differences in the presence of sustained high-frequency (>100\u00a0Hz) activity. Accordingly, the gamma-band modulation spectra show effects other than the main peak frequency whose relationship with the GABAergic system was not explored within the present study. Interestingly, the original findings demonstrating link between the GABAergic system and gamma oscillations in humans using MRS-based estimates of GABA concentration ( ) were not replicated when the same phenomena were studied in a larger cohort ( ). Here, as in our previous study ( ), we used PET-FMZ based estimates of GABA  receptor density and detected correlations between the gamma-band peak modulation frequency and receptor density in both higher- and lower-order brain regions. This suggests that the PET-FMZ based estimation of GABAergic system may provide a better proxy than the MRS based estimates which do not dissociate the contributions of the neurotransmitter metabolic pool from the synaptic pool ( ). This notion aligns with the high test\u2013retest reliability of PET-FMZ based measurements ( ). The present finding should, however, be replicated in a larger cohort to corroborate the value of PET-FMZ based quantification of the GABAergic system for evaluating the generation of gamma-band oscillations. It should also be noted that the synaptic specificity of FMZ is limited as it binds also to extrasynaptic subunits of GABA-BZD receptors. Specific synaptic properties could potentially be better captured by using the inverse agonist GABA-BZD receptor PET tracer [11C]Ro15-4513 ( ). Here, we interpreted according to the common view that the PET-based estimates that depend on the binding of FMZ to the \u03b1-subtype of GABA  receptors to represent GABA  receptor density. While these estimates can be influenced by, e.g. extrasynaptic binding, animal studies suggest that the FMZ-based estimates measure accurately the occupancy of the \u03b1-subtype of GABA  receptors ( ). Moreover, within the present cohort of healthy subjects there should not be subject-specific losses of pyramidal neurons that may also underlie differences in GABA  receptor density estimates across subject populations ( ). Thus, while the receptor density estimates could be improved by using, e.g. [11C]Ro15-4513, the PET-FMZ based measure used in the present study should represent specifically GABA  receptor density as opposed to other neuronal properties. However, the present data do not allow us to identify possible reasons for the observed variability in the receptor density across subjects. It should also be noted that in the present study the focus was on examining the relationships between different neural measures in ROIs that average the GABA  receptor density estimates across extended sets of voxels. Accordingly, the analyses are insensitive to local variations in different neural properties such as synaptic and extrasynaptic binding. For spatially more detailed examinations the specificity of the PET binding agent might play a larger role. Moreover, in such investigations, it could be beneficial to maximize the resolutions of the MEG and fMRI estimates by, e.g. using realistic conductor models in MEG and higher field strengths in fMRI. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that BOLD amplitude correlates negatively with GABA concentration in several cortical regions ( ;  ;  ). Here, we detected the same phenomenon in the higher-order regions showing modulation of BOLD activity as a function of memory load (left Parietal Cortex and bilateral Precuneus) as well in the Middle Occipital Gyrus that showed modulation of activity in TASK vs. REST. This demonstrates that the PET-FMZ-based measure of GABA  receptor density facilitates the study of the relationship between the GABAergic system and hemodynamics, allowing such investigations to be conducted with improved spatial resolution compared with MRS-based studies. However, the observed relationship between BOLD and GABA  receptor density was not as robust as for the MEG ROIs, as significant correlations were detected in three of the four MEG ROIs but only in three of the eleven fMRI ROIs. This suggests either that PET-FMZ-based estimates do not sufficiently capture the GABAergic underpinnings of BOLD dynamics, or that due to the specific properties and complexity of the BOLD response ( ;  ), the relationship between GABA  receptor density and BOLD response is not as straightforward as between gamma-band oscillations and receptor density. Furthermore, it is possible that the use of 1.5\u00a0T scanner compared with scanners with higher field strengths may have reduced the sensitivity of the fMRI analyses, leading to underrepresentation of the link between BOLD dynamics and the GABAergic system in the present study. \n\nIn neuroimaging studies, the GABAergic system has been linked previously to various behavioral measures such as orientation discrimination, perceptual acuity and dynamics, time perception and subconscious motor processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Notably, it has been shown that in visual competition, the concentration of GABA in the frontal eye field correlated negatively with the subject\u2019s motor decision speed ( ). This observation aligns with our findings that GABA  receptor density in several higher-order regions (Inferior Parietal Lobule, Temporo-Parietal Junction and Medial\/Middle Frontal Gyrus) correlated negatively with reaction times in the WM task. However, in contrast to the study by Sumner et\u00a0al. ( ), the speed of WM task performance in our study correlated with properties of the GABAergic system in higher-order regions that do not directly control muscle movements. This finding suggests that GABAergic properties of regions responsible for the storage and manipulation of items in WM also affects the speed of processing in n-back tasks, likely via facilitation of the related decision making. This notion is further supported by our observation of a negative correlation between GABA  receptor density and reaction times in regions showing modulation of activity for TASK vs. REST. Here, significant correlations were detected in the Postcentral Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus and Inferior Parietal Lobule\u2014regions that do not directly control the motor output either. In our study, we did not observe significant correlation between GABA  receptor density in the precentral gyrus and reaction-time measures, indicating that performance in the WM task (as measured by the reaction times) is more driven by properties of higher-order brain areas supporting WM than by regions directly controlling the motor output. Nor did we detect any significant correlations between GABA  receptor density and other behavioral measures (accuracy, specificity, sensitivity). One possible explanation for this is that the other behavioral scores show markedly less variability across subjects than reaction time measures, and that to capture these effects, a larger cohort of subjects would have been required. Along the same lines, no significant correlations were detected between the other behavioral measures and modulations of gamma-band and BOLD activity in higher-order cortical regions. However, while we did not detect significant correlations between MEG and behavioral measures, in two of the four MEG ROIs (Cuneus, Postcentral Gyrus), the correlations between gamma-band amplitude and accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores were predominantly negative, aligning with previous findings ( ). We also applied multiple stepwise backward linear regression to test whether the imaging measures would jointly explain the behavioral variability in task performance. Such effects were detected particularly for the MEG ROIs identified via the TASK vs. REST contrast, for which the reaction times difference was best explained by the joint information in gamma-amplitude and GABA  receptor density in both the Middle Occipital Gyrus and right Parietal lobule and where the task accuracy was best explained by the joint information in gamma-amplitude and GABA  receptor density in the right Parietal Lobule. These finding pose the interesting notion that the static properties of the GABAergic system (here GABA  receptor density) and task-specific neural modulations would jointly predict how well an individual performs in WM tasks. However, considering the small number of these findings across the conducted tests, their moderate statistical significance and the small sample size of the study, this interpretation should be taken with caution. \n\nThe different neural signaling measures (oscillations, hemodynamics, GABA) we examined have all been studied extensively within the field of WM and memory function. For these measures, we detected significant correlations with behavior almost exclusively for GABA  receptor density, demonstrating the importance of the GABAergic system in WM and memory function. Work on freely moving and behaving mice and rats has demonstrated that cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic neurons and GABA  signaling in astrocytes influence memory behaviors including WM ( ;  ). In human studies, GABA concentration in the occipital cortex, perigenual anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to correlate with changes in WM task accuracy between low and high memory load conditions ( ;  ). In the present study, we found that GABA  receptor density correlated both with reactions times in the highest load condition as well as with reaction-time differences between high and low load conditions (3- vs. 1-back). These effects were detected in the parietal and prefrontal cortices as well as in the temporo-parietal junction, highlighting that the effect of the GABAergic system on WM performance spans wide cortical networks. Moreover, they demonstrate that properties of the GABAergic system influence multiple aspects of WM task performance. Notably, previous studies have shown that in addition to GABA signaling, the amplitude of oscillatory activity\u2014especially in the beta- and gamma-band\u2014correlates with WM task accuracy ( ;  ). While we did not replicate these findings, we saw tendencies of this phenomenon in the gamma band for the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures. This suggests the possibility that high-frequency oscillations critically support WM task performance beyond direct inhibitory mechanisms but that the detection of these effects requires a larger cohort of subjects than for the link between WM performance and PET-FMZ-based estimates of GABA  receptor density. It should also be noted that studies in schizophrenia patients have shown that WM can be influenced in more elaborate manners than just via GABA concentration ( ) and that the neuronal architecture of GABAergic inhibitory regulation can vary across cortical regions ( ). Thus, to capture the intricacies of the role of GABAergic signaling in WM, GABA  receptor density measurements should be complemented by other measures that highlight more specific aspects of the GABAergic system. \n\nAlthough the sample size in this study is an obvious limitation, the data provide a very rare opportunity to examine within the same individuals, data collected using MEG, fMRI, and Flu-PET. Because these unique data sets were collected from healthy controls as part of a restricted clinical study on schizophrenia, we were not able to get data from more individuals. We acknowledge that our observations will benefit from replication in the future. Nevertheless, we believe that the statistically significant results reported here provide novel findings that can be useful for current discussions within the cognitive and systems neuroscience communities. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe simultaneously explored GABA  receptor distributions, electrophysiological and hemodynamic modulations, and task performance in order to advance our understanding of the links between GABAergic inhibition, hemodynamics and oscillatory modulations in higher-order cortical regions, in an attempt to achieve a more holistic view of the neural basis of WM. Our results show that GABA  receptor density correlated both with high-frequency neural oscillations as well as with modulation of hemodynamic activity in several higher-order regions\u2014demonstrating that the generation and shaping of gamma-band oscillations in higher-order brain regions supporting WM follow inhibitory interneuron-dependent principles similar to those that have been observed in primary sensory regions. We also observed that among the different neural signals, estimates of GABAergic neurotransmission\u2014as proxied by GABA  receptor density\u2014were the most predictive measure of behavioral variability in WM across subjects. Taken together, our findings provide key systems neuroscience insights into the role of GABAergic inhibition in shaping neural dynamics in higher-order cortical regions and WM performance. This work paves the way for future studies with larger cohorts that could further delineate on a larger scale the links between synaptic neurotransmission, neuronal oscillations, and hemodynamic brain activity in healthy cognition as well as in neurological and psychiatric conditions. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10839845,"text_md5":"b8095a470833e6ffc62b4e55b45fa41c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,171],"journal":[172,184],"publication_year":[186,190],"title":[201,288],"keywords":[302,417],"abstract":[430,1909],"body":[1918,52853]},"batch":2,"pmid":38186005,"doi":"10.1093\/cercor\/bhad522","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10839845","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10839845"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10839845\">10839845<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10839845  GABAergic inhibition shapes behavior and neural dynamics in human visual working memory"}

Yet how the rate of drug-induced dopamine increases impacts brain network communication remains unresolved. We manipulated route of MP administration to generate fast versus slow dopamine increases. We hypothesized that fast versus slow dopamine increases would result in a differential pattern of global brain connectivity (GBC) in association with regional levels of dopamine D1 receptors, which are critical for drug reward. Twenty healthy adults received MP intravenously (0.5\u2009mg\/kg; fast dopamine increases) and orally (60\u2009mg; slow dopamine increases) during simultaneous [ C]raclopride PET-fMRI scans (double-blind, placebo-controlled). We tested how GBC was temporally associated with slow and fast dopamine increases on a minute-to-minute basis. Connectivity patterns were strikingly different for slow versus fast dopamine increases, and whole-brain spatial patterns were negatively correlated with one another (rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.54,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). GBC showed \u201cfast>slow\u201d associations in dorsal prefrontal cortex, insula, posterior thalamus and brainstem, caudate and precuneus; and \u201cslow>fast\u201d associations in ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and frontopolar cortex (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \u201cFast>slow\u201d GBC patterns showed significant spatial correspondence with D1 receptor availability (estimated via normative maps of [ C]SCH23390 binding; rho\u2009=\u20090.22,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Further, hippocampal GBC to fast dopamine increases was significantly negatively correlated with self-reported \u2018high\u2019 ratings to intravenous MP across individuals (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.68,   p  \u2009=\u20090.015). Different routes of MP administration produce divergent patterns of brain connectivity. Fast dopamine increases are uniquely associated with connectivity patterns that have relevance for the subjective experience of drug reward. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe faster a drug enters the brain, the more rewarding it is. For instance, when stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MP) are delivered via routes that result in fast brain delivery (e.g., intravenous injection), they produce a greater \u2018high\u2019 (i.e., euphoria) than when delivered via routes that result in slower brain delivery (e.g., orally) [ ]. These effects are in large part due to the speed at which these routes of administration increase striatal dopamine [ ]. In rats, speedier delivery of cocaine produces a faster rise in dopamine and, accordingly, greater cocaine self-administration [ \u2013 ]. Likewise, in humans, intravenous compared to oral drug administration produces faster increases in striatal dopamine [ ], and chronic drug misuse via faster routes of administration are associated with faster transition to substance use disorder (SUD) and more severe symptomatology [ ,  ]. These studies support the theory that fast dopamine increases elicit neuroplastic changes in large-scale brain circuits underlying reward, promoting further drug-seeking behavior [ ]. Therefore, finding circuits sensitive to rate of dopamine increases is a key step in understanding the pathophysiology of SUD. \n\nEarly human studies using positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed that faster routes of MP administration produced a greater and more consistent \u2018high\u2019 than routes of administration that resulted in slower delivery [ \u2013 ]. However, these studies could not identify the downstream circuit effects of fast dopamine increases, and how these contributed to the experience of drug reward. In a recent study we utilized simultaneous PET-fMRI [ ] while healthy adults were administered MP orally (triggering slow dopamine increases) and intravenously (triggering fast dopamine increases) to begin exploring this phenomenon [ ]. We found that both slow and fast dopamine increases decreased fMRI activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. However, only fast dopamine increases activated the \u2018salience network\u2019, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula. \n\nThis finding was an important first step, yet regional fMRI activation patterns only describe part of the complex network response to MP. Further, it remains unclear how network connectivity changes may predict individual differences in the subjective experience of drug reward, a measure with predictive value for future substance misuse [ ]. Global brain connectivity (GBC; also known as \u2018weighted degree\u2019 [ ,  ]) is a marker of whole-brain network communication with strong test-rest reliability [ ] that is well-suited to address these issues: GBC exhibits (a) neurobiological relevance, showing strong association with target receptor stimulation in response to drugs and (b) behavioral relevance, showing strong association with individual differences in the subjective experience to drugs [ ,  ]. There are also methodological advantages to GBC because it requires no a priori seed region selection, and it can be examined at voxel level or parcellated into large-scale networks that support healthy brain function. A recent large-scale study showed that GBC changes in response to 10 different psychoactive drugs depended on the spatial distribution of each drug\u2019s target receptor and\/or transporter density [ ]. Thus, GBC is an excellent candidate to further explore more complex patterns of network communication in response to fast and slow dopamine increases. \n\nHere, we re-analyzed data from our prior PET-fMRI study and tested how the rate of dopamine increases impacts GBC. We hypothesized that slow and fast dopamine increases would elicit different patterns of GBC because they would stimulate different dopamine receptor subtypes that have unique spatial distributions. Specifically, whereas slow dopamine would primarily stimulate high-affinity D  receptors, fast dopamine should additionally stimulate the lower-affinity D  receptors [ \u2013 ]. In line with this, we hypothesized that GBC patterns associated with fast compared to slow dopamine increases would show spatial correspondence with normative maps of D  receptors. Finally, in exploratory analysis, we tested how GBC patterns in functional brain networks correlated with individual differences in self-reports of \u2018high\u2019 to MP. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \nSome of the PET data and the behavioral data (\u2018high\u2019 ratings) were previously reported in a recent publication [ ]. Here, we investigated the relationship between dynamic dopamine changes and brain functional connectivity assessed with fMRI. All of the primary fMRI results in this manuscript are novel and have not been published. \n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy individuals (36.1\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 years old; 9 females) participated in the study (see Supplementary Table\u00a0  for participant characteristics). Participants were recruited through referrals from the NIH Volunteer Office, the Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison (PRPL) Office, ResearchMatch.org, by word of mouth, and through Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved advertisements. All individuals provided informed consent to participate in this double-blind placebo-controlled study, which was approved by the IRB at the National Institutes of Health (Combined Neurosciences White Panel; Protocol 17-AA-0178). This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (trial   on October 31, 2017). All participants self-reported no history of nicotine\/tobacco use. All participants were compensated for study participation. \n\n\n### Exclusion criteria \n  \nParticipants were screened to exclude major medical and neuropsychiatric disorders that can impact brain function (seizures, tics, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks, mood disorders, glaucoma, neurodegenerative disorders), past or present history of substance use disorders (lack of drug use was confirmed with a urine drug screen for benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates and tetrahydrocannabinol on all scan days), heart abnormalities (confirmed with electrocardiography), hypertension requiring medication or arrhythmia, pregnancy (confirmed with a urine pregnancy test) or breastfeeding, medications that may interact with methylphenidate (stimulants, analgesics containing narcotics, anorexics, antianginal agents, antiarrhythmics, corticosteroids, antibiotics, anticholinergics, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antidiarrheal, antifungal, antihistamines, antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory; antineoplastics, antiobesity, antipsychotics, antivirals, anxiolytics, hormones, insulin, lithium, muscle relaxants, psychotropic drugs, sedatives\/hypnotics), or ferromagnetic body implants that are contraindicated for MRI. \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nThe procedure for the study is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 . Each participant was scanned on 3 different days, 40\u2009\u00b1\u200935 days apart, under different pharmacological conditions: (1) oral-MP (60\u2009mg) and iv-placebo (3 cc saline), (2) oral-placebo and IV-MP (0.25\u2009mg\/kg in 3 cc sterile water), and (3) oral-placebo and iv-placebo. The session order was randomized and blocked across every six participants (for an example subject\u2019s session order, see Fig.\u00a0 ). Participants and the research staff were blind to medication (MP or PL) or route of administration (oral or IV). The key to the session order was held by independent personnel at the NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy until trial completion. Data were collected at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland from January 2018 to September 2021.    Experimental design.  \n A   Timeline of events. In each session, participants were given an oral dose of methylphenidate (MP) or placebo at time 0; the [ C] Raclopride bolus injection and simultaneous PET-fMRI scanning started at 30\u2009min; an IV dose of MP or placebo was given at 60\u2009min; and throughout the duration of the session participants used a button box in the scanner to self-report their experience of \u2018high\u2019 to the drug.   B   An example subject\u2019s session structure. Participants three separate imaging sessions on different days. Sessions were identical except for drug condition: (Session 1) oral PLA and IV PLA; (Session 2) oral MP (60\u2009mg) and IV PLA (3 cc saline); (Session 3) oral PLA and IV MP (0.25\u2009mg\/kg in 3 cc sterile water). The session order was counterbalanced across participants.   C   Analysis schema. With PET data, minute-to-minute changes in dopamine receptor binding were used to estimate the rate of dopamine increases in response to MP (decreases in D2 receptor binding following MP are a proxy for dopamine increases). With fMRI data, we calculated minute-to-minute changes in global brain connectivity across the scan session. We then performed multiple regression to identify global brain connectivity patterns that were temporally associated with slow and fast dopamine increases. Finally, we parcellated these maps to show how dopamine rate-associated patterns of global brain connectivity were distributed across large-scale brain functional networks. \n  \n\n\n### PET\/MRI acquisition \n  \nThe participants underwent simultaneous PET\/MRI imaging in a 3\u2009T Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens; Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). All studies were initiated at noon to minimize circadian variability. Venous catheters were placed in the left dorsal hand vein for radiotracer injection, and in the right dorsal hand vein for intravenous injection of medications. Heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) were continuously monitored throughout the study with an Expression MR400 patient monitor (Philips, Netherlands). Thirty minutes before tracer injection, either 60\u2009mg of MP or placebo was administered orally (p.o). The participant was then positioned in the scanner. Earplugs were used to minimize scanner noise and padding to minimize head motion. A T1 weighted dual-echo image was collected for attenuation correction using an ultrashort-TE (UTE) sequence (192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 matrix, 1.56\u2009mm isotropic resolution, TR\u2009=\u200911.94\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20090.07 and 2.46\u2009ms) for PET attenuation correction, and T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared gradient-echo (MPRAGE; TR\/TI\/TE\u2009=\u20092200\/1000\/4.25\u2009ms; FA\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, 1\u2009mm isotropic resolution) was used to map brain structure. List mode PET emission data were acquired continuously for 90\u2009min and initiated immediately after a manual bolus injection of [ C]raclopride (dose =15.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009mCi; duration 5\u201310\u2009s). Simultaneously, fMRI data were acquired continuously for 90\u2009min with a single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE\/TR\u2009=\u200930\/3000\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009192 \u00d7 192\u2009mm, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm, 1800 volumes, 36 slices\/volume, slice thickness = 4\u2009mm). Thirty minutes after [ C]raclopride injection, either 0.25\u2009mg\/kg MP or placebo was manually injected i.v. as a\u2009~30-s bolus. The participants were instructed to stay as still as possible and keep their eyes open during the scan. \n\n\n### High ratings \n  \nHigh rating prompts were displayed on a projector using a program (E-Prime Version 3.0) designed to minimize visual stimulation. A white cross was presented at central fixation on a black screen. Participants were instructed to stay awake, relax, look at the cross, and not think of anything in particular. Occasionally, the cross would turn into a number for 10\u2009s, and participants responded to the question: \u201cHow high do you feel right now, on a scale of 1\u201310, with 1 being minimum and 10 being maximum?\u201d. The first number presented at the start of each scanning session was always 1, and subsequent presentations matched the participant\u2019s high rating from the prior time point. Participants used a button box in their right hand to record responses. A button pressed with the right middle finger moved the rating up, one digit at a time, whereas the other button pressed with the right index moved it down. High rating prompts occurred every 5\u2009min from the onset of oral MP administration; then, at the onset of IV-MP administration, prompts occurred every minute for 20\u2009min. This faster sampling was chosen to capture the fast changes in reward during the first 20\u2009min after IV-MP administration [ ]; then, prompts occurred every 5\u2009min until the end of scanning. \n\n\n### MRI preprocessing \n  \nThe minimal preprocessing pipelines of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [ ] were used for image processing. Specifically, FreeSurfer 5.3.0 ( ) was used for automatic segmentation of anatomical MRI scans into cortical and subcortical gray matter ROIs [ ]. Then, for the EPI images, the FSL Software Library (version 5.0;  ) [ ] was used for rigid body realignment, field map processing, co-registration to the anatomical T1 image, and spatial normalization to MNI space. \n\nWe further processed the EPI images for fMRI analysis, including: regression of white matter, CSF, global signals, head motion parameters, and their derivatives using custom MATLAB code; and 5\u2009mm full-width at half-maximum spatial smoothing, using FSL. We also bandpass filtered the fMRI data in the 0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz frequency range. \n\n\n### PET image reconstruction \n  \nA 3-dimensional ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm [ ] with 3 iterations, 21 subsets, an all-pass filter, 344\u2009\u00d7\u2009344\u2009\u00d7\u2009127 matrix, and a model of the point spread function of the system was used for PET image reconstruction. The reconstructed PET time series consisted of 48 time windows (30 frames of 1\u2009min, followed by 12 frames of 2.5\u2009min, and 6 frames of 5\u2009min) each with 2.086-mm in-plane resolution and 2.032-mm slice thickness. Attenuation coefficients (\u03bc-maps) estimated from the UTE data using a fully convolutional neural network [ ] were used to correct for scattering and attenuation of the head, the MRI table, the gantry, and the radiofrequency coil. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) for [ C]raclopride were calculated after normalization for body weight and injected dose, co-registered with the structural T1w map, and spatially normalized to MNI space using parameters obtained from the HCP pipelines [ ]. Relative SUV time series, SUVr(  t  ), were computed in MNI space by normalizing each SUV volume by its mean SUV in cerebellum, as defined in individual FreeSurfer segmentations. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### PET image analysis: estimation of dynamic \u2018dopamine increases\u2019 to oral and IV MP \n  \nDecades of clinical and preclinical research have demonstrated that [ C]Raclopride is sensitive to synaptic dopamine concentration, as it has lower affinity for dopamine D -like receptors than endogenous dopamine [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, decreases in [ C]Raclopride binding following administration of a dopamine-boosting drug like MP are a suitable proxy for \u2018dopamine increases\u2019 [ ,  ]. \n\nSeveral groups have further found that one can model the time course of [ C]Raclopride binding to measure the temporal dynamics of dopamine receptor occupancy (and dynamics of dopamine increases in response to dopamine-boosting interventions such as MP). Some of the most popular methods include \u2018neurotransmitter PET\u2019 (ntPET) [ ], the \u2018linear simplified reference region model\u2019 (LSSRM) [ ] and the \u2018dynamic binding potential\u2019 [ ]. \n\nRecently, we developed a new approach to measure the temporal dynamics of dopamine changes optimally suited for the current experimental design [ ], which because of the PET\/MR setup, did not allow us to perform a continuous [11\u2009C]raclopride infusion as required by LSSRM (for a demonstration of the similarities between this method and prior methods, and for advantages of the current method for this particular study design, see the\u00a0 , including Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Briefly, we found that dynamic \u0394SUVr changes between placebo and MP conditions parallel the dynamics of striatal dopamine increases induced by MP as a function of time, which can be characterized by a gamma cumulative distribution function  To estimate the average time-varying dopamine increases to MP in the putamen we adjusted the amplitude,   A  , and the shape,   s  , parameters of the gamma cumulative distribution function. to fit   F  (t) to the average \u0394SUVr(t) data across the 20 participants with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear least-squares fitting in the interactive data language (IDL, L3Harris Geospatial, Boulder, CO). The corresponding probability density function,   f  (  t  ) = d  F  (  t  )\/d  t   was used to estimate the average rate of dopamine increases at 1-min temporal resolution, independently for oral- and IV-MP, and were used as the regressors of interest for subsequent GBC analyses. \n\n\n#### fMRI image analysis: GBC changes in response to slow and fast dopamine increases \n  \nWe computed GBC similar to prior work [ ,  ] using custom code in Python version 3.9.7 and the   nilearn   software package. For each subject, we extracted the fMRI time-series signal for each voxel in the brain, and then computed the correlation coefficient between one voxel with all other brain voxels, and Fisher Z-transformed the data. We repeated this process over every brain voxel, rendering whole-brain maps of the mean functional connectivity between one region and all other regions. To produce \u2018dynamic\u2019 GBC maps, we iterated this process across the 90-minute scanning session using a sliding window approach. Specifically, we calculated GBC across a sliding window of 5-minute bins with 4-minute overlap. This yielded a connectivity estimate for each minute of the scan (the actual number of timepoints of dynamic GBC was 82, due to inability to estimate connectivity for the first and last 4\u2009min of the session). \n\nTo identify how brain connectivity was associated with the rate of dopamine increases to slow (oral MP) vs. fast (IV MP) drug delivery, we performed whole-brain voxelwise multiple regression analysis of dynamic GBC images in SPM. We used   f  (  t  ), the PET-derived estimates of the rate of dynamic dopamine increases to oral and IV MP (average of all 20 participants), as the regressors of interest. Thus, for each individual and for the \u201cslow dopamine increase\u201d (oral MP) and \u201cfast dopamine increase\u201d (IV MP) sessions separately, we used the time course of slow and fast dopamine increases as regressors against the whole-brain voxelwise GBC maps. This temporal regression analysis yielded whole-brain maps showing where GBC was significantly associated with dynamic dopamine increases across time. We then subjected these maps (i.e., the contrast values from the multiple regression) to second-level analysis in SPM: one-sample   t   tests for each drug condition, and then paired   t   tests directly comparing fast versus slow dopamine-associated GBC maps (i.e., IV MP versus oral MP sessions). We also performed conjunction analysis to test for regions that showed overlapping GBC patterns to slow and fast dopamine increases. For whole-brain group level analyses, the significance threshold was set at voxelwise   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected, with a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected, and a minimum cluster size of   k  \u2009>\u200950, in line with current reporting guidelines [ ]. \n\nBecause we hypothesized opposing connectivity patterns for fast versus slow dopamine rate-associated GBC maps (i.e., IV MP versus oral MP sessions), we formally tested the spatial correspondence between these two voxelwise images, using spatial correlations. A simple spatial correlation of one fMRI image with another is not feasible because signals from every voxel are not statistically independent\u2014voxels that are nearby in space tend to be highly correlated with one another (i.e., fMRI connectivity images show \u2018spatial autocorrelation\u2019). Simple spatial correlations therefore yield artificially inflated correlation coefficients. To circumvent this, we used the   compare_images   command (with the   alexander_bloch   method) from the   neuromaps   package in Python [ ]. The method applies random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical fMRI data to create a null distribution with a similar spatial autocorrelation structure to the empirical fMRI data [ ]. Hence, we compared the spatial similarity of the maps showing the temporal association of GBC with fast dopamine increases (to IV MP) with the maps showing the temporal association of GBC with slow dopamine increases (to oral MP). The null distribution was created by permuting the fast dopamine rate-associated GBC maps 100 times. The spatial correlation of fast versus slow dopamine rate-associated GBC maps was deemed significant if it exceeded the top 5% of correlation coefficients in the null distribution. \n\nWe also hypothesized that fast compared to slow dopamine rate-associated GBC maps would be spatially correlated with the density of dopamine D1 receptors across the brain, since fast dopamine increases are more likely to stimulate low-affinity D1 receptors than slow dopamine increases [ \u2013 ], and because GBC is a marker sensitive to target receptor occupancy for drugs [ \u2013 ]. To test for this, we took a normative PET map of D1R density from the   neuromaps   repository (using [ C]SCH23390 data from Kaller et al. [ ]) and again used the   compare_images   command to spatially correlate this map with the map of the paired   t   test results (i.e., the fast versus slow dopamine rate-associated GBC maps). Because we did not have individual-level D1 receptor data for the subjects in this study, we consider this analysis preliminary and include the results in the\u00a0 . \n\n\n#### GBC and individual differences in drug \u2018high\u2019 \n  \nFinally, we sought to understand individual differences in the neurocircuitry behind the subjective experience of drug reward. We did not a priori hypothesize a single specific region whose dopamine rate-associated connectivity would be associated with \u2018high\u2019, so for exploratory testing we parcellated the GBC maps into large-scale functional networks based on the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab combined atlas in the   canlab   fMRI toolbox (canlab.github.io). This atlas includes 489 regions that can be aggregated into 23 large-scale networks. Since we did not a priori hypothesize specific subnetworks, we further reduced the number of comparisons by averaging across subnetworks (e.g., Default Mode A, B, and C were averaged to form a single Default Mode network). This resulted in 15 networks for final analysis. \n\nWe then performed robust \u2018skipped\u2019 correlations [ ] between dopamine rate-associated GBC estimates for each large-scale functional network and each individual\u2019s \u2018high\u2019 rating in response to MP, using the   Pingouin   package in Python [ ]. To get an aggregate single estimate of \u2018high\u2019 for each individual, we computed area under the curve of their \u2018high\u2019 ratings across the entire 90-min scan, using the composite trapezoidal rule with the   trapz   command in the   numpy   package in Python. Our primary focus for this analysis was on the IV MP (fast dopamine increase) session, since for the oral MP session only 13 participants rated some change in \u2018high\u2019 over the course of the scan (rated more than 1 out of 10 for at least one time point). To correct for multiple comparisons across all 15 functional brain networks, we performed Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe previously found that, as expected, dopamine increases to oral MP compared to IV MP started earlier (since oral MP was administered 30\u2009min prior to [ C]raclopride whereas IV MP was administered 30\u2009min post [ C]raclopride) and were slower and more modest than the fast and strong increases from IV MP. The derivative of the fitted gamma cumulative distribution function to the average delta SUVr(t) across subjects reflects the rate of dopamine increases (Fig.\u00a0 ), which we used for subsequent analyses to identify brain circuits that synergized with dopamine dynamics. \n\nWe tested where GBC was significantly associated with the rate of dopamine increases across time. For the regression with slow dopamine increases (oral MP), GBC showed positive associations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and negative associations in cingulate, insula, supplementary motor area, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and visual cortex (Fig.\u00a0 , top). For the regression with fast dopamine increases (IV MP), GBC showed largely the reverse pattern: there were negative associations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and positive associations in cingulate, insula, supplementary motor area, and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom). Since we hypothesized differential patterns of connectivity to slow versus fast dopamine increases, we formally tested for a spatial anticorrelation between the two GBC maps using spin-based permutation testing; results showed that GBC patterns to slow versus fast dopamine increases were indeed anticorrelated (rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.54,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, controlling for spatial autocorrelation; Fig.\u00a0 ). Conjunction analysis revealed that no regions had significant overlap in the connectivity changes to slow and fast dopamine increases. We then examined which functional networks showed the strongest change in association with rate of dopamine increases, for descriptive purposes only. GBC patterns to slow versus fast dopamine increases strongly diverged in several networks, notably the ventral attention network, somatomotor cortex, brainstem and diencephalon (Fig.\u00a0 ).    Brain connectivity changes to slow and fast dopamine increases show largely opposing patterns.  \n A   Group maps (one-sample   t   tests) depicting the fit between global brain connectivity (GBC) and slow (oral methylphenidate; top) or fast (intravenous methylphenidate; bottom) dopamine increase maps. Color bar represents   t   values.   B   The GBC maps to slow versus fast dopamine increases were significantly negatively correlated. Purple dots represent the null distribution (controlling for spatial autocorrelation); red dot is the observed correlation.   C   Parcellation of the maps from panel A into predefined large-scale functional networks. The open circles are beta values for each individual representing the fit between GBC and the speed of dopamine increases. Horizontal lines represent the group mean. Networks were grouped based on whether they generally fall within association cortices (blue); sensorimotor cortices (SM; orange); or subcortical regions (black). For more detailed visualization of these findings throughout the brain, please see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n  \n\nTo ensure that these findings were specific to the active drug conditions and not also present in the placebo session, we repeated these analyses using the dopamine rate-associated GBC maps from paired   t   tests (i.e., we performed the spatial correlation of the IV MP > Placebo GBC maps with the Oral MP > Placebo GBC maps). The findings were largely similar to the prior analysis and reported in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nWe next tested whether fast compared to slow dopamine rate-associated GBC patterns were spatially correlated with dopamine D1 receptor density across the brain. Indeed, the GBC patterns to fast versus slow dopamine increases were significantly positively correlated with a normative map of dopamine D1 receptor availability (rho = 0.22,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, controlling for spatial autocorrelation; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ; Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\nFinally, we considered whether GBC patterns to fast dopamine increases were correlated with individual differences in the \u2018high\u2019 to intravenous methylphenidate, in exploratory testing. Across all 15 networks, only the hippocampus showed a significant association with \u2018high\u2019 ratings (robust \u2018skipped\u2019 correlation:   r(  19)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.68, Bonferroni-corrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.015; Fig.\u00a0 ). This association was not present for hippocampal GBC responses to slow dopamine increases (  r(  19)\u2009=\u20090.262, uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.31), though we hesitate to interpret this null finding because only 13 of 20 individuals reported any \u2018high\u2019 to oral methylphenidate.    Network GBC changes to speed of dopamine increases and individual differences in subjective \u2018high\u2019 to methylphenidate.  \nIn exploratory testing, the hippocampus (and no other network) showed a significant correlation between GBC patterns to fast dopamine increases and \u2018high\u2019 ratings. The x-axis is the area under the curve (AUC) representing an aggregate measure of the total \u2018high\u2019 reported across the scanning session. The y-axis shows beta values for each participant demonstrating the association between fast dopamine increases and GBC. Note: in the oral session only 13 out of 20 participants reported feeling any \u2018high\u2019, so there may be floor effects for this session. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere we found strikingly divergent patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity to fast versus slow drug-induced dopamine increases. Differences were present in many large-scale brain networks and were spatially aligned with the regional cortical distribution of dopamine D1 receptor availability in the human brain. Further, the degree to which hippocampal connectivity tracked fast dopamine dynamics was associated with the intensity of \u2018high\u2019 ratings to MP. We discuss these findings in more detail below. \n\nA growing body of research has characterized the effects of stimulants like methylphenidate on the brain\u2019s functional architecture. Yet findings are disparate, in part because of differences across studies in route of administration, dosage, and analytic strategies. Prior studies examining functional connectivity changes following an acute dose of oral methylphenidate (inducing slow dopamine increases) have reported several findings relevant to our results. A 45\u2009mg dose increased global connectivity in primary motor cortex, and decreased it in lateral prefrontal cortex [ ], whereas a 20\u2009mg dose decreased global connectivity density in somatomotor regions including supplementary motor area, and reduced local connectivity density in thalamus [ ]. Both 60\u2009mg and 40\u2009mg doses decreased within-network connectivity in sensory and motor cortices [ ,  ], though another study that restricted analyses to regions enriched for the dopamine transporter found that a 20\u2009mg dose increased connectivity in motor cortex [ ]. In contrast, there are relatively few studies examining functional connectivity following an intravenous dose of a stimulant (inducing fast dopamine increases). A 0.5\u2009mg\/kg IV injection of methylphenidate increased connectivity between thalamus and cerebellum in healthy controls and in cannabis users [ ]. In contrast, a 0.57\u2009mg\/kg dose of IV cocaine (stimulant drug pharmacologically similar to MP) reduced connectivity in primary visual and motor cortex in cocaine users [ ]. Similarly, in rhesus monkeys with a history of chronic cocaine administration, self-administration of 0.3\u2009mg\/kg IV cocaine broadly decreased global connectivity across the brain [ ]. These varied findings suggest that changes in connectivity in response to stimulant drugs are likely to be influenced by prior exposures to those drugs. Additionally, species differences and the effects of self-administration versus experimenter administration might also contribute to divergent findings. \n\nHere, we replicated some of these results and found that connectivity patterns are crucially related to the dynamics of dopamine increases. The oral and IV doses in this study (60\u2009mg and 0.25\u2009mg\/kg, respectively) occupy roughly equivalent quantities of striatal dopamine transporters (~70%) in humans [ ,  ], and produce roughly the same overall magnitude of dopamine increases [ ]. Yet the connectivity patterns to slow and fast dopamine increases were opposing in most networks, and no regions showed significant overlap in connectivity patterns. Some of the global connectivity differences were in a similar direction to those of our prior study on BOLD signal changes, where we found that fast dopamine increases were associated with higher local activity in dorsal anterior cingulate and insula, and lower activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex [ ]. But some different patterns also emerged; for instance, we previously observed that slow dopamine increases were associated with lower BOLD activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex; whereas here we find that slow dopamine increases were associated with higher global connectivity in this same region. GBC compared to BOLD signal activity also exhibited more widespread differences based on dopamine kinetics: fast compared to slow dopamine increases were associated with greater connectivity in midbrain\/brainstem, thalamus, and head of caudate, and lower connectivity in ventral striatum. Notably, some studies found that D1 density is highest in the head of caudate while D2 density is more evenly distributed across the striatum [ ,  ], whereas D3 receptors, which have high affinity for dopamine and like D2 receptors are inhibitory, have very high densities in the nucleus accumbens (located in ventral striatum) [ ,  ]. The differing spatial distributions of receptor subtypes may explain the opposing connectivity patterns between striatal subregions, as dopamine receptors densities shape functional connectivity within discrete cortico-striatal-midbrain circuits [ \u2013 ]. \n\nStill, an open question remains: how exactly is GBC sensitive to route of MP administration? Broadly, GBC appears to capture changes in large-scale neuronal communication following drug-induced changes in neurotransmitter binding to receptors [ ,  ], a finding that was recently established in studies of 10 different mind-altering drugs including MP [ ]. They found that (1) changes in GBC following drug challenges could be predicted based on the distribution of target receptors\/transporters and that (2) changes were organized along the unimodal\/transmodal gradient hierarchy in neocortex [ ]. We likewise found generally divergent patterns along this hierarchy: fast dopamine increases were associated with increased GBC in transmodal association cortices (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and with decreased GBC in primary visual and motor cortices (and vice versa for slow dopamine increases) consistent with the relative cortical distribution of D1 to D2 receptors in the human brain [ ]. A notable exception was the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which showed a GBC pattern opposite to that of other transmodal cortical regions, including an opposite pattern to the association with the regional distribution of D1 receptor availability. Intriguingly the ventromedial prefrontal cortex also has high levels of D3 receptors [ ] so its distinct responses might have reflected the relative distribution not just of D1R and D2R but also D3R. We had previously shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was sensitive to expectation effects in healthy participants anticipating to receive IV MP [ ], which might have also contributed in the current study to its distinct response from that of other transmodal cortices. Interestingly, in rat infralimbic cortex (a roughly homologous region to the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex), fast infusion of cocaine (5\u2009s injection) in cocaine na\u00efve animals was associated with strong increases in   c-fos   and   arc   mRNA expression, whereas slower infusions (25\u2009s or 100\u2009s injections) did not produce measurable changes [ ]. The authors speculated that this may be a critical marker of experience-dependent plasticity that drugs evoke when they enter the brain very quickly and hence have addictive potential. Future preclinical studies could test whether such changes in immediate early gene expression are associated with changes in measures of whole-brain functional network communication such as GBC, as well as the role of the various dopamine receptors in such changes. \n\nSince previous studies found that GBC has strong spatial correspondence with drug-induced changes in target receptor occupancy [ \u2013 ], we formally tested the spatial correlation between D1 receptor availability and functional connectivity changes to dopamine rate, in an exploratory analysis ( ). We reasoned that fast dopamine increases would increase GBC in a pattern spatially aligned with D1 receptor availability, since fast compared to slow dopamine increases would more likely stimulate the low-affinity D1 receptors [ \u2013 ]. Indeed, fast but not slow dopamine increases induced global connectivity changes with spatial correspondence to D1 receptors except as discussed before in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These data provide preliminary evidence for models on how dopamine receptor occupancy shapes the fMRI response [ ] and on our prior work showing that the cortical D1-D2 receptor ratio is strongly associated with functional activity and connectivity responses to MP [ ]. They also reinforce support for GBC as a noninvasive measure with strong biological relevance for the effects of acute drug interventions [ ,  ]. However, we stress that these findings are preliminary because the D1 receptor maps were derived from normative data outside of the current study. This analysis should therefore be replicated in another sample where D1 receptor data are available for the same individuals who have GBC data. \n\nOut of 15 functional networks tested, only the hippocampus GBC response to fast dopamine increases showed a significant association with intensity of \u2018high\u2019 ratings across participants. This was notable because the average GBC association with fast dopamine increases was near zero. However, there was considerable individual variability, and those with decreases in hippocampal GBC tended to experience the strongest \u2018high\u2019 to IV MP. The hippocampus may be important for attributing the experience of reward to a particular context; GABAergic inhibitory signals from the hippocampus disinhibit midbrain dopamine neurons and are necessary for cocaine-seeking behavior in rodents [ ,  ]. This circuit has also been observed in humans via functional connectivity analysis [ ]. Interestingly, when patients with opioid use disorder were inhibiting craving during drug cue exposure, hippocampal activity increased [ ]. More broadly, a growing literature suggests that chronic psychostimulant use induces neuroadaptations in the hippocampus that promote relapse vulnerability (for a review, see [ ]). For instance, among people with cocaine use disorder in residential treatment, heightened regional cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus (and no other brain region) predicted relapse in the coming month [ ]. The current data add to this body of evidence and suggests that hippocampal connectivity during a person\u2019s first intravenous MP exposure may modulate their sensitivity to the rewarding experience from the drug. \n\nFinally, whereas the fast dopamine increases with IV MP were associated with increased connectivity throughout most functional networks it was associated with decreased connectivity in the limbic network; this was a pattern opposite to that observed in association with the slow dopamine increases with oral MP. Since the limbic network comprises the ventromedial prefrontal cortex as well as the temporal pole and the hippocampus, the decreased connectivity of this network is likely to be driven by the distinct response of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. \n\nThere are several limitations to note. First, the cost-intensive nature of this study and its methodological complexity restricted the sample size, which limited our ability to perform certain analyses. For instance, only 13 of 20 individuals reported experiencing any \u2018high\u2019 to the oral dose of MP. In future larger samples, it will be interesting to test whether the hippocampus or other networks have a GBC response to slow dopamine increases that explains individual differences in drug reward to oral MP. Second, the dynamic PET data is a relatively noisy measure at the individual subject level compared to the group level, and therefore we were limited to using the average speed of dopamine increases rather than individual-level dopamine measures. Third, our experimental design has relatively low ecological validity since an experimenter-administered drug exposure in a scanner is a different experience than self-administration in a person\u2019s preferred environment. The context of exposure impacts the rewarding properties of drugs [ \u2013 ] and the brain dopaminergic response [ \u2013 ]. Fourth, oral and IV drug administrations may vary on other unmeasured factors aside from the speed of dopamine increases, such as differences in MP metabolism when administered orally versus IV. However, in a prior analysis of this dataset [ ] we confirmed that the oral and IV MP doses elicited similar overall striatal dopamine increases supporting the interpretation that the differences we observed are driven by the rate of dopamine change. Still, IV MP likely elicits a greater peak dopamine increase than oral MP, which we hypothesize could also contribute to greater D1R stimulation and unique connectivity patterns. Peak norepinephrine levels may likewise be higher for IV MP than oral MP. Therefore, while here we estimated connectivity changes based on the rate of dopamine increases to different MP administrations, we cannot definitively rule out that other differences between IV and oral MP played a role in the findings. Lastly, these participants were healthy adults with limited illicit drug use; while the initial subjective response to drugs does seem to be relevant for future chronic use [ ] it remains unclear if the brain responses to fast and slow dopamine increases would be similar in individuals with a substance use disorder. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11039764,"text_md5":"135e645aa70f3c8b74ebce1e80a89148","field_positions":{"authors":[0,128],"journal":[129,152],"publication_year":[154,158],"title":[169,234],"keywords":[248,265],"abstract":[278,2209],"body":[2218,43886]},"batch":2,"pmid":38326458,"doi":"10.1038\/s41386-024-01803-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11039764","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11039764"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11039764\">11039764<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11039764  Brain connectivity changes to fast versus slow dopamine increases"}
{"text":"Bu, Xuan and Gao, Yingxue and Liang, Kaili and Chen, Ying and Guo, Lanting and Huang, Xiaoqi\nPsychoradiology, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nInvestigation of white matter functional networks underlying different behavioral profiles in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder\n\n# Keywords\n\nattention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder\nwhite matter function\nbrain network\nresting-state fMRI\nclustering\npsychopathology\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nCortical functional network alterations have been widely accepted as the neural basis of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recently, white matter has also been recognized as a novel neuroimaging marker of psychopathology and has been used as a complement to cortical functional networks to investigate brain\u2013behavior relationships. However, disorder-specific features of white matter functional networks (WMFNs) are less well understood than those of gray matter functional networks. In the current study, we constructed WMFNs using a new strategy to characterize behavior-related network features in ADHD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe recruited 46 drug-na\u00efve boys with ADHD and 46 typically developing (TD) boys, and used clustering analysis on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to generate WMFNs in each group. Intrinsic activity within each network was extracted, and the associations between network activity and behavior measures were assessed using correlation analysis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nNine WMFNs were identified for both ADHD and TD participants. However, boys with ADHD showed a splitting of the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network and lacked a cognitive control network. In addition, boys with ADHD showed increased activity in the dorsal attention network and somatomotor network, which correlated positively with attention problems and hyperactivity symptom scores, respectively, while they presented decreased activity in the frontoparietal network and frontostriatal network in association with poorer performance in response inhibition, working memory, and verbal fluency. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe discovered a dual pattern of white matter network activity in drug-na\u00efve ADHD boys, with hyperactive symptom-related networks and hypoactive cognitive networks. These findings characterize two distinct types of WMFN in ADHD psychopathology. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in school-age children and adolescents with a worldwide prevalence of 3.4% (Polanczyk   et al  .,  ). Numerous neuroimaging studies have outlined the role of cortical functional network abnormalities observed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) (Gao   et al  .,  ; Sutcubasi   et al  .,  ). For example, poor top-down control over inhibition and attention may be due to functional changes in the fronto-striato-cerebellar network while impulsivity symptoms are mainly associated with altered functional connectivity in the reward network (Faraone   et al  .,  ). \n\nAs white matter connects gray matter regions and supports effective communication across brain networks, white matter function as detected by blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) signals from rs-fMRI has recently been demonstrated to have physiological significance (Ji   et al  .,  ). The rationale for these studies depends on the fact that white matter also has the vascular capacity to support spiking-induced hemodynamic changes that can be detected by rs-fMRI, albeit on a smaller scale than hemodynamic changes in gray matter (Gawryluk   et al  .,  ). In addition, some studies (Ding   et al  .,  ; Li   et al  .,  ) further revealed that the intensity of the BOLD signal in white matter could be modulated by task stimulation and was associated with neural activity. \n\nMore recent studies have begun to demonstrate that there are reliable and stable white matter functional networks (WMFNs) that resemble gray matter functional networks in organization and small-world topology, and spatially overlap with several major white matter tracts (Peer   et al  .,  ; Li   et al  .,  ; Wang   et al  .,  ). WMFN disturbances have been reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy (Jiang   et al  .,  ; Jiang   et al  .,  ; Fan   et al  .,  ). In addition, the topological properties of WMFNs can predict the severity of depressive symptoms and discriminate depressive patients from controls, yielding potential clinical value (Li   et al  .,  ). Therefore, WMFNs provide important complementary information on how intrinsic neural activity in white matter interacts and organizes itself; this information is useful for decoding human behavior and cognition, which can provide insight into the underlying neural mechanisms of psychopathology. Researchers usually define WMFNs using a clustering approach in healthy participants and patients combined. While this method amplifies the sample size and increases the statistical power of the clustering algorithm, it may obscure the unique features in patients and compromise the ability to reflect disorder-specific networks. In addition, when clustering is performed on a combined group of patients and controls with greatly imbalanced numbers, the results may heavily rely on the group with a large sample size and lead to bias. \n\nHeterogeneity may be the most challenging of the current issues in the field of neuroimaging. Previous results of neuroimaging studies on ADHD were usually affected by gender, drug effect, illness course, and symptom profiles. For example, we found that white matter microstructure differs between boys and girls with ADHD (Lin   et al  .,  ; Lin   et al  .,  ). Medication is another commonly seen as a confounding factor, as both stimulants and nonstimulants, such as atomoxetine, have modulatory effects on intrinsic brain activity in patients with ADHD (Pereira-Sanchez   et al  .,  ). Illness course and developmental trajectory are also factors that may interfere with the results. Studies conducted on patients in late adolescence or early adulthood are less likely to capture various neural substrates, since various neural processes can occur during childhood and early adolescence (Shaw and Sudre,  ; Sudre   et al  .,  ). \n\nIn light of the combined evidence, we decided to explore the organization of WMFNs in boys with and without ADHD as two separate groups. We recruited 46 medication-na\u00efve boys with ADHD and the same number of typically developing (TD) boys (age range 7\u201316 years) to exclude the influence of drugs and gender. The current study bears the advantage of homogeneity of participants and exclusion of drug and gender effects. We hypothesized that ADHD would exhibit characteristic WMFNs when clustered separately and that altered functional networks would be associated with specific clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## Methods and Materials \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants were recruited from the Mental Health Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, from June 2009 to July 2013. In total, 105 participants, including 55 boys with ADHD and 50 TD boys, were recruited in this study. The ADHD diagnoses were given according to the DSM-IV by an experienced psychiatrist. TD boys underwent screening using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Non-patient Edition, and their first-degree relatives reported no history of psychiatric illness. All participants included were right-handed, confirmed by Annett's Hand Preference Questionnaire, and had a full-scale IQ above 80. The exclusion criteria for all participants were: (i) any current or past history of other psychiatry disorders; (ii) any history of neurologic disorders or neurosurgery; and (iii) any history of treatment for ADHD or other psychotropic medications. We excluded 11 children (ADHD\u00a0=\u00a07, TD\u00a0=\u00a04) with translation\u00a0>2 mm and rotation\u00a0>2\u00b0 during scanning and two ADHD children with failed fMRI scanning. A final sample composed of 46 boys with ADHD and 46 TD boys was analyzed. See Table\u00a0  for demographic and clinical details. \n  \nDemographic and clinical features of the participants. \n  \nPrior to study, legal guardians provided written informed consent. Study approval was given by the ethics committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. \n\n\n### Clinical, behavioral and cognitive assessment \n  \nWe used the Chinese version of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) to characterize ADHD symptoms. It includes 48 items and comprises six subscales: Conduct Problems, Psychosomatic, Anxiety, Study Problems, Hyperactivity\u2013Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity Index. \n\nThe Chinese version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess comprehensive behavior problems. This instrument, which records a wide range of behavioral problems and competencies of children aged 4 to 16 years, includes the following eight subscales: withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety\/depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior. \n\nA set of neuropsychological tests was applied to evaluate multiple aspects of executive function, including the Stroop color\u2013word test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Digit Span Test, and Verbal Fluency Test. Details about the neuropsychological tests are provided in the  . \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImaging data were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Trio scanner with an eight-channel head coil. T1-weighted images were acquired by using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time\/echo time\u00a0=\u00a01900\/2.5 ms; inversion time\u00a0=\u00a0900 ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0; matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256; field of view\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 mm; number of sagittal slices\u00a0=\u00a0176; and slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01 mm. The resting-state fMRI images were acquired by using a 7-minute gradient\u2010echo echo\u2010planar functional imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time\/echo time\u00a0=\u00a02000\/30 ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u2009 \u00d7 \u200964; field of view\u00a0=\u00a0240\u2009 \u00d7 \u2009240\u2009mm, number of axial slices\u00a0=\u00a030; slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a05 mm with no slice gap; and voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03.75\u2009 \u00d7 \u20093.75\u2009 \u00d7 \u20095 mm . The participants were asked to stay still and close their eyes but avoid thinking of anything or falling asleep during scanning. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing was performed using DPABI ( ) and open MATLAB scripts ( ). First, removing the first five volumes of fMRI scans. Next, slice-timing correction and realignment were performed. T1 images were then coregistered to the functional images, and then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using DARTEL. Linear trends were removed from functional images to correct for signal drift. The mean cerebrospinal fluid signals and 24-parameter motion parameters (six rigid-body motion parameters, their values at the previous time point and the 12 corresponding squared values) were regressed out from functional data. The white matter and global brain signals were not regressed out to avoid elimination of important neural signals. To minimize the potential effects of head motion, we also applied temporal scrubbing using motion \u2018spikes\u2019 (framewise displacement\u00a0>0.2 mm) as separate repressors to effectively censor the data at the spike. Bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) was performed to reduce minimize high-frequency physiological noise. Subsequently, spatial smoothing (4-mm FWHM) on the white matter and gray matter separately to avoid mixing their signals. Finally, the functional images were then spatially normalized into the Montreal Neurologic Institute space by T1 segmentation and were resampled into 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm . We also analyzed the head motion differences between boys with ADHD and TD boys using a two-sample   t   test, and the result showed no difference in head motion between the two groups ( ). \n\n\n### Construction of WMFNs \n  \nIn this study, we used a data-driven approach, clustering, to construct WMFNs separately for the ADHD and TD groups. The analysis pipeline and details were described in previous studies (Peer   et al  .,  ; Bu   et al  .,  ). First, white matter masks were created for two groups separately to select voxels for clustering. Specifically, only voxels identified as white matter and contained functional data across >80% of participants were retained. Then, a voxel-wise Pearson's correlation matrix of white matter was computed for each participant and was averaged for each group to create two group-level correlation matrixes. Finally,   K  -means clustering was performed separately on the two correlation matrixes to identify the clusters of white matter voxels with similar functional connectivity patterns. The number of clusters ranged from 2 to 22, and the stability of clustering was evaluated by Dice's coefficient (the threshold was set at 0.90). \n\n\n### Activity of WMFNs \n  \nAmplitudes at each frequency were extracted using Fourier transform from each white matter network for each participant. The frequency\u2013power graph for each network was produced by averaging across participants in each group. For each white matter network, the averaged amplitudes were obtained for each participant to represent the network activity and were then used to perform a two-sample   t   test. We used Bonferroni correction to address multiple comparisons across several white matter networks.   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 was used to determine significance. \n\n\n### Correlations between WMFNs and clinical measures \n  \nWe further examined the associations between significant network activity and several clinical measures (CPRS scores, CBCL scores, and cognitive function scores) by Pearson correlation analysis. We used false discovery rate (FDR) correction to address multiple correlation analysis.   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 was used to determine significance. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Organization of WMFNs \n  \nUsing   K  -means clustering on the white matter correlation matrixes, we identified nine stable and reasonable white matter functional networks for ADHD and TD boys according to Dice's coefficient (Fig.\u00a0 ). Then, we qualitatively defined the white matter networks according to the correspondence between our white matter networks and the known resting-state gray matter networks (Yeo   et al  .,  ). The identified networks were the default-mode network (DMN), the somatomotor network (SMN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the visual network, the deep frontoparietal network (FPN), the deep frontal network, the frontostriatal network, the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network, and the cognitive control network (CCN). Notably, compared with TD boys, the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network in ADHD split into two subnetworks, and the CCN was not present in ADHD. The detailed organization of the nine networks is presented in Fig.\u00a0 . \n  \nStable white matter functional networks for ADHD and TD boys according to Dice's coefficient: (A, C) for ADHD and (B, D) for TD boys. \n    \nThe nine WMFNs identified for ADHD and TD boys using the   K  -means clustering method. Seven shared networks were found in both groups of participants: (1) the default-mode white matter network, (2) the somatomotor white matter network, (3) the dorsal attention white matter network, (4) the visual white matter network, (5) the deep frontoparietal white matter network, (6) the deep frontal white matter network, and (7) the frontostriatal white matter network. In ADHD, however, the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network was split into two subnetworks, and the cognitive control network was not present. \n  \n\n### Activity of WMFNs \n  \nThe amplitudes in WMFNs are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Most networks displayed a decreasing trend in amplitude with increased frequency, suggesting greater activity in white matter at lower frequencies, except for the DAN and CCN in TD boys exhibiting consistent activity across the whole frequency. \n  \nSignal amplitude for hyperactive (A), hypoactive (B), and nonsignificant (C) WMFNs. The left panel illustrates power\u2013frequency graphs showing spontaneous neural activity in each white matter network. The right panel shows differences in the average amplitude of each network between ADHD and TD boys. Asterisks represent significant differences (*  P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, Bonferroni corrected). \n  \nTo compare the network activity between the two groups, we combined the amplitudes of two subnetworks in ADHD, namely the inferior corticospinal network and cerebellum network. Compared with TD boys, boys with ADHD showed increased amplitudes in the SMN, DAN, and visual network (Fig.\u00a0 ) but reduced amplitudes in the deep FPN, frontostriatal network, and inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Correlation between WMFNs and clinical phenotypes \n  \nWe next explored the relationship of altered network activity with symptoms, behavior, and cognitive function across all participants. We found that increased activity of the SMN correlated positively with the hyperactivity\u2013impulsivity score (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.25,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and the hyperactivity index (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.33,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.007) in the CPRS; increased activity of the DAN correlated positively with study problems in the CPRS (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.37,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and attention problems in the CBCL (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.45,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig.\u00a0 ,  ). \n  \nCorrelation between hyperactive networks and symptoms (A, B) and between hypoactive networks and cognitive deficits (C, D). (  P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FDR corrected). \n  \nOn the other hand, decreased activity of the deep FPN and frontostriatal network was linked to deficits in cognition (including poor inhibitory control), working memory, and verbal fluency (Fig.\u00a0 ,  ): activity of the deep FPN was correlated negatively with interference time in the Stroop test (  r   = \u22120.34,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and positively with the digit span (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.28,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.042) and verbal fluency score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.30,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.009); similarly, activity of the frontostriatal network correlated negatively with interference time in the Stroop test (  r   = \u22120.34,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and positively with the digit span (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.26,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.042) and verbal fluency score (  r  \u00a0=\u00a00.31,   P  -FDR corrected\u00a0=\u00a00.009). \n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nIn the current study, we characterized the functional organization and activity of white matter networks in boys with and without ADHD based on BOLD signals from white matter. The current study yielded two main findings. First, nine WMVNs were identified for both ADHD and TD boys; however, ADHD showed the breakdown of the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network and the lack of CCN compared with TD boys. Second, compared with TD boys, ADHD boys showed higher amplitudes of BOLD signals in the SMN, DAN, and visual network and lower amplitudes in the deep FPN, frontostriatal network and inferior corticospinal network. Moreover, the SMN and DAN positively correlated with symptom scores, while the FPN and frontostriatal network were associated with cognitive performance. In summary, our findings demonstrated symptom- and cognition-related WM networks, which may be the specific neural mechanism underlying ADHD. \n\n\n### Disrupted WMFN organization \n  \nPrevious studies have demonstrated alterations in white matter microstructure in several fasciculi and cortical networks, and we further explored the functional activity of white matter in patients with ADHD from a network point of view. The number of networks (  K  ) for which the Dice coefficient was >0.9 was   K  \u00a0=\u00a02, 4, 6, and 9 for both groups. We defined the white matter network organization according to Yeo's canonical gray matter functional network and chose nine white matter functional networks as our target networks for further analysis. ADHD boys differ from TD boys in that the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network is split into two subnetworks and the CCN is absent. \n\nThe splitting of the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network into two subnetworks suggested disruption of functional connectivity within the motor\u2013cerebellar system in boys with ADHD, which also represents functional segregation in the motor\u2013cerebellar system in ADHD. The corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network, which starts from the cortex, passes through the pons and ends at the cerebellum, and plays an important role in motor and cognition-related information processing. Previous fMRI studies detected reduced connectivity not only in the cerebellum but also between the cerebellum and various regions of the cerebral cortex in ADHD (Tomasi and Volkow,  ; O'Halloran   et al  .,  ). Damage to the cerebellum and its related circuit\/network during development can have negative long-term effects on movement, cognition, and affective regulation (Stoodley,  ). Our findings on the breakdown of the white matter corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network suggested that dysfunction of structural connectivity within the cortico-cerebellar circuit may contribute to the inability to integrate and process information within the circuit and result in poor motor coordination and cognitive flexibility. \n\nLack of CCN in WMFNs is another important finding in the current study. It provides direct evidence for the network alteration related to the deficits in cognitive control that underline the core symptoms in ADHD. Decreased GM functional connectivity in the CCN correlated with lower accuracy during the go\/no-go task and can be used to efficiently differentiate ADHD patients from healthy controls (Cai   et al  .,  ), while increased functional connectivity in the CCN has been associated with symptom relief in remitted ADHD (Francx   et al  .,  ). The lack of a CCN WMFN in boys with ADHD revealed in the current study using a data-driven method gave additional evidence for the disruption of this network. It also emphasized that this network may have a fundamental role in the neural pathology of boys with ADHD. \n\n\n### Hyperactive white matter networks \n  \nWe found two symptom-related high-function white matter networks in boys with ADHD, which are increased SMN activity linked to impulsivity\/hyperactivity symptoms and DAN activity related to poor attention. Dysfunction of the gray matter sensorimotor network has been shown to contribute to ADHD pathophysiology. Patients with ADHD had higher values of both degree centrality and functional connectivity in the motor and visual cortices (Wang   et al  .,  ; Di Martino   et al  .,  ). Referring to the motor network of gray matter, McLeod   et al  . ( ) reported stronger within-hemisphere functional connections among several motor cortices, including primary and sensory motor cortices and precentral and postcentral gyri. We observed higher intrinsic function in the motor and visual WMFNs, and it correlated with a higher score of impulsivity\u2013hyperactivity. This highlights the role of the SMN in ADHD core symptoms, such as hyperactivity, from the function of the structural network. \n\nThe DAN is involved in top-down attention control and is usually activated during high-demand situations. In the current study, we detected elevated function in white matter within the DAN and its correlation with study and attention problems in boys with ADHD. We assume this represents the increased demand of this particular network for ADHD. Individuals with ADHD are prone to distraction and mind wandering; thus, they may need more activity from the attention network to sustain the concentration, which leads to increased activity in white matter DAN. The more severe the inattention symptoms that exist, the higher intrinsic activity in the DAN network will be needed. This compensatory higher neural activity in ADHD may result from the low efficiency of the neural system, as patients need to consume more energy to complete a task (Fassbender and Schweitzer,  ). \n\n\n### Hypoactive white matter networks \n  \nApart from hyperactive WMFNs, we also observed hypoactivity in the FPN and frontostriatal network, which are cognition-related functional networks. It has been suggested that executive function can be distinguished as cool and hot. Cool executive function is predominantly involved in non-emotional cognitive control and is regulated by the FPN. The FPN comprises the lateral frontal pole, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, anterior insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (Vincent   et al  .,  ). This network is linked to cognitive control processes, including goal-directed behavior, response inhibition, working memory, and set shifting (Menon,  ). Impairment in executive control is one of the characteristic presentations in ADHD. Previous studies demonstrated that ADHD patients showed decreased activity in FPN regions during tasks that place high demands on executive control (Durston   et al  .,  ; Smith   et al  .,  ; Rubia,  ). Our finding of lower intrinsic activity in white matter within the FPN and its correlation with worse performance on the Stroop and digit span tasks gave direct evidence of functional disruption of this network, which contributes to response inhibition and working memory deficits. \n\nIn contrast, hot executive function relates to highly motivating and emotional situations that depend on the frontostriatal network, comprising the ventral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and limbic system (Cubillo   et al  .,  ). It is postulated that due to motivation deficits, ADHD individuals have delay aversion, which means preferring immediate rewards to long-term rewards and ultimately leads to impulsivity and hyperactivity symptoms (Sonuga-Barke,  ). Previous fMRI studies reported lower functional activity within the ventral frontostriatal network during reward tasks (Plichta and Scheres,  ). Our finding of reduced intrinsic activity of white matter within the frontostriatal network and its correlation with poor performance in the Stroop task, digit span, and verbal fluency test suggested involvement of the frontostriatal network in cool executive function, while its contribution to hot executive function remains to be investigated in the future. The hypoactivity of white matter in both the FPN and the frontostriatal network highlights the essential role they play in cognitive function, especially in the etiology of cognitive dysfunction in ADHD. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations should be considered in the current study. First, to reduce confounding effects, we included drug-na\u00efve boys without any comorbidities. Although this helps to discover the fundamental role of specific networks in ADHD, it may be difficult to generalize to routine clinical patients. Second, our sample size is relatively small for the clustering algorithm, which may hinder the robustness of the results. However, despite the small sample size, the results withstood correction for multiple comparisons, etc., which also supports the reliability of our results. Of course, further validation with a larger sample will be needed to prove the stability of our findings. Third, given the complexity of white matter fibers, it is difficult to determine exactly which fasciculus is the source of the white matter BOLD signal. Combining tractography with white matter network analysis will help researchers identify the relationship between white matter fasciculi and WMFNs. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the current study, we proposed a modified data-driven method to cluster white matter intrinsic networks. We proposed symptomatology-related networks and cognitive networks in boys with ADHD. We found that boys with ADHD presented a characteristic disruption of both the inferior corticospinal\u2013cerebellar network and CCN. In addition, we demonstrated hyperactive symptom-related networks (i.e. the SMN and DAN) and hypoactive cognition-related networks (i.e. the FPN and frontostriatal network), which may underline the neural mechanism of core symptoms in boys with ADHD. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10917226,"text_md5":"508103b857c77052812bf70a16e90625","field_positions":{"authors":[0,92],"journal":[93,108],"publication_year":[110,114],"title":[125,259],"keywords":[273,396],"abstract":[409,2324],"body":[2333,28067]},"batch":3,"pmid":38665605,"doi":"10.1093\/psyrad\/kkac012","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917226","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10917226"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917226\">10917226<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10917226  Investigation of white matter functional networks underlying different behavioral profiles in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder"}

Additionally, we further explored the associations between abnormal FC and clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOne\u2010way analysis of covariance showed significant FC differences among the three groups. Post\u2010hoc analysis showed that patients with RD exhibited decreased FC between left OP2 and regions of left angular gyrus (AG), thalamus, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) in comparison with HCs. In addition, compared with patients without RD, patients with RD showed decreased FC between left OP2 and regions of left MFG, AG, middle temporal gyrus, and right CPL. Moreover, in patients with RD, the FC between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of RD, and the FC between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of BPPV. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition; These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition. \n\n  \nBPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition; These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vertigo disease.  Epidemiology showed that the lifetime prevalence of BPPV was 2.4%, the annual prevalence was 1.6%, and the annual incidence was 0.6%.  Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) is the most important treatment for BPPV, which removes the otolith from the affected semicircular canal and gets rid of vertigo instantly upon most occasions.  However, 31% to 61% of BPPV patients still suffer from residual dizziness (RD) lasting a few weeks to several months after successful CRP. These BPPV patients with RD usually complain of a non\u2010specific dizziness, imbalance, or unsteadiness, without positional vertigo and nystagmus. ,  \n\nCurrently, the potential neural mechanism of RD remains unclear. Some studies considered that the occurrence of RD was attributed to incomplete central nervous system adaptation and compensatory. ,   A recent resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study suggested that patients with BPPV exhibited increased fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in region of pons, functional changes in pons might reflect central adaptation and compensatory after repeated attacks of episodic vertigo.  Previous studies have also shown that the vestibular nucleus of the pons might play an important role in central compensation in patients with unilateral external vestibular damage or in rats model of acute unilateral labyrinthotomy. ,   In central vestibular pathway, it was confirmed that the vestibular nucleus relies on vestibular information to the vestibular cortex through the thalamus.  It was reported that the parieto\u2010insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) was the core of the human vestibular cortex, and parietal operculum cortex 2 (OP2) was the core of PIVC and was considered to be the primary vestibular cortical region in humans. ,   Thus, it is reasonable to think that the vestibular nucleus relies on vestibular information to the OP2 through the thalamus, and the functional changes in pons (vestibular nucleus) in patients with BPPV may indicate abnormal functional activity of the OP2. However, it is currently not clear whether BPPV patients with RD showed abnormal functional activity of the OP2. \n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the alterations in resting\u2010state functional connectivity (FC) focused on the bilateral OP2 and to determine whether these changes in FC correlate with certain clinical features in BPPV patients with RD after successful CRP. We hypothesize that the neural mechanism of RD involves functional changes in brain pathways through the OP2, and the altered FC of OP2 may potentially become an imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of RD in patients with BPPV. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nBetween March 2020 and June 2023, 165 right\u2010handed subjects were recruited at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, including 55 BPPV patients with RD, 55 BPPV patients without RD, and 55 healthy volunteers. The BPPV patients were diagnosed using the criterion established by B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society in 2015.  Prior to enrollment, all patients underwent routine neuro\u2010otological interrogations and examinations to exclude secondary BPPV resulting from vestibular neuritis (VN), Meniere's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), or head trauma. Patients with central nervous system disorders, psychiatric, or systemic disorders were excluded. BPPV with superior semicircular canal (SSC) or multi\u2010canal (MC) are rare. It was reported that SSC\u2010BPPV accounts for 1% to 3% of cases and the MC\u2010BPPV accounted for no more than 5% of patients with BPPV. ,   In addition, according to a recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, the affected side, location, or type of semicircular canal involvement have no concern with the occurrence of RD.  Therefore, we only included BPPV patients with unilateral posterior semicircular canal (PSC) or horizontal semicircular canal (HSC); patients with MC or SSC were excluded. \n\nOnce diagnosed, patients with PSC\u2010BPPV were treated with Epley's maneuver  or Semont maneuver ,   and patients with HSC\u2010BPPV were treated by Barbecue rotation maneuver (geotropic lateral canal BPPV)  or Gufoni maneuver (apogeotropic lateral canal BPPV). ,   A Dix\u2013Hallpike or supine\u2010roll test was performed 1\u2009h after CRP to ensure a successful treatment. ,   After a successful CRP, the following demographic and clinical data were collected, including age, sex, educational years, affected side, involved semicircular canal, and duration of BPPV before successful CRP. In addition, scores of dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) and vertigo visual analog scale (VVAS) before successful CRM were collected. Then, all patients experienced 1\u2009week follow\u2010up evaluation through interviews. During the interviews, the identification of RD symptoms was performed. Scores of DHI and dizziness VAS (DVAS) for patients with RD after successful CRP were recorded. All patients with and without RD underwent resting\u2010state fMRI scanning. In addition, the duration of RD symptoms for each patient with RD was collected. As symptoms of BPPV or RD may lead to anxiety and depression, some patients may even transition to persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD, a chronic functional vestibular disorder which is characterized by persistent non\u2010rotational dizziness and instability combined with anxiety and depression lasting more than 3\u2009months).  All patients were assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) during the follow\u2010up; patients with scores of HAMA\u2009>\u200914 or HAMD\u2009>\u200917 were excluded. Patients with RD symptoms lasting more than 3\u2009months were excluded. \n\nFifty\u2010five age\u2010, gender\u2010 and education\u2010matched volunteers were recruited. They had no history of vertigo, nor did they have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Volunteers with neurological, mental, or systemic disorders were excluded. They received resting\u2010state fMRI scanning and demographic information was gathered. To rule out the effects of cognitive impairment on the brain function of the subjects, all subjects were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); participants with scores of MoCA\u2009<\u200926 were excluded. Assessments of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD were conducted by a qualified neuropsychologist who was blinded to the outcome data. Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (\u30102020\u3011021801) and all subjects provided written informed consent forms before entering the study. \n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nAll Participants received high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional T1\u2010weighted (3D\u2010T1) anatomical imaging and resting\u2010state fMRI using a 3.0T GE MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems) at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Subjects were required to rest with their eyes closed and lie still during the scanning. The 3D\u2010T1 images were acquired with 1\u2009mm isotropic voxels using a BRAVO sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009ms, flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 156 slices. We adopted a fast\u2010field echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI) sequence to acquire the whole brain fMRI images (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, thickness\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, 210 volumes, total scan time\u2009=\u20097\u2009min). \n\n\n### Image data preprocessing \n  \nTo reduce the influence of initial unstable blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signal, the first 10 functional time points were removed; the left 200 time points were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 software (SPM12,  ) and CONN toolbox (Whitfeld\u2010Gabrieli S, 2012; Version 18b;  ) working on MATLAB R2016a (MathWorks, Inc.). The preprocessing steps were the default parameters within the CONN toolbox, including (a) functional slice\u2010timing correction, (b) functional realignment, (c) functional outlier detection (a subject head motion threshold set at 3\u2009mm and a global signal threshold set at z\u2009=\u20099), (d) structural center to (0, 0, 0) coordinates (translation), (e) functional segmentation and normalization (DARTEL), and (f) spatial smoothing based on a Gaussian kernel of 6\u2010mm full\u2010width at half maximum. Four patients in RD group, five patients in non\u2010RD group, and two healthy subjects were excluded due to large head motion or poor normalization. Totally, 51 patients with RD, 50 patients without RD, and 53 healthy subjects were included in the following analysis. \n\n\n### Seed\u2010based functional connectivity \n  \nAfter preprocessing, filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) was adopted to eliminate the influences of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. Cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and global mean signals, as well as the 24 motion realignment parameters were regressed out. We performed a seed\u2010to\u2010voxel method using two seeds (the bilateral OP2) related to key vestibular cortex of the brain. We extracted the two seeds from the Juelich histological atlas available on the FMRIB Software Library ( ). Then, the mean time\u2010courses of the two seeds were extracted and the Pearson's correlation coefficients (  r  ) between the extracted time\u2010courses and all other time\u2010courses of the entire brain voxels were calculated. Finally,   r   was converted to z scores using Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformation. It is now still complex and controversial whether to remove the global mean signal. Therefore, we also performed an analysis without using global signal regression (GSR) and the results are demonstrated in Tables\u00a0  and   and Figures\u00a0 \u2013 . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Analysis of demography and clinical characteristics \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, v22.0) for Windows (SPSS Institute Inc.). All data of continuous variables were tested for normality. Group comparisons of demographic information among the three groups were performed using chi\u2010square tests for categorical variables (gender) and one\u2010way analysis of covariance (ANOVA) for parametric continuous variables (age, years of education, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD). For BPPV patients with and without RD, the two\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests were used for parametric continuous variables (scores of VVAS and DHI, and duration of vertigo before successful CRM) and chi\u2010square tests were used for categorical variables (affected side and affected semicircular canal). \n\n\n#### Analysis of differences in FC \n  \nGroup differences in FC among the three groups were tested using a voxel\u2010wise one\u2010way ANOVA, with age, gender, years of education, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD as covariates. To show the inter\u2010group differences, we performed post\u2010hoc two\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests between every two of the three groups, controlling for demographic and clinical features severally. The post\u2010hoc inter\u2010group comparisons were performed within the mask which showed FC differences from the ANOVA analysis. Multiple comparisons were corrected by a false discovery rate (FDR) method (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n#### Correlation analysis \n  \nFor FC showing significant between\u2010group differences, we performed Pearson's partial correlation analysis between altered FC and clinical characteristics (duration of vertigo, scores of VVAS and DHI before successful CRM, and duration of RD, scores of DVAS and DHI after successful CRM) in BPPV patients with RD, controlling for age, gender, educational years, MoCA, HAMA, HAMD, affected side, and affected semicircular canal. The significance level was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups were summarized in Table\u00a0 . As we could see, there was no statistical difference among the three groups in age, gender, education level, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD (all   p\u2009>  \u20090.05). In addition, no significant difference was observed between BPPV patients with and without RD in affected side, affected semicircular canal, and VVAS scores before successful CRP (all   p  \u2009>\u20090.05). However, BPPV patients with RD showed longer duration of BPPV (  p  \u2009=\u20090.002) and higher DHI scores (  p  \u2009=\u20090.005) before successful CRP in comparison with BPPV patients without RD. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects. \n    \n\n###  FC   differences across groups \n  \nWhen the left OP2 was selected as a seed, the three groups showed significant FC differences in the left angular gyrus (AG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), parahippocampa gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), as well as the bilateral thalamus, precuneus, and cerebellar regions (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 ). When the right OP2 was chosen as a seed, one\u2010way ANOVA revealed no obvious difference among the three groups in FC. The post\u2010hoc results demonstrated that BPPV patients with RD exhibited decreased FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left AG, thalamus, precuneus, MFG, and the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) in comparison with healthy subjects (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ); Beyond that, compared with BPPV patients without RD, patients with RD showed decreased FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left MFG, AG, MTG, and the right CPL (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nBrain regions showing significant FC differences among the three groups when the left OP2 was selected as a seed (one\u2010way ANOVA,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FDR corrected)).

The difference in results without GSR was that the left OP2 showed decreased FC with left fusiform gyrus in BPPV patients with RD compared with healthy controls, and the left OP2 displayed decreased FC with right superior parietal lobule and left inferior parietal lobule in BPPV patients with RD compared with patients without RD (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Tables\u00a0  and   and Figures\u00a0  and  ). \n\n\n### Associations between   FC   and clinical characteristics in   BPPV   patients with   RD  \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , in BPPV patients with RD, the FC (z\u2010value) between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of RD symptoms (  p  \u2009=\u20090.025,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.313), and the FC (  z  \u2010value) between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of BPPV (  p  \u2009=\u20090.011,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.352). \n  \n(A) Functional connectivity (FC) between the left thalamus and the left parietal operculum cortex 2 (OP2) was negatively correlated with the duration of residual dizziness (RD) (  p  \u2009=\u20090.025,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.313); (B) FC between the left angular gyrus (AG) and the left OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with RD (  p  \u2009=\u20090.011,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.352). \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study is the first one which investigated resting\u2010state FC changes focusing on OP2 in BPPV patients with RD after successful treatment. The results showed altered FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left AG, MFG, thalamus, precuneus, MTG, and the right CPL in BPPV patients with RD compared to BPPV patients without RD and healthy volunteers. \n\nCompared with patients without RD and healthy subjects, patients with RD exhibited decreased FC between left OP2 and left AG. The AG is located in a posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule corresponding to Brodmann Area (BA) 39.  A functional neuroimaging study suggested that the bilateral AG were significantly activated during task of spatial navigation.  It was also reported that there existed structural plasticity in the AG when subjects were learning new skills that tap on spatial coordination.  Thus, it is believed that the AG is involved in spatial cognition, which reflects our ability to process and integrate all spatial aspects of our environment, including the spatial analysis of external sensory information and internal mental representations.  The functional changes in the left AG have been previously observed in patients with chronic unilateral vestibulopathy during rest and in patients with PPPD during stationary emotional stimulation. ,   Our study found altered function in AG in BPPV patients with RD, which was consistent with a previous resting\u2010state fMRI study which reported decreased ALFF in the AG in BPPV patients with RD compared to patients without RD.  We also found that the FC between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of BPPV. Our results indicated impaired spatial cognition in BPPV patients with RD, and the occurrence of RD might be related to the reduced FC between the areas involved in central vestibular processing and spatial cognition. \n\nWe also found decreased FC between the left OP2 and right CPL\/Crus2 in BPPV patients with RD compared to patients without RD and healthy controls. Central vestibular pathway involves the cerebellum, as the projections from the vestibular nuclei extend to the cerebellum.  The cerebellum is an important area playing a vital role in maintaining balance and coordination of the goal\u2010oriented movements.  The cerebellum is closely associated with dizziness and vertigo; stroke with lesions within the cerebellum is one of the most common causes of vascular vertigo.  As part of the cerebellum, the CPL\/Crus2 was reported to be closely related to spatial cognition, playing an important role in spatial navigation and orientation. ,   The altered function in CPL\/Crus2 found in our study was in keeping with the abnormal gray matter volume (GMV) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in CPL\/Crus2 in patients with BPPV in a previous neuroimaging study.  Thus, we suspected that the decreased FC between left OP2 and right CPL\/Crus2 might also indicate reduced connectivity between the regions engaged in vestibular processing and spatial cognition. \n\nThe MFG was previously thought to be involved in vestibular processing and was reported to be a part of vestibular network, as it was obviously activated during tasks of vestibular or caloric stimulation. ,   The MFG receives vestibular information from vestibular nuclei and is believed to be the origin of direct white matter fibers to the vestibular nuclei.  Functional changes in MFG have been reported in previous vestibular disorders, including VM, PPPD, visually induced dizziness (VID), and mal de debarquement syndrome. ,  ,  ,  ,   In BPPV patients with RD, we found decreased FC between left OP2 and left MFG when comparing to BPPV patients without RD and healthy controls. The decreased FC between OP2 and MFG in our study might suggest decreased connectivity within the central vestibular network. \n\nBased on previous neuroimaging studies and lesion studies, the thalamus plays an important role in central vestibular processing as well, it receives vestibular input from the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, and conveys vestibular information to the central vestibular cortex. ,  ,  ,   In this study, we found decreased FC between left OP2 and left thalamus in BPPV patients with RD, indicating decreased thalamo\u2010OP2 vestibular pathway. In addition, we observed that the FC between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of RD. As all fMRI data were collected at the early stage of RD symptoms (within 1\u2009week), we believed that the decreased FC between left thalamus and OP2 potentially predict the development and the duration of residual dizziness in patients with BPPV. \n\nThe precuneus is a core region of default mode network (DMN) and plays a crucial role in attention monitoring and self\u2010centered cognition.  It was demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the precuneus evoked symptom of vertigo, suggesting that the precuneus was an important brain region in processing vestibular information. ,   In the present study, we observed decreased FC between left OP2 and left precuneus in BPPV patients with RD compared to healthy controls; this result was in agreement with a previous resting\u2010state fMRI study which reported decreased ALFF in the bilateral precuneus in BPPV patients with RD.  Our results of decreased FC between left OP2 and left precuneus in BPPV patients with RD might indicate decreased connectivity within the vestibular network. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations in some aspects. First, the sample size of the present study was relatively small and only resting\u2010state fMRI was adopted, a multi\u2010model MRI study with larger sample size should be considered in the following study. Second, we only adopted a seed\u2010based FC method, which could not overcome the defect of forcibly segmenting the brain atlas. Subsequent studies should combine seed\u2010based FC with other methods, for example, independent component analysis (ICA)\u2010based FC or functional network connectivity (FNC), dynamic FC or FNC, graph theory analysis, etc. Last but not the least, the results of seeds\u2010based FC with and without global signal regression was not entirely consistent. This might have some influence on the conclusion of this study. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn summary, the current study found that BPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition. These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition. In addition, the reduced FC could potentially become an imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of RD in patients with BPPV, which should be further verified by machine learning (ML) methods with more subjects in the future. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nZhengwei Chen and Yueji Liu designed the study, analyzed the data, and wrote the main manuscript; Cunxin Lin, Dan Liu, and Lijie Xiao collected the data; Haiyan Liu and Xiu\u2010e Wei organized the data; Liangqun Rong revised the manuscript.

In the context of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), unawareness may develop in predementia stages and contributes to disease severity and progression. Here, we use in-vivo multi-modal neuroimaging to profile the brain phenotype of individuals presenting altered self-awareness of memory during aging. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nAmyloid- and tau-PET (  N  \u2009=\u2009335) and resting-state functional MRI (  N  \u2009=\u2009713) imaging data of individuals from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (A4)\/Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) Study were used in this research. We applied whole-brain voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses to characterize the cortical intersections of tau, amyloid, and functional connectivity networks underlying unawareness in the aging brain compared to aware, complainer and control groups. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIndividuals with unawareness present elevated amyloid and tau burden in midline core regions of the default mode network compared to aware, complainer or control individuals. Unawareness is characterized by an altered network connectivity pattern featuring hyperconnectivity in the medial anterior prefrontal cortex and posterior occipito-parietal regions co-locating with amyloid and tau deposition. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nUnawareness is an early behavioral biomarker of AD pathology. Failure of the self-referential system in unawareness of memory decline can be linked to amyloid and tau burden, along with functional network connectivity disruptions, in several medial frontal and parieto-occipital areas of the human brain. \n\n   Plain language summary  \nLack of self-awareness of cognitive changes, such as memory decline, occurs in people who later go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In the present study, we investigated various characteristics of the brains of people who were unaware they were experiencing memory loss and likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to their age. We identified individuals with low performance in memory tests and a lack of sense of their memory decline. Compared to aware individuals, they had more deposits of proteins known to be present at higher levels in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The results of this investigation suggest that unawareness of memory decline is an early behavioral sign that a person might develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This knowledge might enable such people to be more easily identified in the future, and treatments to be started sooner. \n  \nBueichek\u00fa et al. use multimodal in vivo neuroimaging to investigate the brain characteristics of individuals presenting unawareness of memory loss who are at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to age. They find unawareness of memory decline is an early behavioral sign that a person might develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnawareness of memory loss , is the inability to recognize memory impairments and the incapacity of updating and integrating novel information, producing a mismatch between the acquired knowledge and stored autobiographical experiences and the ongoing perceptual inputs, namely a petrified self\u2009 . In this work, we investigate the brain phenotype of individuals presenting lower self-awareness of subtle memory decline and refer to this phenomenon as unawareness. In the context of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), unawareness of memory loss is a common symptom with a prevalence estimated to range between 20-80% . It appears in pre-clinical to prodromal stages and is considered independent from primary cognitive deficits (i.e., attention, memory, executive functioning) . It has been related to the deterioration of metacognition or self-monitoring  and contributes to disease severity, symptomatology worsening, such as disinhibition and dangerous behavior (as unaware individuals are not aware of their limitations), aggravating mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and, in late stages, to loss of self-identity. Unawareness of cognitive deficits increases caregiver burden  and earlier institutionalization. Previous research has demonstrated that the phenomenon is associated with a higher level of AD neuropathology, and it is also a good predictor of clinical progression . In all, unawareness is clinically relevant as an indicator of a patient\u2019s reliability to report self-dysfunction . At the research level, it could be considered a behavioral marker of AD pathology presence in cognitively normal individuals and individuals showing subtle cognitive decline. \n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging research has linked greater AD-related changes to lower awareness of memory performance in specific AD-affected brain structures. That is, in studies using fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET), decreased metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex has been consistently related to unawareness . Lower awareness has been linked to increased global amyloid  and more tau in medial temporal lobe (MTL) . Interestingly, postmortem studies indicate unawareness in elderly adults, with or without dementia, is solely linked to one of the pathological events associated with AD: the presence of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) . Structural and functional neuroimaging has linked unawareness to several cortical systems in the human brain . Previous studies have described brain atrophy in MTL structures, lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and fusiform gyrus in unaware subjects . At the functional level, it features dysfunction of the frontal lobe or midline temporal cortex structures  and disconnection within the subsystems of the default mode network (DMN) and between this network and MTL structures . Consistent with AD pathology, unawareness in early stages is associated with a functional decline of midline structures and, in later stages, with parietotemporal and frontotemporal systems failures . AD-related amyloid and tau pathology initially affect topographically distinct circuits, with tau first damaging brain stem nuclei and medial temporal cortex. In contrast, amyloid spreads initially in midline areas of the neocortex. Due to this distinct initial pattern of accumulation, some authors suggest that early pathology is independent, while in later disease stages, it is thought that amyloid drives tau pathology in arresting neocortical regions. In parallel, it has been observed that in preclinical stages, tau burden closely tracks memory changes and predicts future cognitive decline. In unawareness, it remains unknown whether single factors -such as tau aggregation- or multiple AD-related pathological players \u2013 like the co-occurrence of amyloid deposition and tau aggregation \u2013 coordinate together in vivo to produce the emergence of unawareness in the preclinical stages of AD. \n\nThe aim of the present research is to describe from a multi-modal neuroimaging analytical approach the brain phenotype underlying unawareness in the aging brain. We hypothesize that adults who present unawareness show a distinct pattern of amyloid and tau deposition, prospective pathology spreading, and specific functional disconnectomic profiles when compared to adults who are aware of subtle memory decline and to control participants. In this research, we observe that unawareness of memory decline in older individuals is marked by elevated amyloid and tau burden in midline core regions of the default mode network, coupled with functional network hyperconnectivity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nImaging data of 1725 participants from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies was retrieved . The A4 study is a three-year, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in 1000 older individuals with evidence of amyloid accumulation on screening PET scans, that test will whether anti-amyloid treatment can slow the rate of cognitive decline on a composite measure of sensitive neuropsychological tests  [ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02008357]. The LEARN cohort comprises participants from the observational arm of the A4 study . The main outcomes of the A4 study have been published in . We only use baseline imaging and behavioral data from the A4\/LEARN studies in the present study. Participants were distributed into two groups: i) an amyloid- and tau-PET sample: consisting of 447 participants, with final sample   N  \u2009=\u2009335 (Table\u00a0 ); ii) an fMRI sample: with a total of 1278 participants, with a final sample   N  \u2009=\u2009713 (Table\u00a0 ) (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). Participants from the PET sample and the fMRI sample are independent (i.e., samples are not mixed throughout the analysis). Functional MRI data from the PET sample has not been used in the current study to avoid circularity. A4\/LEARN participants underwent a series of screening visits to determine their eligibility  (screening visit 1: collection of demographic information, apolipoprotein E genotyping, cognitive testing, and clinical assessments to determine eligibility to proceed to screening visit 2; screening visit 2: amyloid-PET imaging). One of the eligibility criterions is the amyloid status, which is determined using Florbetapir amyloid imaging. According to amyloid status, A4\/LEARN participants are sub-classified into two groups: amyloid elevated participants (in our PET sample: 214 individuals; in our fMRI sample: 352 individuals), or not elevated amyloid participants (in our PET sample: 43 individuals; in our fMRI sample: 234 individuals). In our PET and fMRI sample 78 and 127 individuals are not assigned to either group respectively. In the present work the amyloid status classification was not used throughout the analysis because we used a continuous variable strategy. Screening included demographic, family history, lifestyle questionnaires, cognitive testing, functional questionnaires, and medical screening. Participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of zero, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 25 to 30, and Logical Memory delayed recall (LM)  score of 6 to18 were eligible to proceed to imaging procedures. As reported in  participants with high LM scores (>1.5 standard deviations (SD) above norms in this age range) were excluded from the study. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was secured at the participating sites. All A4 and LEARN participants provided informed consent prior to any research step in compliance with local IRB and provided permission to share their de-identified data to advance the quest to find a successful treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because the current study reuses data from the A4 study, we did not seek specific IRB approval for our study.   \nDemographics of the PET sample \n  \n N  \u2009=\u2009335 individuals. Legend: *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.005, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n    \nDemographics of the fMRI sample \n  \n N  \u2009=\u2009713 individuals. Legend: *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.005, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n  \n\n\n### Experimental group definition \n  \nFour subgroups were defined to investigate the brain phenotypic characteristic of adults with lower self-awareness (aware, unaware, subjective complainer, and control groups; Fig.\u00a0 ). Classification of participants into groups was based on objective and subjective memory assessments. We used neuropsychological tests to assess participants\u2019 performance on memory system and to evaluate objective memory decline: the free and cued selective reminding (FCSRT) test  and the LM test. A participant was classified as having memory decline when performance in both tests was below population norms. The delayed score from the LM assesses episodic memory and is used in combination with years of education to determine memory impairments (a score equal to or less than 8 for 16 years of education, a score of 4 for 8 to 15 years of education, and a score of 2 for 0 to 7 years of education). FCSRT offers a controlled learning setting to a reliable metric that englobes episodic memory encoding, recording, and retrieving processes. A score equal to or inferior to 24 in free recall and 44 in total recall in FCSRT indicates objective memory problems. For assessing subjective memory performance, the Memory Assessment Clinic Questionnaire (MACQ)  was used. The MACQ is a brief self-reported questionnaire composed by 5 questions, like: recalling where you have put objects (such as keys) in your home or office, or remembering specific facts from a newspaper or magazine article you have just finished reading. Participants must reply to these questions in relation to when they were in high school or college (specific instruction: as compared to when you were in high school or college, how would you describe your ability to perform the following tasks involving your memory). The questionnaire includes a final and more general question: in general, how would you describe your memory as compared to when you were in high school. For all 6 questions, it uses a Likert-rating scale (i.e., much better now, somewhat better now, about the same, somewhat poorer now, much poorer now). The MACQ generates a score (range 7-35) that quantifies degree of memory complaint. Overall, this questionnaire targets age-related changes in that the subject is asked to rate current abilities compared to past abilities . A participant is considered to have subjective memory complaints when the score is equal to or superior to 25 . Subsequently, the aware group is characterized by having both memory complaints and objective memory impairments. The individuals in the unaware group have objective memory loss, but these participants do not demonstrate subjective memory complains. Contrary to the unaware group, the complainer group shows subjective memory complaints but does not have objective memory impairments. Finally, the control group does not have subjective or objective memory problems. In this study, we focus on investigating the neurobehavioral characteristics of the unaware group, compared to the aware, the complainer, and the control group, which cover the spectrum of possible aging profiles.

For age, years of education, and MMSE, a non-parametric approach with a Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 test was used to evaluate group differences. For assessing between-groups differences in MACQ and LM delayed score, as the data distribution did not follow a normal curve, we conducted a Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 test followed by a post-hoc Dunn\u2019s test, with a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison correction in both statistical tests. We conducted a one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test for free and cued FCSRT analyses. Dunnett\u2019s test for planned group comparisons was also used for FCSRT tests. We used the R package for all statistical analyses ( ) . \n\n\n### PET, MRI, and fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nA4 is a multicenter imaging study acquiring data across North America. Detailed acquisition information should be found in A4 website within the IDA repository ( ). The following acquisition parameters were described in the study protocols or recovered from the NiFTI images. \n\n#### PET acquisition \n  \nAmyloid PET imaging was collected 50 to 70\u2009minutes post-injection (18-florbetapir [18F] FBP-PET). Amyloid images were reconstructed in 4 \u00d7 5\u2009minute frames, with the exception of some sites that reconstructed the data in 50 to 70\u2009minutes data, in a single frame. Tau PET imaging was collected 80 to 110\u2009minutes post-injection ([18\u2009F] FTP-PET). Tau images were reconstructed in 6\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009minute frames with the exception of some sites that reconstructed the data in 80 to 110\u2009minutes data, in a single frame. \n\n\n#### Structural and functional MRI acquisitions \n  \n MRI scanners used in the A4 study are General Electrics, Siemens, Phillips Medical Systems or Philips Healthcare. High resolution 1\u2009mm isotropic 3D T1-weighted structural images and resting state functional MRI were used in this study. Resting state functional MRI was used to measure changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) T2* signal while the participants remained still with their eyes open. Gradient echo or gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences with the following parameters were acquired: 3000\u2009ms TR; 30\u2009ms TE; 80- or 90-degrees flip angle; 3\u2009mm isotropic voxels. \n\n\n#### Positron emission tomography preprocessing \n  \n FMRIB Software Library v6.0.4 (FSL;  ) and FreeSurfer v6 ( ) were used for PET preprocessing performing the following steps: FreeSurfer preprocessing of the structural image, co-registration and average of PET frames, rigid body transformation between PET and structural MRI image, computation of standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr), partial volume correction (using FreeSurfer three-compartment model - M\u00fcller-G\u00e4rtner (MG) method), transformation to standard MNI152 space and spatial smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 8\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). The inferior cerebellum was used as the reference region for tau SUVr  the whole cerebellum for amyloid-\u03b2 , as this have shown to obtain the best results to study AD. A quality check of the preprocessed data was be performed to check the correct preprocessing and the presence of head motion. The initial sample had   N  \u2009=\u2009447 participants. The final sample consisted of   N  \u2009=\u2009335 participants. We excluded 55 participants due to missing fMRI scanning parameters or belonging to an under-represented scanning facility; 39 participants had missing behavioral data, and 1 participant did not meet image quality after quality inspection). \n\n\n#### Magnetic resonance imaging structural and functional preprocessing \n  \nThe preprocessing procedures were adapted from Diez et al.  . FMRIB Software Library v6.0.4 (FSL) and MATLAB 2021b were used for these analyses. The anatomical T1-weighted MRI preprocessing pipeline included: re-orientation to right-posterior-inferior (RPI); alignment to anterior and posterior commissures; skull stripping; gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and computation of non-linear transformation between individual skull-stripped T1 and 3\u2009mm resolution MNI152 template images. The functional MRI preprocessing pipeline included: slice time correction; re-orientation to RPI; re-aligning functional volumes with a rigid body transformations (6 parameters linear transformation); computation of the transformation between individual skull-stripped T1 and mean functional images; intensity normalization; removal of confounding factors from the data using linear regression - including 12 motion-related covariates (rigid motion parameters and its derivatives), linear and quadratic terms, and five components each from the lateral ventricles and white matter. Functional images were normalized with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 8-mm FWHM. Band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise was applied. Head motion was quantified using realignment parameters obtained during image preprocessing, which included 3 translation and 3 rotation estimates. Scrubbing of time points with excess head motion interpolated all time points with a frame displacement > 0.5\u2009mm . We used 170 time points (8\u2009minutes and 30\u2009seconds) not exceeding the displacement threshold in all the individuals to generate the connectivity matrices. The distributions of the correlations across time series were inspected for possible noise contamination. The initial sample had   N  \u2009=\u20091278 participants. The final sample consisted of   n  \u2009=\u2009713 participants. We excluded 480 participants due to missing scanning parameters, 11 participants who did not meet T1 image quality after visual inspection, and 74 participants who did not meet functional image quality after inspection). We used the Combat harmonization algorithm to reduce the inter-scanner variability (i.e., changes in field strength, gradient nonlinearity, subject positioning, and longitudinal drift, etc.) in fMRI analyses . We applied harmonization to fMRI-seed and degree centrality maps before statistical analyses. \n\n\n\n### Characterizing brain imaging phenotype of unawareness \n  \n#### Distinct pattern of AD pathology in unawareness \n  \nWe conducted an analysis of variance (ANCOVA) for each imaging modality. All analyses were done at the whole-brain voxel-wise level (for an overview of the imaging analysis, see Fig.\u00a0 ). We compared each subgroup against the rest, making the following comparisons: (i) aware group > control group; (ii) unaware group > control group; iii) complainer group > control group; (iv) unaware group > aware group; (v) aware group > complainer group, and (vi) unaware group > complainer group). The methods used also allowed to investigate the possible results of the reverse contrasts. Analysis included age, sex, years of education and MMSE as control covariates. MMSE was included as a covariate to control for cognition and isolate the awareness effect. \n\n\n#### Possible tau spreading, amyloid progression, and functional network vulnerability \n  \nSubsequent analyses consisted in studying tau and amyloid connectivity-based spreading from the vulnerable regions found in the omnibus analysis and in finding a characterizing pattern of network organization linked to unawareness (tau spreading: Fig.\u00a0 c and  ). PET-connectivity is based on the estimation of covariation in measures (amyloid or tau) across subjects ; in this sense, connectivity is measuring the relationship of increased presence of amyloid or tau between different brain regions. We used Matlab to delimit five regions of interest (ROIs) for tau-PET and two for amyloid-PET. The ROIs corresponded to peak maxima deposition in the clusters resulting from the unaware>aware comparison for each modality (we used the results that were corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-wise Monte Carlo simulation method; please see below in   Multiple comparisons corrections in imaging analysis  ). The ROIs size was 1mm , using the automatic anatomical atlas ( ). Thus, for tau-PET connectivity, we defined the following ROIs:   i  ) precuneus,   ii  ) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),   iii  ) fusiform gyrus,   iv  ) lateral occipital cortex,   v  ) lingual gyrus (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). For amyloid-PET connectivity, we delimited two ROIs:   i  ) medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),   ii  ) medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). For investigating possible routes of tau spreading or the amyloid progression, we conducted ROI to whole-brain regression analysis to find the propagation pathways from the vulnerable brain regions. Second, we performed whole-brain voxel-wise FC MRI analysis from the previous-step resulting maps, which were corrected for multiple comparisons. In both analyses, we used the control group data to describe the most probable routes of propagation and connectivity projections. The rationale for using the control group data is that this group represents an unimpaired population, and that this data was independent - from the contrast image   unaware>aware   - from where the ROIs were derived. Additionally, this approach inspects the similarity between imaging modalities and the correspondence between metabolic amyloid- or tau-propagation and functional network vulnerability. Finally, for the ROIs producing statistically significant results, we did a region-wise analysis with the aware and unaware group data in the fMRI sample. Then, we performed planned comparisons in FC differences linked to unawareness: (i) unaware group > aware group; (ii) unaware > control group. These analyses aimed to detect altered functional connectivity (FC) networks in the unaware group compared to control and aware participants. \n\n\n#### Degree centrality analysis \n  \nWeighted degree (WD) analysis on rs-fcMRI data was done to identify hyper-connected patterns and between-groups spatiotemporal differences in the awareness network organization. We calculated a voxel-wise FC adjacency matrix for each participant. Only voxels corresponding to gray matter tissue were used. We obtained connectivity matrices by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between the time course of each pair voxels. Only the positive correlations were retained to eliminate deleterious associations between voxels due to the ambiguity of negative correlations . The WD of each voxel was computed by summing the weights of all its connections. Individual WD maps were used for between-group comparisons. Using a General Linear Model analysis, we obtained the brain map of the unaware > aware group. Subsequently, to investigate the patterns of co-location between elevated tau or amyloid and WD, we calculated the z-scores of the unaware vs. aware comparison of each map (tau, amyloid, or WD). Finally, z-score maps were projected jointly to create an overlap of two maps: i) tau and WD; ii) amyloid and WD. \n\n\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility \n  \nFor behavioral analysis, we used Cramer-von Mises normality tests to assess sample distributions. We employed Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 tests with post-hoc Dunn\u2019s test for non-normally distributed variables and ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey\u2019s and Dunnett\u2019s tests for normally distributed variables to evaluate group differences. To estimate effect sizes, we used epsilon-squared and eta-squared. Sample sizes can be found in text, figures, and table captions. The group differences analyses used the Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni methods for multiple comparisons correction. All imaging analysis results (from amyloid-PET, tau-PET, rs-fcMRI, and weighted degree rs-fcMRI images) were also corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-wise Monte Carlo simulation method, with 10,000 iterations to estimate the probability of false-positive clusters with a two-tailed   p  -value\u2009<\u20090.05 (3dClustSim; AFNI:  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Unawareness neurocognitive profile \n  \nIn omnibus tests, we found between-group differences in age, years of education and MMSE (a trend in the PET sample in MMSE). Also, the overall statistical models show group differences in objective and subjective memory measurements in both samples (see Table\u00a0  for the PET sample and Table\u00a0  for the fMRI sample). Concerning the memory scores, in both samples, we found that the aware and unaware groups perform worse than the control group in neuropsychological memory tests. These results confirm the presence of objective memory decline in the aware and unaware groups, while the complainer group did not differ from the control group, indicating unimpaired memory performance. In relation to subjective memory complaints, we found, in both samples, that the unaware group did not differ from the control group but was significantly different compared to the aware group, which confirms the lack of awareness of memory decline in the unaware group. Note that differences in MACQ in the aware group, compared to the control group, mean that the former participants recognize their memory decline. In contrast, the controls did not have any memory impairment to admit. Even though it is not the object of this study, we found that the complainer group had similar results in objective memory tests when compared to controls (i.e., memory is not impaired) and equivalent results in MACQ when compared to the aware group (i.e., the complainer group believe they have objective memory loss despite performing within normal range on these tests). All post-hoc between-group comparisons analyses results have been reported in Table\u00a0  for the PET sample and Table\u00a0  for the fMRI sample. Additional Dunnett\u2019s test analysis results confirm the post-hoc test for FCSRT score are reported in Supplementary Table\u00a0 .   \nPost-hoc analyses results for the PET sample (  N  \u2009=\u2009335 individuals) after omnibus between-group comparisons, investigating the differences in objective or subjective memory scores \n  \nLegend: *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.005, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n    \nPost-hoc analyses results for the fMRI sample (  N  \u2009=\u2009713 individuals) after omnibus between-group comparisons, investigating the differences in objective or subjective memory scores \n  \nLegend: *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.005, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n  \n\n\n### Distinct pattern of AD pathology in unawareness \n  \nThe analyses aimed to find distinctive patterns of amyloid and tau deposition linked to unawareness, compared to being aware of one\u2019s memory decline, subjective memory complaints, or to controls (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found that the unaware group had increased amyloid deposition when compared to the aware, complainer and the control groups (  p  -value\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons; Fig.\u00a0 ). The reverse contrasts did not produce significant results. That is, we found statistically significant differences between the participants with unawareness and aware participants which were located in areas that resemble the DMN. Specifically, the unaware participants had increased amyloid burden in the medial anterior prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal regions, including inferior lateral and medial parietal areas, with visible differences in the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus. The orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortex were also prominent when comparing the unaware group to the complainer group, as well as the lateral and medial inferior temporal gyrus towards the medial occipital cortex, including the fusiform and the lingual gyri and the calcarine sulcus. The lateral and medial occipito-temporal brain regions showed the most prominent differences when comparing the unaware group to the control group. In relation to tau, the unaware group also had increased tau deposition when compared to the rest of the groups separately (  p  -value\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons; Fig.\u00a0 ). The reverse contrasts did not produce significant results. Compared to the aware group, participants with unawareness had significantly increased tau deposition in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and lateral occipital gyrus. Compared to the control participants or complainer participants, this increased tau burden in posterior DMN areas and medial visual cortex was more noticeable, but anterior to posterior MTL showed higher tau deposits. Interestingly, the aware participants displayed more tau depositions than the control and the complainer groups separately but had no differences in regard to amyloid burden (  p  -value\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Moreover, the pattern of tau depositions in the aware group shows brain pathology located in anterior brain regions (e.g., lateral PFC and anterior medial PFC, including anterior cingulate gyrus), while the unaware group showed more predominance for posterior cortical tau burden.

R: Right hemisphere. \n  \n\n\n### Possible tau spreading, amyloid progression, and functional networks vulnerability in unawareness \n  \nAfter studying the general organization pattern of AD pathology, we centered our investigations on possible spreading trajectories of tau and amyloid deposits from vulnerable regions of the unaware phenotype (unaware > aware PET comparison) to characterize the network organization linked to unawareness. First, we used the connectivity data from the control group data to establish imaging templates of potential pathology spreading pathways in the cortical mantle using the max peaks of the unaware > aware PET changes. The controls group offers a scenario of an unbiased brain in which to make predictions of functional connectivity-based pathology progression. In the case of amyloid (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), only the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) showed significant pathways comparing unaware > aware. These connections extend through the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex, also, anterior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In relation to functional network pathways, we found hyperconnectivity in midline areas, locally at mOFC, and in spatially distributed areas such as inferior temporal and occipital cortices (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). In relation to tau propagation pathways from key ROIs of the unaware > aware phenotype showed significant connectivity toward cortical distributed areas, heavily represented by DMN regions, as well as connectivity in the lateral and medial occipito-parietal cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). In relation to functional network pathways (Fig.\u00a0 ), we found midline local and distributed areas at risk of connectivity disturbance. Specifically, we found hyperconnectivity in the posterior cingulate and anterior prefrontal cortex when investigating the connectivity of PCC and precuneus. As seen with probable tau spreading, this network distribution is closely related to the DMN midline structures. On the other hand, visual ROIs indicated hypoconnectivity in medial visual areas, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and medial precentral and postcentral gyrus, and lateral precentral gyrus extending to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.    Tau spreading pathways in unawareness.  \n a   Probable tau spreading from brain regions that have increased tau deposition in unawareness.   b   Functional connectivity describes the brain networks vulnerable to unawareness. We used the imaging data of the control group of the PET sample (  n  \u2009=\u200987 individuals) for   3a   and the imaging data of the control group of the fMRI sample (  n  \u2009=\u2009212 individuals) for   3b  . Color bars represent z-scores. The outline border shows the results corrected for multiple comparisons (two-tailed 95% confidence interval). Maps are projected onto lateral and medial sections. R: Right hemisphere. \n  \n\nTo gain insight into the altered functional connectivity organization in unawareness, we conducted seed-based group-level comparisons using the tau-derived ROIs or the amyloid-derived ROIs of the unaware > aware phenotype. In relation to tau, compared to aware participants, unaware participants have increased local connectivity in the precuneus (i.e., increased FC spatially close to the ROI from where the analysis has been initiated). Also, the unaware participants have increased distributed connectivity in, prominently, anterior medial prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and in lateral occipito-temporal areas, MTL, superior and middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and frontal pole \u2013 compared to aware or to control participants (i.e., increased FC spatially far from the ROI) (Figs.\u00a0 a and  ). The same analysis conducted with the amyloid-derived ROI (i.e., mOFC), these analyses yielded no significant differences between unaware and aware participants or unaware and control participants.    Tau-related altered FC organization in unawareness.  \n a   Unaware participants (  n  \u2009=\u200974 individuals) compared to aware participants (  n  \u2009=\u2009129 individuals).   b   Unaware participants (  n  \u2009=\u200974 individuals) compared to control participants (  n  \u2009=\u2009212 individuals). Brain maps show results corrected for multiple comparisons. Color bars represent z-scores, with a minimum critical value or z-score of 1.96 (two-tailed 95% confidence interval). Maps are projected onto lateral and medial sections. R: Right hemisphere. We used the imaging data of the aware and unaware groups of the fMRI sample. \n  \n\nLastly, between-groups comparisons using WD maps shed some light on the connectivity hubs altered by tau or amyloid deposits of the unawareness group. Specifically, comparing the unaware to the aware participants revealed that unawareness leads to an increased number of connections; an hyperconnectivity state in temporal, parietal and occipital cortical regions (Figs.\u00a0  and\u00a0 ). Brain areas with high tau deposits show increased functional connectivity (Fig.\u00a0 ), particularly in posterior cerebral areas such as the inferior medial occipital cortex (lingual gyrus), inferior and superior lateral occipital cortex, inferior temporal gyrus including the fusiform gyrus, temporooccipital region, left supramarginal gyrus and parietal operculum, right angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, lateral superior temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus. Medial anterior prefrontal, lateral prefrontal, and medial parietal regions, with high amyloid deposits also co-located with brain areas showing hyperconnectivity (Fig.\u00a0 ).    Brain systems alterations in unawareness associated with tau pathology.  \nUnaware participants show higher tau deposition and weighted degree when compared to aware participants (  n  \u2009=\u200972 individuals). To associate and discriminate tau and resting-state functional connectivity effects, these results were merged in an overlap projection that revealed prominent posterior tau deposition and posterior-to-anterior increased connections visible in the brain maps. We used the PET imaging data of the aware group (  n  \u2009=\u200972 individuals) and unaware group (  n  \u2009=\u200925 individuals) for the tau deposition comparison and the fMRI data of the aware group (  n  \u2009=\u2009129 individuals) and unaware group (  n  \u2009=\u200974 individuals) for the WD comparison. Brain maps show results corrected for multiple comparisons. Color bars represent z-scores; uncorrected values cover the range from 2% to 98%, while corrected values are within a minimum critical value or z-score of 1.96 (two-tailed 95% confidence interval) and are delimited by black outline borders. Maps are projected onto lateral and medial sections. \n     Brain systems alterations in unawareness associated with amyloid pathology.  \nUnaware participants show higher amyloid accumulation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and, to a lesser extent, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal gyrus. To associate and discriminate amyloid and resting-state functional connectivity effects, these results were merged in an overlap projection that revealed prominent anterior amyloid deposition in coincidence with increased anterior connectivity. In contrast, posterior-lateral changes in connectivity were not associated with elevated amyloid deposition. We used the PET imaging data of the aware group (  n  \u2009=\u200972 individuals) and unaware group (  n  \u2009=\u200925 individuals) for the amyloid deposition comparison and the fMRI data of the aware group (  n  \u2009=\u2009129 individuals) and unaware group (  n  \u2009=\u200974 individuals) for the WD comparison.

Maps are projected onto lateral and medial sections. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, evidence supports that AD pathophysiology and altered connectivity disruptions are present in adults with unawareness. We observed that unawareness states of memory decline associates to specific patterns of brain pathology that are unique compared to awareness and subjective memory complain individuals. We found that unawareness is characterized by increased tau deposits in midline posterior brain regions, visual medial and lateral regions, and increased amyloid deposition in midline anterior DMN. Additionally, we discovered altered network connectivity in local and distributed midline anterior and posterior brain regions, as well as lateral prefrontal and temporo-occipital regions, indicating a multi-systemic yet precise functional decline in these subjects, with a robust predominance for the cortical posterior areas of the human brain. Overall, these results extend previous research  and support that in unawareness the spatial intersection of tau spreading and functional connectivity changes is critical to understand this phenomenon in early preclinical stages, likely preluding AD progression. \n\nAD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and hyperphosphorylated tau . Years before an individual is clinically diagnosed with AD; unawareness has been shown to develop in some individuals and become worse throughout the course of AD . Thus, it may be considered a unique primary symptom . Combining subjective and objective memory assessments, we detected a group of individuals with unawareness of memory decline that, at the brain level, have typical AD pathology, reinforcing that unawareness is an early behavioral indicator of brain pathology. Previous research supports that cortical hyperphosphorylated tau presence usually is co-located in areas that show atrophy and predicts system degeneration; moreover, when tau affects specific cognitive networks, domain-specific cognitive impairments follow after tau appearance . Our results indicate that unaware individuals have more tau burden in posterior DMN, a cognitive system supporting the self-referential system. Therefore, brain pathology is aligned with behavioral failure of updating self-perception . \n\nTheoretical models of awareness and clinical observations of individuals with AD suggest how AD pathology is detrimental to different components of awareness, including anosognosia in AD (i.e., lack of insight of deficit) . In most clinical cases, amyloid and tau are initially found in different brain areas, but both progress through the brain systems following a hierarchal pathway. In our work, unaware participants have elevated amyloid deposits in neocortical regions extending through the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, medial temporal cortex, inferior occipitotemporal areas, and medial occipital areas. Conversely, tau burden was primarily located in the medial and lateral occipital cortex, medial temporal lobe and inferior temporal cortex, and medial parietal regions (precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex). The distribution of amyloid and tau deposits in unaware individuals reminds us of the early stages of sporadic late-onset AD. Amyloid deposits are first observed in the neocortex, progressing to the allocortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus, and finally extending to the pons and cerebellum . After tau has damaged nuclei at the brainstem, it hierarchically progresses through the medial temporal lobe, neocortical regions such as the inferior temporal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, medial posterior brain regions (i.e., cingulate cortex and precuneus), to finally disturb primary and secondary areas . A recent review indicates that brain regions usually associated with anosognosia, awareness related to episodic memory (i.e., autonoetic consciousness) and metacognition, such as the prefrontal cortex (extending from the medial frontal cortex to superior and inferior frontal gyri), medial temporal lobe, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and, insula, are co-localized with regions representing the DMN . The DMN is composed of a core system and two distinct subsystems . The core system, which implicates the posterior medial parietal and anterior medial prefrontal cortex, is engaged when individuals make autobiographical decisions, either present or future self-referred judgments. In our research, unaware individuals had more tau burden in posteromedial and more amyloid deposits in anteromedial brain areas, which is compatible with the self-referential system starting to fail in preclinical AD. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex subsystem tends to be linked to present self-referential judgments, while future decisions engage the MTL subsystem . Subthreshold elevated tau and amyloid deposition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and MTL structures was also visible, implicating other DMN structures. Altogether, this pathology distribution affecting DMN core regions early in the disease supports predictions of disease progression  and is aligned with previous research on the trajectory of unawareness in AD , functional studies  and FDG-PET studies , highlighting its clinical value. Importantly, these findings may have clinical relevance because they are directly associated with the reliability of the patient\u2019s complaints of dysfunction. Specifically, our results question the clinical use of an individual\u2019s reports of subjective cognitive decline, as some high-risk individuals may be missed using this approach. Importantly, unawareness seems to be a direct result of pathological changes affecting the self-referential network system, or as authors have indicated, dysfunction of some aspects of consciousness might be considered a central phenomenological characteristic of AD . Literature review reveals that the specific patterns of deficits related to unawareness and its correspondence to the presence of pathology in cortical brain regions can be heterogeneous across patients . As such, the current findings provide further evidence that individuals unaware of subtle cognitive changes may represent a specific risk group for AD, and unawareness as a clinical trait deserves more neuroimaging research investigating the co-localization patterns between the brain correlates of behavioral changes and pathology distribution. \n\nTheoretical accounts of anosognosia can be linked to some neuropathological changes associated with the brain phenotype of anosognosia in AD. According to the Cognitive Awareness Model (CAM) , individuals with diminished self-awareness experience a failure in the updating processes of the personal database. This failure occurs during the monitorization of the self: the performance inputs need to be compared to the stored information, in the personal database. When the system works properly, the output of this comparison allows for an update of the personal database. If a mismatch between the new and the stored information is detected, the information is released to the metacognitive awareness system to provide consciousness of decision-making. However, loss of self-awareness impacts the proper function of the comparing mechanisms and updating the self. In this account, multiple neurocognitive factors can lead to anosognosia in AD, being mnemonic anosognosia the one related to memory or consolidation of information therefore, impacting the updating processes . In CAM, anosognosia is partly explained by a loss of mnemonic ability in which knowledge about self-ability is limited to outmoded semantic understanding. Individuals with unawareness suffer a loss of information on performance judgment, a loss of recollection of personally experienced events and a trend to rely on remote and abstracted knowledge when judging self-actions. The most critical aspect linking unawareness and AD is precisely the loss of autobiographical memory and semanticization, along with the failure to update self-knowledge. This leads to a non-updated personal database. Thus, the stable representations of personal ability and the individual\u2019s self-concept stay anchored in past experiences. \n\nUnawareness individuals had a pattern of increased network synchronicity co-localized with increased tau deposits in posterior brain regions and increased amyloid deposits in anterior medial cortical areas. Different interpretations have been linked to hyper-connectivity in the aging brain. In the AD spectrum, when individuals show subtle cognitive decline but still do not meet the criteria for dementia, compensatory mechanisms seem to reflect a coping mechanism as pathology starts to accumulate; thus, hyper-connectivity could be reflecting unaffected neurons overexertion to perform at a similar level. Another plausible explanation is network destabilization preventing proper functioning. Either one or the other, changes in brain regions\u2019 synchronicity appear early in AD, along with other pathophysiological hallmarks. Previous research has found that amyloid deposits are usually located within the DMN areas, such as the medial posterior parietal, medial prefrontal, lateral inferior parietal cortices, and the retrosplenial and medial temporal cortices . Mixed patterns of altered FC (hyper- and hypo-connectivity) have been found in individuals with elevated amyloid burden . In some experiments, there is a decreased connectivity in posterior medial areas (i.e., precuneus, PCC), ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and angular gyrus  or medial temporal areas . At the same time, other reports show an increased connectivity between dorsal and anterior medial prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortices in the context of preclinical AD, which might be driven by the different experimental questions (i.e., comparing amyloid positive or negative cognitively unimpaired individuals). Our work found a co-location pattern between hyper-connectivity in the medial orbitofrontal and frontal cortex and elevated amyloid deposition in unaware participants compared to aware. The relationship between cortical hyperphosphorylated tau burden and abnormal patterns of network connectivity has been less explored. Some authors point to an inverse association between tau burden and connectivity in preclinical stages , while others find positive relations . For instance, DMN and salience network hyper-connectivity in amyloid-positive individuals in the early stages of preclinical AD was related to less tau burden in the inferior temporal cortex . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid positivity was characterized by hypo-connectivity between medial and anterior MTL regions, and that increased CSF tau level was associated with hypo-connectivity between the entorhinal, hippocampus, and posterior-medial brain regions . Contrarily, positive associations have been found between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex pair connectivity and tau burden in the medial parietal cortex . In other research , when considering the relationship between amyloid, tau, and FC, two patterns were distinguished: (i) areas displaying high tau deposits were related to more hypo-connectivity in the elder compared to younger adults; (ii) areas displaying high amyloid cortical deposition were associated with hyper-connectivity in elder compared to younger adults; however, local connectivity was more sensible to these two patterns than distributed connectivity. None of these investigations took into consideration awareness of memory decline. Also, different brain analysis outcomes might be due to differences in estimating amyloid and tau, differences in methodologic approaches modeling functional networks, and differences in demographic characteristics and other risk factors (i.e., specific genes, apolipoprotein e4, family history), contributing all of them differently to developing AD . One limitation of assessing unawareness is the variety of instruments available and the score-variability between them. We tried to minimize this effect by integrating three objective memory scores into a self-report questionnaire; however, we acknowledge our method is one of the many possibilities, and we did not include an informant report. In addition, the MACQ questionnaire investigates individuals\u2019 self-perception of cognitive decline by using questions that target early lifetime periods (childhood). This approach could bias individuals\u2019 responses by drawing attention to all age-related complaints. In this regard, complainers could have been classified as control individuals. Another limitation is the lack of longitudinal data to investigate changes over time. Furthermore, our cohort includes only clinically normal participants (defined as CDR\u2009=\u20090 and MMSE\u2009>\u200925, see SI), thus, we could not compare the current participants to MCI or AD participants. \n\nThe present research investigated the brain phenotype of adults at risk for developing AD presenting subtle memory decline and unawareness. These individuals show increased amyloid deposition in anterior medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as increased tau deposits in posterior cortical regions. Additionally, unawareness is characterized by a hyperconnectivity pattern that highly intersect in anterior to posterior regions of the human brain, overlapping core regions of the DMN. Thus, it suggests that unawareness is a multi-faced manifestation mostly originated by tau pathology inducing hyperconnectivity changes in the posterior self-referential core system of the human brain. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10997795,"text_md5":"6ce04057a3f50747bc412eb96fbbfa6c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,137],"journal":[138,155],"publication_year":[157,161],"title":[172,251],"keywords":[265,385],"abstract":[398,3331],"body":[3340,54855]},"batch":3,"pmid":38580832,"doi":"10.1038\/s43856-024-00497-9","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10997795","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10997795"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10997795\">10997795<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10997795  Multi-modal Neuroimaging Phenotyping of Mnemonic Anosognosia in the Aging Brain"}

Lifelong professional musicianship in conjunction with novel brain imaging techniques offers a unique opportunity to examine brain network differences between musicians and matched controls. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nIn this study we aim to investigate how resting-state functional networks (FNs) manifest in lifelong active musicians. We will evaluate the FNs of lifelong musicians and matched healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe derive FNs using the data-driven independent component analysis approach and analyze the functional network connectivity (FNC) between the default mode (DMN), sensory-motor (SMN), visual (VSN), and auditory (AUN) networks. We examine whether the linear regressions between FNC and age are different between the musicians and the control group. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe age trajectory of average FNC across all six pairs of FNs shows significant differences between musicians and controls. Musicians show an increase in average FNC with age while controls show a decrease (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.013). When we evaluated each pair of FN, we note that in musicians FNC values increased with age in DMN\u2013AUN, DMN\u2013VSN, and SMN\u2013VSN and in controls FNC values decreased with age in DMN\u2013AUN, DMN\u2013SMN, AUN\u2013SMN, and SMN\u2013VSN. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis result provides early evidence that lifelong musicianship may contribute to enhanced brain and cognitive reserve. Results of this study are preliminary and need to be replicated with a larger number of participants. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere is a significant body of research devoted to understanding the interaction of high-end cognitive demands on the building of cognitive reserve across the lifespan with effects that span both healthy aging and pathology. These studies often focus on bi-and multi-lingualism with a lesser body focusing on musicianship, and include a variety of structural and functional neuroimaging techniques at the cortical and subcortical levels (Pantev   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Munte   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Coggins   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Bangert   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Bermudez   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Jancke,  ; Oechslin   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Wan and Schlaug,  ; Halwani   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Luk   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Kuhnis   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Abutalebi   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Abutalebi, Guidi   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Pliatsikas   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Weiss and Bidelman,  ; Yuskaitis   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Felton   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Andrews   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). \n\nThe neuroimaging studies of musicians and musicianship is a burgeoning field of inquiry that emerged in the early 2000s (Pantev   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Munte   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Bangert   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Jancke,  ; Elmer and Jancke,  ). Recent work on musicians, especially diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of white matter tracts, has contextualized imaging analysis within the framework of aging and building cognitive reserve (Oechslin   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Halwani   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Andrews   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Although early evidence suggests enhanced generation of neuronal, dendritic, and synaptic connections and functional reorganization of neural networks across modalities, the case that the neural mechanisms of musicianship can lead to enhanced brain and cognitive reserve is not well understood and requires further investigation. \n\nNeuroimaging research focusing on professional musicians can be categorized into the following main topics: (i) the relationship of musicianship and neuroplasticity (Munte   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Jancke,  ), (ii) neuroanatomical correlates of musicianship (Pantev   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Bermudez   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), (iii) enhanced encoding of vowels and speech in professional musicians (Kuhnis   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Weiss and Bidelman,  ), (iv) timbre-specific auditory cortical representations in musicians (Kuhnis   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), (v) shared networks for auditory and motor processing in professional musicians (Bangert   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), and (vi) brainstem recordings of speech sounds in musicians (Weiss and Bidelman,  ). These topics have been investigated using various functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging techniques (MRI). Resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) focusing on musicians began to emerge more recently and have been limited to studies of improvization (Bengtsson   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Ansari,  ; Berkowitz and Ansari,  ; Berkowitz and Ansari,  ; Rosen   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Lopata   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), different types of musical training (Belden   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), and more general musical creativity (Bashwiner   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). These studies apply region of interest (ROI) seed-based analysis approaches. \n\nRaichle's important work on intrinsic brain activity based on resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) have proven to be very significant in increasing the depth of understanding the baseline functional networks (FNs) of the human brain. In rfMRI, participants do not perform an assigned task, but are asked to lie still, stay awake, and relax (Biswal   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Lowe   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Numerous studies have reported that rfMRI data are associated with age, neural response, fluid intelligence, sex, genetics, and many mental disorders (Greicius   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Craddock   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Dosenbach   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Glahn   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Scheinost   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Finn   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Zhang   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Canario   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). In this study, we investigate how FNs of rfMRI are associated with musicianship. Studies have suggested that the baseline FNs of the brain are not constrained by the underlying anatomical white matter connections observed through DTI (Raichle,  ;  ). Underlying mechanism of FNs are complex and includes the spontaneous rfMRI fluctuations and their correlation to each other (He   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; He and Raichle,  ). Raichle's rfMRI studies provide a clear basis set of FNs resulting from the intrinsic fluctuations in brain activity that consist of bilateral, symmetrical, and discrete cortical areas, including the default mode (DMN), the sensorimotor (SMN), auditory (AUN), visual (VSN), executive control (ECN), dorsal attention (DAN), and salience networks (SN) (Raichle,  ). In this study, we focus on these primary baseline FNs of rfMRI and calculate the functional network connectivity (FNC) between the FNs in lifelong musicians and matched controls. \n\nWith regard to cognitive brain reserve and cognitive flexibility: it should be noted that the distinctions between the terms used to characterize different types of brain reserve. Neurological (brain) reserve, one of the earliest terms proposed (Valenzuela and Sachdev,  ) is generally considered to be more biologically and genetically based, with two main definitions: \n  \n\u201cThe neurological brain reserve hypothesis proposes that individuals generally differ in the numbers of neurons and synapses available to be lost before clinical symptoms emerge.\u201d (Stern,  ). \n  \n\u201cBrain reserve refers to \u2018passive\u2019 factors (e.g. brain volume, synapse count) that confer a particular capacity to endure neuropathological processes until a critical threshold is reached, after which cognitive and functional impairments are expressed.\u201d (Guzman-Velez and Tranel,  ). \n  \nBy contrast, cognitive reserve, also called behavioral brain reserve, is acquired through specific sensory\u2013motor activities that span across the life cycle (including but not restricted to musicianship and bilingualism). This type of cognitive brain reserve is considered \u201cresilience to neural insult\u201d and strategies that strengthen alternative FNs across the life cycle can improve tolerance of atrophy (Bialystok   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Moreover, higher cognitive reserve should require more structural decline for symptoms to manifest (Gold   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). For more discussion on cognitive reserve, see Craik   et\u00a0al.   ( ), Andrews   et\u00a0al.   ( ;  ), Andrews ( ), and De Bot   et\u00a0al.   ( ). \n\nAnother body of research that is relevant in the context of the current analysis focuses on enhanced cognitive flexibility. Studies involving cognitive flexibility have included a range of cohorts as well as different types of development, including the trajectory of learning in infants who are raised in bilingual environments (Kovacs and Mehler,  ), studies of the neurophysiological correlates of flexibility (Mastria   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), correlates of network flexibility and functional connectivity (Betzel   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), and specific efforts to identify connections with neural substrates and specific networks (e.g. executive control, default mode and others) (Dajani and Uddin,  ). We will return to the notions of cognitive reserve and cognitive flexibility in the Discussion section. \n\nThis study is novel in two main ways. First, musicians included in this study are lifelong musicians with many years of musical training and experience, and currently practicing music multiple hours per week. This is a rare cohort and to our knowledge this level of musicianship has not been investigated in previous studies. Second, we apply a data driven approach called independent component analysis (ICA) (Bell and Sejnowski,  ) where analyses are not limited to  a priori   ROI. Limiting analyses to known ROI can miss brain regions that are relevant to musicianship and important hubs of the FNs may not be fully characterized. ICA uncovers FNs that are relevant to the rfMRI data obtained from study participants by applying spatial independence between FNs. FNC, or the temporal correlations between the FNs identified by ICA, is evaluated to understand brain function at the systems level. We expect to see FNC differences between the musicians and age matched controls in FNs that are relevant to musicianship, namely the DMN, AUN, SMN, and VSN. Each of these FNs is clearly identified in our rfMRI dataset of 16 participants (eight musicians and eight non-musicians). In addition, we examine how FNCs between these FNs change across the lifespan. We predict that the FNC between these FNs will increase with age in musicians. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixteen participants (eight musicians and eight non-musician controls) gave written consent in accord with the guidelines of Duke Health Institutional Review Board. All participants were MRI scanned in 2019\u20132021 at Duke University Hospital at the Duke Brain Imaging and Analysis Center: \n\nMusicians were between the ages of 20 and 67 years, with a mean age of 44.1 years (five females and three males) and controls were between the ages of 20 and 63 years, with a mean age of 43 years (five females and three males). Participants in both groups have college degrees that span the baccalaureate (completed or in progress) through the MA or MS and PhD, and one with an Associate's degree. \n\nAll eight musicians began musical training between the ages of 3 and 12 years, at an average age of 6.4 years. The number of years the participants had been musicians was a correlate of chronological age since all were currently active musicians, performing regularly with an average of 38 years of active musicianship. Musicians reported an average of 3 hours per day rehearsing and\/or practicing and an average of 9 hours per day in peak times (i.e. during periods of performance). Additional credentials included college degrees in music (including undergraduate minor, master's, and doctorate) and multiple affiliations with orchestras, symphonies, or operatic theatres in the USA and abroad. Five of the professional musicians had extensive experience in the USA and abroad. All participants played at least the piano or violin. The eight non-musician control participants do not play any instruments and do not sing in any groups. Four of the eight have never played a musical instrument, three played in high school between 14 and 18 years of age, and one played for 6 months at the age of 14. This yields a mean of 35 years since any of the controls were actively involved in playing a musical instrument. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nAll participants were scanned in the same scanner at Duke University Hospital, using a GE 3T Discovery 750 MRI (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. Anatomical T1-weighted images were acquired, using a FSPGR sequence, with an echo time (TE) = 2.9 ms, repetition time (TR) = 7.6 ms, inversion time (TI) = 450 ms, flip angle of 12\u00b0, with an reconstructed image size of 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0162 and a voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0 mm . The functional imaging sequence was an interleaved T2* weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence with 34 axial slices that were 4 mm thick, with a flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, TE\u00a0=\u00a030 ms, and a 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 in-plane matrix with a 24 cm field of view. A total of 155 time points were acquired per participant with a TR of 2000 ms. \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nThe structural brain images were skull stripped and normalized to MNI using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) (Avants   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Functional images were preprocessed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Smith   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Woolrich   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Jenkinson   et\u00a0al.  ,  ) with the exception of the registration step. All functional images were preprocessed using the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT, a part of FSL), including slice time correction, motion correction, high pass filter above 0.01 Hz, and registration from functional space to native structural space. All registrations from native structural space to MNI were performed using ANTs, including for functional images. All participants\u2019 fMRI masks were combined into a group mask, using a voxel-wise logical \u2018AND\u2019 operator for all 16 participants. This group mask was used for all participants before running GIFT (Calhoun   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Calhoun   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). GIFT was run as a standard ICA to estimate 20 independent components (networks), using the Infomax algorithm (Bell and Sejnowski,  ). The 20 components were further reduced first by excluding the artefactual FNs and then selecting the rfMRI FNs that matched previous literature (Raichle,  ;  ). We then picked four FNs (DMN, AUN, SMN, and VSN) for further analysis as they have been implicated as being related to musical skills according to previous literature on musicianship (Bangert   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; de Aquino   et\u00a0al.  ,  ; Belden   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). To ensure that motion is not driving FNC, FN time courses from the GIFT software were nuisance regressed using MCFLIRT's six motion parameters. This regression was done using MATLAB's regstats function (MATLAB v.9.1 and Statistics Toolbox v.12.1, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The FNC between pairs of FNs was calculated by computing the temporal correlation between their time courses output by the ICA algorithm. The correlation between FN time courses was computed using MATLAB's corrcoef function. Finally, the FNC matrix between the four FNs of interest was constructed using the correlation between the FN pairs. \n\n\n### Statistics \n  \nThis study examines whether the linear regressions between FNC and age are different between the musicians and the control group. We compare the slope difference between the two groups for each pair of FN using a test for parallelism (Kleinbaum   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Two-sided tests were performed for all FN pairs. Then we combine the   P  values for all FNs using Fisher's method (Fisher,  ). As FNs within the same subject may be dependent, we adjust Fisher's pooled test for such dependence by using a method to calculate the effective number of tests as given by Li and Ji ( ). The adjustment uses the poolr R software package written by Ozan Cinar and Wolfgang Viechtbauer.   P   values below a threshold of 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe DMN, AUN, SMN, and VSN derived using rfMRI data of both musicians and controls using the GIFT toolbox are presented in Fig.\u00a0 . These FNs were selected based on the spatial similarity of these FNs with the FNs in Raichle's original work (Raichle,  ). The FNs presented in Fig.\u00a0  are group averages across all participants. \n  \nThe sagittal, coronal, and axial views of the default mode (DMN), auditory (AUN), sensorimotor (SMN), and visual (VSN) networks derived from rfMRI of musicians and controls. The networks displayed are the group averages across all participants and are in the MNI152 space (MNI coordinates of these views are in parentheses). \n  \nWe then calculated the FNC values between the time courses of the four FNs for each participant. For each participant, a total of six FNC values (pairs of two from the four FNs) were calculated. The average FNC values for the musicians and controls are presented in Table\u00a0 . We then performed a two-sided two-sample   t   test on FNC values between the musician and control groups. We found a statistically significant (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.02, uncorrected for multiple testing) FNC group difference between the musicians and controls between the DMN and VSN. We also note that for all six FNC values the musicians had a lower average FNC value compared to the controls. \n  \nAverage group FNC of musicians and controls and FNC difference between the groups \n  \nFNC values presented in Table\u00a0  are presented in Fig.\u00a0  as connectograms. The average FNC values for each group, as well as the   t  -value of group difference, are represented by the color of the line connecting the FNs. The darker colors in the control group denote higher FNC values in controls. \n  \nAverage FNC in musicians, controls, and musician versus control differences for all pairs of FNs. The FNC value between each network pair is depicted by the connecting line color. The asterisk denotes a statistically significant (uncorrected) FNC difference between the musicians and controls. \n  \nThe FNC values reported in Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0  are group averages across a wide age range. We examine the effect of age in Fig.\u00a0 . In Fig.\u00a0 , we plot the mean FNC of all six FNC pairs for each participant against their age. We note that the slope of the musicians\u2019 regression line is positive and that of controls\u2019 is negative, indicating that FNC in musicians increased with age, whereas FNC in controls decreased with age. Linear regression analysis was performed with FNC as the dependent variable and age as the independent variable. The test for parallelism indicated that the slopes of the musician and control groups were significantly different (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.013, two-sided). \n  \nSimple linear regression between mean FNC and age for the musician (red) and control (blue) groups. Mean FNC was calculated across all six FNC pairs. Each open circle is a control participant measure, and each cross is a musician measure. The slopes of the two regressions are significantly different (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.013). \n  \nIn Fig.\u00a0  we plot the FNC trajectories for each of the six FNCs. We note that FNC values are decreasing in controls with age in the DMN\u2013AUN, DMN\u2013SMN, AUN\u2013SMN, and SMN\u2013VSN; are stable in AUN-VSN; and increase in DMN\u2013VSN. In musicians, FNC values are increasing with age in DMN\u2013AUN, DMN\u2013VSN, and SMN\u2013VSN; are stable in DMN\u2013SMN and AUN\u2013SMN; and decrease slightly in AUN\u2013VSN. In summary, the musicians generally show increasing FNC with age, and the controls generally show a decreasing trend. When the test for parallelism was applied on the regression lines to evaluate the statistical significance of group interaction, we note that the group interaction for the AUN\u2013SMN was statistically significant (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.03, uncorrected) and for DMN\u2013AUN and DMN\u2013SMN group interactions were approaching significance. \n  \nAge trajectory of FNC for six FNC pairs, musicians in red crosses and controls in blue circles.   P  values denote the statistical significance of interaction terms between the groups. \n  \nUsing the SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)   F   test, we pooled equations to test for parallelism (Kleinbaum   et\u00a0al.  ,  ) across all six FNC pairs. We combined the six network pairs using Fisher's method and adjusted for dependence as explained in the Methods section. The dependence analysis estimated the effective dependence in the dataset by calculating the empirical 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 correlation matrix from all FNC values of Fig.\u00a0  (six FNC pairs across all 16 participants). We then used the poolr function meff, and the standard pooling technique for dependent   P   values (Li and Ji,  ). The meff function used the correlation matrix and found that the effective number of tests or dependence was five (out of six, which is the case of full independence). With this adjustment of the pooled   P   values, the combined   P   value equals 0.0389. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we find that musicians have increasing FNC with age compared to matched control participants. Using ICA, as is done in the Allen   et\u00a0al.   ( ) study, we find a decrease in FNC with age in four of the six FN pairs in control participants, and an increase in FNC in three of the six pairs in musicians. The only exception is a very slight increase in controls in the DMN\u2013VSN FNC and a dramatic increase in the musicians. Further, we find that the average FNC across all six pairs of FNs increases with age in musicians and decreases in controls. This finding could be important in terms of musicianship and building cognitive reserve, and argue that the aging effect on FNC experienced by the controls may be enhanced or at least mitigated in musicians. \n\nThere are important studies that have examined changes in structural and functional connectivity in healthy aging with findings that are relevant to current work. Allen   et\u00a0al.   ( ) focused on the important question of determining baselines for comparison of rfMRI FNs using ICA. They analyzed 603 healthy participants ranging in age from 12 to 71 years. Their cross-sectional study showed that FNC decreased in older participants. In Zhang   et\u00a0al.   ( ) the decrease in FC with age was evident even in early adulthood (22\u201336 years). In Zhang   et\u00a0al.   ( ), close to 500 healthy individuals from the human connectome project were investigated using an ROI approach and the age effect on FC was significant even after controlling for cognitive measures. These two studies indicate decrease in FC both between FNs, as well as between ROI applying two different analytic approaches. Ferreira and Busatto ( ) conducted a meta-analysis and summarized results from rfMRI studies that focused on aging-related FC. They noted a significant increase in neuroimaging studies that examined the effects of aging on rfMRI since 2009 that corresponds to the body of evidence arguing for the importance of examining intrinsic brain activity in healthy function. They reported that findings consistently showed a decreased FC in the DMN, as well as attention networks, SMN, and others. On the other hand, they referred to studies that found increased FC in motor and subcortical networks, suggesting that age-related FC changes may be different between motor and subcortical networks, in contradistinction to the DMN and attention FNs (Tomasi and Volkow,  ). Betzel   et\u00a0al.   ( ) examined rfMRI in aging and included FCs both within and between FNs. Using the public data from the Nathan Kline Institute, 126 participants from 7\u201385 years of age were included. Their results indicated an interpretation of decreasing FC within FNs and increasing FC between FNs. \n\nBetzel   et\u00a0al.   ( ) also noted that there is compelling evidence that structural connectivity and FC are related, where structural connectivity may cause changes in FC patterns (Betzel   et\u00a0al.  ,  ). Our recent DTI study of subcortical white matter fiber tracks in musicians (Andrews   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), indeed showed that the structural integrity of white matter tracts was higher in musicians. In that study, we found that fractional anisotropy (FA) values the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus were higher in lifelong musicians compared to matched controls. The same was also true in the bilateral SS, a tract important for bilingualism. The results of this DTI study also suggested that lifelong musicianship may affect the expected decrease in FA values in these subcortical tracts, and, in fact, lead to greater integrity in aging. In sum, the trajectories of FA in the DTI study and FC in the current rfMRI follow a similar pattern in both musicians and controls. These studies may indicate that function follows form, and future studies are needed to confirm the reproducibility of this finding. \n\nPrevious studies that focus on creativity and improvization in musicians are all ROI seed-based analyses. Our study is unique as it examines FC between different networks in lifelong highest proficiency musicians and matched controls who have very little or no musicianship. The current study applies a data driven approach where analyses were not limited to   a priori   ROI. As noted before, limiting analyses to known ROI may fail to take into account brain regions that are relevant to musicianship and fail to include these brain regions in relevant networks. An interesting point to note is in the differences in FNC in musicians and controls at the younger end of the spectrum at around 20 years. de Aquino   et\u00a0al.  ( ) suggested that musicians have less activation in the DMN than nonmusicians. It is unclear whether lesser DMN activation led to decreased DMN FNC and this question merits future research. \n\nAnother body of research that is relevant in the context of the current analysis focuses on enhanced cognitive flexibility. Studies involving cognitive flexibility have included a range of cohorts as well as different types of development, including the trajectory of learning in infants who are raised in bilingual environments (Kovacs and Mehler,  ), studies of neurophysiological correlates of flexibility (Mastria   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), correlates of network flexibility and FC (Betzel   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), and specific efforts to identify connections with neural substrates and specific networks (e.g. executive control, default mode and others) (Dajani and Uddin,  ). Our results indicate that the younger musicians in our group of participants show lower FNC compared to their age matched controls. It is unclear whether this phenomenon can be attributed to higher cognitive flexibility and this question warrants further investigation. \n\nEarly and current research on the building of cognitive brain reserve has focused primarily on bilingualism and other specific, high-end cognitive demand activities and lifestyles that may play a role in building cognitive brain reserve, including volume changes in gray matter and white matter, increased structural connectivity, enhanced categorical perception, and a potential protective effect in delaying the onset of symptoms of pathology and dementia. Studies of cognitive reserve in musicians also show similar findings given in the literature on bilingualism. It has been shown in multiple studies that white matter integrity decreases in normal aging, which provides a background for understanding the differences seen in research of building cognitive reserve (see previously), where the process of loss of integrity of white matter fiber tracts can be slowed down or changed by lifelong bilingualism and musicianship. In the current study, we explore how FNC between four FNs (DMN, AUN, SMN, VSN) important in musicianship show an increase in musicians and a decrease in controls. Preliminary findings from the study suggest a possible interaction between structural connectivity and functional connectivity. \n\nThis study is an initial step in a series of future work that will focus on using rfMRI to analyze the changes found in lifelong high-end sensory motor activities (e.g. musicianship and multilingualism) and how these lifestyles contribute to building of cognitive brain reserve and other positive effects for healthy cognition in aging. \n\nThe COVID-19 crisis resulted in restricted access to Duke Hospital and to the scanners, which were unavailable for several months, thus limiting the overall number of participants. Future directions include a replication of the results across a larger data set of musicians and non-musician controls, exploration of how FNC plays a role in healthy aging and building cognitive brain reserve, and investigation of the functional activations and connectivity through fMRI and other direct comparisons of musicians and bi- or multilinguals. Lifelong, highly proficient musicians who have decades of active musicianship and who are also willing to volunteer to participate in a brain MRI study is a rare cohort. Studies with a larger number of participants of this level of professional musicianship will require significant recruitment time. Conducting studies that incorporate task fMRI, DTI, and other structural changes, including notions of cognitive flexibility are needed. Further, studies are needed to know how these brain findings transfer to behavioral and cognitive domains, and especially how they affect cognitive brain reserve. In this study, we attribute the difference in FNC to lifelong musicianship. The results reported here may potentially be related to a confounding variable that is associated with musicianship, for example, the number of hours of disciplined practice. Future studies are needed to dissociate such variables from musicianship. In addition, longitudinal studies are needed to further validate our findings. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn this exploratory study, we have analyzed rfMRI data from lifelong musicians. We hypothesized that musicians will have higher levels of FNC than controls between four FNs: the DMN, AUN, SMN, and the VSN. These networks are important in musicianship and each of these FNs were clearly identified in our data set of 16 participants (eight musicians and eight non-musicians). We examined how FNCs between FNs change across the lifespan of the participants and found that the FNCs generally increased in musicians and decreased in controls. Given the increase in white matter integrity found in these musicians in an earlier study (Andrews   et\u00a0al.  ,  ), it is possible that this finding recapitulates the possible interaction between structural connectivity and functional connectivity discussed in Betzel   et\u00a0al.   ( ), in which structural connectivity changes may affect changes in functional connectivity patterns across the life span. It should be noted that our results are based on correlation and not causation. Further investigations are needed to establish the direct causal effect of music on cognitive reserve. Results of this study are preliminary and need to be replicated with a larger number of participants. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10917383,"text_md5":"98ea11bbb522e641aef8a1c154ec68d7","field_positions":{"authors":[0,68],"journal":[69,84],"publication_year":[86,90],"title":[101,160],"keywords":[174,308],"abstract":[321,2031],"body":[2040,30999]},"batch":3,"pmid":38666119,"doi":"10.1093\/psyrad\/kkad003","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917383","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10917383"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10917383\">10917383<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10917383  Resting-state functional connectivity in lifelong musicians"}

However, the inter\u2010individual variability in functional networks and brain function\u2010structural dissociations pose challenges when relying solely on group\u2010level atlases or anatomical landmarks for surgical guidance. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a personalized functional mapping technique for verbal memory using precision resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) and neurosurgery. A total of 38 patients with refractory epilepsy scheduled for surgical interventions were enrolled and 28 patients were analyzed in the study. Baseline 30\u2010min rs\u2010fMRI scanning, verbal memory and language assessments were collected for each patient before surgery. Personalized verbal memory networks (PVMN) were delineated based on preoperative rs\u2010fMRI data for each patient. The accuracy of PVMN was assessed by comparing post\u2010operative functional impairments and the overlapping extent between PVMN and surgical lesions. A total of 14 out of 28 patients experienced clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory after surgery. The personalized network and the group\u2010level atlas exhibited 100% and 75.0% accuracy in predicting postoperative verbal memory declines, respectively. Moreover, six patients with extra\u2010temporal lesions that overlapped with PVMN showed selective impairments in verbal memory. Furthermore, the lesioned ratio of the personalized network rather than the group\u2010level atlas was significantly correlated with postoperative declines in verbal memory (personalized networks:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038; group\u2010level atlas:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332). In conclusion, our personalized functional mapping technique, using precision rs\u2010fMRI, offers valuable insights into individual variability in the verbal memory network and holds promise in precision verbal memory network mapping in individuals. \n  \nWe used precision resting\u2010state functional MRI to map personalized verbal memory network (PVMN) for each treatment\u2010resistant epilepsy patient. PVMN, instead of group\u2010level functional atlases, effectively predicted post\u2010operative verbal memory impairments according to its spatial overlap with surgical lesions, indicating the precision PVMN mapping in individuals.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nPresurgical planning plays a critical role in optimizing neurosurgical outcomes, with the aim to remove pathological areas while ensuring the maximum preservation of surrounding critical functional regions. Epilepsy neurosurgeries, such as anterior temporal lobe resections, achieve high remission rates (de Tisi et al.,\u00a0 ), but carry a significant risk of postoperative declines in verbal memory (Binder,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ), which may greatly impair the quality of life of patients (Bell et al.,\u00a0 ; Langfitt et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nConsiderable efforts have been dedicated to identifying predictive factors for postoperative verbal memory impairment (Binder et al.,\u00a0 ; Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ), contributing to our understanding of potential postoperative outcomes. In addition to prognostic predictions, determining the optimal extent of surgical resection is crucial for presurgical decision\u2010making. Several retrospective studies have proposed empirical guidelines for clinical practice based on anatomical landmarks (Sone et al.,\u00a0 ; Szaflarski et al.,\u00a0 ). However, due to significant inter\u2010individual variability in the functional organization of higher\u2010order cognition (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Xu, et al.,\u00a0 ), such as verbal memory (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ), and the existence of functional idiosyncrasies that extend beyond anatomical restrictions (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Nenning et al.,\u00a0 ), the precision delineation of a personalized functional margin for verbal memory becomes critical for optimal presurgical decision\u2010making aimed at preserving verbal memory. Moreover, the personalized mapping may also offer unique contributions to the accurate prediction of functional outcomes. \n\nRecently, increasing attention has been given to the involvement of extra\u2010temporal brain regions in verbal memory processing, alongside the well\u2010established focus on focal surgical lesions within the temporal lobe (Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). From a brain network perspective, these temporal and extra\u2010temporal regions are likely interconnected, given that the human brain is functionally organized into multiple distributed functional networks (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, lesions occurring in any brain region within the functional network could lead to corresponding functional impairments (Fox,\u00a0 ). Despite this, the specific characteristics and functional significance of the verbal memory network still remain understudied. \n\nRecent advancements in precision resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) have demonstrated significant potential in facilitating reliable and accurate personalized functional network mapping (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). Rs\u2010fMRI simply requires patients remaining still without engaging in any specific cognitive tasks, is generally better tolerated by patients, particularly those who have impairments in verbal memory. Furthermore, the personalized functional network mapping derived from task\u2010free fMRI data could unveil individual differences in task activations (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Tavor et al.,\u00a0 ) and has been validated through invasive approaches (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Smith et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe objective of this study is to develop and validate a personalized functional network mapping technique for verbal memory using precision rs\u2010fMRI, aiming to provide a complementary tool for presurgical decision\u2010making. To achieve this, we delineated a personalized verbal memory network (PVMN) based on each patient's presurgical rs\u2010fMRI data. Moreover, we assessed the spatial overlap between the surgical lesion and the personalized network to predict the likelihood and extent of functional impairments. This personalized approach may offer valuable insights into preserving verbal memory and serves as an important aid in presurgical planning. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nPatients diagnosed with refectory epilepsy were recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (FAH\u2010FMU) between 2019 and 2021. The inclusion criteria for participant selection were as follows: (1) age ranging from 16 to 60\u2009years old; (2) presence of at least one treatment\u2010resistant epileptic focus located within the temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, or the parietal lobe; (3) right\u2010handedness determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; and (4) scheduled for surgical intervention, such as temporal lobe resection or radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF\u2010TC), following completion of multimodal preoperative assessment, which involved scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), cranial MRI, and\/or brain positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\u2010CT). Exclusion criteria included the presence of: (1) space\u2010occupying lesions before the surgeries; (2) contraindications to undergoing MRI examinations; or (3) cognitive impairments impeding the ability to cooperate with neuropsychological cognitive assessments. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of FAH\u2010FMU. All patients or their caregivers were informed of the precautions before enrollment and signed the informed consent. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological assessments \n  \nAll participants included in the study underwent baseline assessments of verbal memory and language prior to their respective surgical procedures. Post\u2010operative assessments were conducted within 1\u20132\u2009weeks following the surgeries. The specific timing of these assessments was determined by physicians and experienced assessors, ensuring that patients' post\u2010operative conditions had sufficiently stabilized to facilitate their participation in neuropsychological evaluations. The choice of a relatively short post\u2010operative interval was deliberate, aimed at achieving a balance between mitigating potential confounding effects stemming from functional reorganization processes that may evolve over time as a consequence of surgical lesions and ensuring the stable recovery conditions of patients after surgery. In addition, pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative evaluations were performed by the same experienced assessors to minimize potential evaluation biases. \n\nVerbal memory function was evaluated using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), which assessed both immediate and delayed recall (Schmidt,\u00a0 ). The score of the AVLT immediate recall (AVLT\u2010immediate) was determined based on the number of correctly recalled words from the 5\u2010time repeated 15\u2010word vocabulary list, with a maximum score of 75. Following a 30\u2010min interval, the list was recalled once more to assess the participants' delayed memory retrieval ability. The score of the AVLT delayed recall (AVLT\u2010delayed) was also calculated based on the number of correctly recalled words, with a maximum score of 15. AVLT\u2010delayed score is particularly critical for evaluating the consolidation and retention aspects of verbal memory (Alpherts et al.,\u00a0 ; Cotton & Ricker,\u00a0 ). This includes remembering important information after a lapse in time, which measures the practical memory challenge that patients may face in daily experiences. Therefore, we focused on the AVLT\u2010delayed score for the main analyses. To address the concern of whether changes in a test score for an individual patient are statistically reliable or merely due to measurement error in clinical settings, we used the reliable change index (RCI) as the cutoff value to determine whether there was a decline in verbal memory or not. A clinically meaningful decline in verbal memory was defined as a decrease of 4 points or more in the AVLT\u2010delayed score after surgery compared to baseline, determined using the RCI (Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Sawrie et al.,\u00a0 ). To examine whether the observed declines were specific to verbal memory rather than being influenced by language impairment, we also assessed their language abilities served as a control in our study. Language assessment was conducted using the Chinese version of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), a comprehensive evaluation tool for language impairment (Kertesz & Poole,\u00a0 ). The WAB aphasia quotient (WAB\u2010AQ) was used as a summarized score, ranging from 0 to 100, to assess overall language function. A 5\u2010point change is regarded as a clinically significant change (Godecke et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nDuring the interval from the surgeries to post\u2010operative assessments, no post\u2010operative complications that could affected the cognitive performance occurred in any of the 28 patients. All patients were seizure\u2010free during the interval and their pre\u2010operative seizure frequencies showed no differences between patients with and without AVLT\u2010delayed (two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.38,   p  \u2009=\u2009.71), thereby minimizing the possibility of cognitive performance being impacted by seizures. Following surgery, we maintained the type and dosage of anti\u2010seizure medications that patients were prescribed prior to the operation. Within one\u2010week post\u2010surgery, all patients were able to adhere to their medication regimen from before the surgery. Furthermore, no medications known to potentially cause cognitive impairment were administered during this period, thus eliminating the possibility of medication changes influencing cognitive scores. \n\n\n###  MRI   data acquisition \n  \nParticipants underwent structural and functional MRI scanning before surgeries. MRI data were collected using a Skyra 3.0T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32\u2010channel head coil at the FAH\u2010FMU. High\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted (T1w) anatomical images were acquired using an MPRAGE 3D T1w sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.09\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix, 192 sagittal slices, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ). Additionally, high\u2010resolution T2w images were acquired using the 3D T2w fluid\u2010attenuated inversion recovery sequence (TR\u2009=\u20095000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u2009387\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230, 230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230 matrix, 192 sagittal slices, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm ). Rs\u2010fMRI was acquired with an echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (TR\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 matrix, 50 slices, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009mm ). Participants were required to keep their bodies and heads still, eyes closed, and not to fall asleep during the entire scanning. To ensure a sufficient data amount of rs\u2010fMRI for reliable personalized functional mapping, each rs\u2010fMRI session included three repeated runs (29\u2009min 33\u2009s in total) for each participant. All patients underwent a post\u2010operative MRI session a week after surgeries. The session included T1w and T2w FLAIR scans to identify lesion locations. \n\n\n###  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nBoth rs\u2010fMRI and structural data were processed using the pBFS Cloud v1.0.7 (Neural Galaxy Inc., Beijng). The preprocessing pipeline was developed according to our previously described pipelines (Ren et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Hubbard, et al.,\u00a0 ; Ren, Xu, et al.,\u00a0 ). The fMRI preprocessing pipeline includes (1) slice timing correction, (2) rigid body correction, (3) linear detrending and bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz), and (4) regression of nuisance variables, including six motion parameters, white\u2010matter signal, ventricular signal, global signal, and their first temporal derivatives. \n\nT1w images were processed using the FreeSurfer version 6.0.0 software package ( ). The intracranial volume was estimated for each patient based on the brain segmentation. Surface mesh representations of individual cerebral cortices were reconstructed from the T1w images and non\u2010linearly aligned to a common spherical coordinate system. For coregistration, the functional and structural images were affinely aligned using boundary\u2010based registration from the FsFast software package ( ). Subsequently, the preprocessed functional images were registered to the FreeSurfer cortical surface template (fsaverage6). A 6\u2010mm full\u2010width half\u2010maximum (FWHM) surface smoothing kernel was then applied to the fMRI data on the cortical surface. Additionally, the preprocessed functional images were spatially normalized to a volumetric template with a 2\u2010mm spatial resolution (the MNI152 template) using volumetric nonlinear registration facilitated by the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). Following the normalization step, a 6\u2010mm FWHM smoothing kernel was applied to the registered fMRI data within the brain mask. \n\n\n### Lesion segmentation \n  \nA surgical lesion mask was manually delineated on the native structural image for each participant. Specifically, the post\u2010operative T1w and T2w FLAIR were affinely aligned to pre\u2010operative T1w images using the ANTs. Subsequently, an experienced neurosurgeon manually delineated the lesion boundaries slice by slice using the MRIcron v1.0 software ( ). It is important to note that while the majority of patients exhibited limited perilesional edemas, a subset of patients presented with significant edematous regions. These areas can be considered as transient and reversible \u201clesions,\u201d in addition to the surgical lesion, and have the potential to impact cognitive functions. Consequently, to ensure comprehensive lesion mapping, the perilesional edemas were incorporated into the lesion masks. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the lesion masks were then re\u2010evaluated and confirmed by a senior neuroradiologist and a senior neurosurgeon. \n\n\n### Identifying functional network specifically associated with verbal memory \n  \nThe functional architecture of the cerebral cortex is organized into multiple large\u2010scale, parallel functional networks, each dedicated to specific functions and collaborating with other networks to facilitate our daily activities (Braga & Buckner,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). To identify a specific functional network associated with verbal memory, we conducted a two\u2010fold analysis. Initially, a group\u2010level functional atlas comprising 7 large\u2010scale canonical functional networks was estimated using data from 1000 healthy participants, as described in previous studies (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). To identify which network is most closely associated with verbal memory processing, we generated a meta\u2010analysis association map focused on \u201csemantic memory,\u201d incorporating 123 studies, using NeuroSynth (Yarkoni et al.,\u00a0 ) ( ). The map was thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, corrected for false discovery rate (Figure\u00a0 ). By directly comparing the map and the overlap with each network, we found that the default mode network (DMN) displays the largest proportion of activated volume. However, considering the functional heterogeneity within the DMN, previous research has demonstrated the existence of at least two parallel subnetworks within the DMN (Braga & Buckner,\u00a0 ; Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ). To enhance the specificity of our defined network for verbal memory, we further subdivided the DMN into two networks. \n\nSpecifically, we utilized data from the same 1000 subjects from the GSP dataset as employed by Yeo and colleagues (Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ). We applied the K\u2010means clustering strategy to the DMN voxels, using the RSFC profile of each voxel to 1175 cortical ROIs as features (for more details in [Yeo et al.,\u00a0 ]), to divide it into 2 subnetworks. The initial seed of the clustering for one cluster was based on the average RSFC profiles across voxels within the region identified by the Neurosynth map (Figure\u00a0 ), while the initial seed for the other cluster was based on the average RSFC profiles across voxels within the DMN, excluding the Neurosynth map region. Following the clustering procedure, we parcellated the DMN into two subnetworks (Figure\u00a0 ). One network, highly correlated with the RSFC map of the Neurosynth map (  r  \u2009=\u20090.92), was named the verbal memory network (VMN), which is more specifically associated with verbal memory functions (Figure\u00a0 ). The other network, less correlated with the map (  r  \u2009=\u20090.57), was named the fronto\u2010temporal network (FTN), reflecting its anatomical locations. Additionally, we observed evident differences in the functional connectivity between the two subnetworks (Figure\u00a0 ), indicating their functional dissociations. Based on the specific VMN and the 8\u2010network group\u2010level functional atlas, we performed the following personalized parcellation. \n\n\n###  PVMN   mapping \n  \nTopographies of personalized functional networks, particularly higher\u2010order cognitive networks, exhibit significant variability among individuals (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ). Consequently, it is essential to perform PVMN mapping for precise presurgical planning. To achieve this, we applied a personalized functional network mapping technique adapted from our previous reports (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Briefly, to initiate the individualization procedure, we projected the group\u2010level 8\u2010network functional atlas onto each individual's cerebral cortex. Guided by the group\u2010level functional atlas, the functional network boundaries for each patient were refined in an iterative manner. First, for each cortical voxel, we calculated the similarity between its timeseries and averaged timeseries across voxels within each functional network. Second, the voxels were assigned to the network with the largest similarity. Functional network boundaries for each patient thus were refreshed and further guided the next iteration. During this iterative process, spatial distributions of inter\u2010individual variability in resting\u2010state functional connectivity (RSFC) and temporal signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (tSNR) were taken into account as weighting factors in averaging timeseries (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Vertices exhibiting greater inter\u2010individual variability were assigned higher weights to ensure adequate incorporation of individual\u2010specific functional information from these regions. Additionally, vertices with higher tSNR were assigned higher weights to promote iterative stability and mitigate the influence of noise. The iterative procedure continued until reaching the 10th iteration, a predefined number of iterations established empirically based on findings from our previous studies (Wang et al.,\u00a0 ), resulting in a surface\u2010based personalized functional parcellation. Subsequently, we mapped the volumetric PVMN for each patient by utilizing their individual\u2010specific RSFC seeded from the surface\u2010based personalized verbal memory network. RSFC was estimated by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the average timeseries across the voxels within the network and the timeseries of each brain voxel, and was further normalized using the Fisher's   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. To ensure reliability and control noise, we applied an RSFC threshold of 0.3 to yield a binarized volumetric PVMN. This mapping technique allowed us to reliably delineate PVMN, as it leveraged our knowledge of organizational principles shared by the population while maximizing the utilization of information inherent in each individual's unique data. \n\n\n### Laterality index of the   PVMN  \n  \nThe laterality index (LI) of the PVMN was calculated following the previous study (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ), using the following equation: where   and   represent the number of vertices within the left\u2010 and right\u2010hemisphere PVMN, respectively. A positive LI indicates a left\u2010lateralized map, while a negative LI indicates a right\u2010lateralized one. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nTo compare the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative cognitive assessments, we performed paired sample   t  \u2010tests in the AVLT\u2010delayed score, AVLT\u2010immediate score, and WAB\u2010AQ. Based on whether their AVLT\u2010delayed score decreased beyond the RCI, participants were divided into a declined and non\u2010declined group. The Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test was used to compare the differences in all assessment declines between the groups. The Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test was conducted to examine the verbal memory decline after surgery in the overlapped and non\u2010overlapped groups. Moreover, we performed Fisher's exact test to examine whether decrease in AVLT\u2010delayed score was associated with hippocampal resection and surgical types. \n\nTo establish an appropriate threshold of the overlap between surgical lesion and verbal memory network indicative of post\u2010operative decline, we employed a data\u2010driven approach to determine the hyper\u2010parameter within the classification framework. Specifically, the degree of the overlap between surgical lesion and verbal memory network was estimated by a lesion volume ratio for each patient. The lesion volume ratio of the verbal memory network by calculating the ratio of post\u2010operative lesion volume of the verbal memory network to the total intracranial volume (TIV) estimated by FreeSurfer. This normalization procedure allowed for comparison across varying brain sizes among patients. Subsequently, we implemented a nested leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation (LOOCV) process, known for its robustness in hyper\u2010parameter optimization (Cui et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ). This nested cross\u2010validation comprises an outer loop and an inner loop. Within each outer loop iteration, one sample was designated as the testing set, while the remaining 27 samples underwent an inner loop procedure, wherein they were divided into a training set (26 samples) and a validation set (1 sample) using another LOOCV process. The hyper\u2010parameter \u201coverlap threshold\u201d was optimized by assessing the classification performance of the inner LOOCV, thereby preventing information leakage from the test sample. This optimization procedure was conducted for both the PVMN and the group\u2010level atlas to ensure fair comparison. \n\nFollowing the determination of the overlap threshold, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the classification task in predicting declines in AVLT\u2010delayed scores. Additionally, we computed Pearson's correlation between AVLT\u2010delayed score declines and the ratios of lesion volume within a functional network or normalized lesion volumes. The normalized lesion volumes were calculated by the ratio of the total lesion volume to the TIV. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Patients, behaviors, and lesions \n  \nThirty\u2010eight patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy were screened. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of preoperative space\u2010occupying lesions, while six patients were additionally excluded due to failures to complete the postoperative follow\u2010up, resulting into a total of 28 patients in the study (20 temporal and 8 extra\u2010temporal lobe epilepsy; see Table\u00a0 ). The preoperative neuropsychological assessments, including AVLT\u2010delayed, AVLT\u2010immediate, and WAB\u2010AQ, were summarized and presented. The surgical procedures involved resection or RF\u2010TC to target the epileptic foci and yielded focal lesions. The surgeries resulted in a significant decline in AVLT\u2010delayed scores (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200910.07\u2009\u00b1\u20093.85 points; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u20096.68\u2009\u00b1\u20094.02 points; paired sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22124.26, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001), AVLT\u2010immediate scores (pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200948.14\u2009\u00b1\u200910.67 points; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u200940.93\u2009\u00b1\u200912.74 points;   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.74, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009=\u2009.030), and WAB\u2010AQ scores (pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200996.11\u2009\u00b1\u20093.09; post\u2010operative score\u2009=\u200992.72\u2009\u00b1\u20095.94;   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22123.10, Bonferroni corrected   p  \u2009=\u2009.014). Here we further focused on AVLT\u2010delayed scores in subsequent analyses. Using the RCI cutoff of 4 points, 14 out of 28 patients (50.0%) exhibited clinically meaningful declines in the delayed verbal memory after surgery. Patients undergoing RF\u2010TC exhibited a reduced likelihood of experiencing verbal memory decline compared to those undergoing resection (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20097.04,   p  \u2009=\u2009.008). This observation may result from differences in lesion sizes, as lesions resulting from resection procedures were significantly larger than those from RF\u2010TC (resection\u2009=\u200932.5\u2009\u00b1\u200934.1\u2009cm , RF\u2010TC\u2009=\u20095.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009cm , two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test,   t  \u2009=\u20092.76,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01). Consequently, resection lesions were more likely to overlap with the PVMN, thus potentially leading to verbal memory decline. The surgical lesion overlapping map revealed a spatial distribution of lesions locating not only in the temporal lobe but also in the extra\u2010temporal regions (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, patients with verbal memory decline predominantly exhibited lesions in the left temporal area, while those without declines mainly had right\u2010temporal lesions (Figure\u00a0 ), in line with prior studies (Saling,\u00a0 ; Sherman et al.,\u00a0 ). \n  \nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics. \n      \nPatients show impairments in verbal memory and language following temporal lobe surgeries. The bar graphs illustrate the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative scores for (A) Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) delayed recall, (B) AVLT immediate recall and (C) WAB\u2010AQ. Each dot line indicates the change trajectory of each patient. Both the verbal memory scores (paired sample   t  \u2010test, AVLT\u2010delayed recall:   p  \u2009<\u2009.001; AVLT\u2010immediate recall:   p  \u2009=\u2009.030) and language scores (WAB\u2010AQ:   p  \u2009=\u2009.014) show significant declines after surgeries. Error bars indicate the standard deviations. pre, pre\u2010operative scores; post, post\u2010operative scores; WAB\u2010AQ, Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient. \n    \nThe surgical lesion overlap map. Each participant's surgical lesion mask was manually delineated and overlaid onto a common brain template. The surgical lesion overlap map is shown at the axial view and thresholded at >0, revealing the distribution of surgical lesions across the whole brain. Areas with brighter colors represent regions where a higher number of patients had lesions, indicating common areas affected by surgery. Surgical lesions concentrated at the temporal lobe but also distributed in the frontal and parietal lobes. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   show individual differences in network topography and lateralization \n  \nThrough comparing the meta\u2010analysis activation map on verbal memory with group\u2010average canonical functional networks, we identified the network most associated with verbal memory processing is the default mode network (DMN; Figure\u00a0 ), known for its association with higher\u2010order language processing and memory functions (Gordon et al.,\u00a0 ; Wirth et al.,\u00a0 ). Due to substantial individual differences in functional network topographies (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ), personalized verbal memory mapping might be more valuable for presurgical planning than relying on the group\u2010level atlas. To this end, we leveraged individual\u2010specific RSFC to map PVMN. The personalized functional networks demonstrated relatively high consistency in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus, while showing notable inter\u2010individual variability in the anterior temporal lobes (Figure\u00a0 ). Moreover, 75% (21\/28) and 25% (7\/28) of patients show left\u2010 and right\u2010lateralized personalized functional networks, respectively. These left\u2010lateralized patterns are consistent with our and previous clinical observations, suggesting a higher likelihood of deficits following left temporal lobe resection compared to right temporal lobe resection (Saling,\u00a0 ; Sherman et al.,\u00a0 ). This alignment might be attributed to the larger volume of the verbal memory network in the left hemisphere, making it more susceptible to being resected during left\u2010hemisphere surgeries. \n  \nIndividual differences in topographies of personalized verbal memory networks. The network overlapping map represents the overlap of personalized verbal memory networks (PVMNs) across all participants. Brain areas depicted in warm colors (red and yellow) represent regions frequently included in the PVMNs of multiple patients, while regions in darker or cooler tones indicate less overlap. The map reveals less overlapping in the temporal lobe compared to the frontal and parietal lobes. This finding underscores the significance of personalized presurgical planning to preserve verbal memory before temporal lobe surgeries. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   can accurately predict the post\u2010operative declines \n  \nTo validate the accuracy of personalized verbal memory mapping, we classified patients into two groups based on whether their surgical lesions overlapped with the PVMN (the overlapped group vs. the non\u2010overlapped group). The overlap threshold was determined through the data\u2010driven procedure (see Methods). Consequently, patients with lesion volume ratios of the verbal memory network exceeding 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 , equivalent to 0.63\u2009cm , were classified into the overlapped group (see Figure\u00a0 ). Four representative patients from both groups are shown to illustrate the overlaps between PVMNs and their surgical lesions (Figure\u00a0 ). Notably, all patients in the overlapped group displayed clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory (14\/14), demonstrating 100% sensitivity. Their verbal memory exhibited a significant decrease in AVLT\u2010delayed score (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u200911.36\u2009\u00b1\u20093.37; post\u2010operative\u2009=\u20094.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.62; Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001). In contrast, none of the patients in the non\u2010overlapped group experienced clinically meaningful declines in verbal memory (14\/14), resulting in 100% specificity, and no significant difference was observed before and after surgeries (Figure\u00a0 ; pre\u2010operative\u2009=\u20098.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.98 points; post\u2010operative\u2009=\u20098.57\u2009\u00b1\u20093.57;   p  \u2009=\u2009.78). For comparison, we replicated the prediction analysis using the group\u2010level atlas, resulting into 85.7% (12\/14) of sensitivity, 71.4% (10\/14) of specificity, and 78.6% (22\/28) of overall accuracy (Figure\u00a0  for misclassified cases, and Figure\u00a0 ). Additionally, we performed the analysis utilizing the side of surgery as a predictor, specifically associating left\u2010hemisphere surgeries with post\u2010operative declines. The resulting sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 57.1% (8\/14), 71.4% (10\/14), and 64.3% (18\/28), respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). These results demonstrate that the personalized functional network mapping technique outperforms both the group\u2010level atlas and side of surgery in predicting postoperative verbal memory declines, highlighting the importance of individualized mapping approaches for guiding resection margin in presurgical planning. \n  \nPersonalized verbal memory networks predict verbal memory declines. Participants were divided into two groups based on whether their personalized verbal memory network overlapped with their surgical lesions. (A) Four representative examples from the overlapped group, PA02, PA17, PA20, and PA21, are shown. The left column displays pre\u2010 (upper panel) and post\u2010operative anatomical images (lower panel), depicting radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF\u2010TC) lesions in the right temporal lobe for PA02 and left temporal lobe for PA17, as well as left temporal lobe resections for PA20 and PA21. The center column illustrates the overlapping personalized verbal memory network, depicted in red, and the right column zooms in to provide a detailed view of the lesions and personalized network. The RF\u2010TC lesions are highlighted by orange arrows. (B) Four representative examples from the non\u2010overlapped group, PA04, PA05, PA06, and PA15, are shown. (C) The bar graph presents the pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delay scores in the overlapped group. All patients marked by red dot lines exhibit consistent and significant declines in verbal memory (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). (D) The bar graph of the non\u2010overlapped group demonstrates no significant declines in verbal memory (  p  \u2009=\u2009.78). Error bars represent standard deviations. pre, pre\u2010operative scores; post, post\u2010operative scores. \n    \nFalse positive and false negative cases according to the group\u2010level verbal memory network. All six patients who were inaccurately predicted based on the group\u2010level verbal memory network (VMN) are shown. (A) Four patients have been identified as false positives according to the group\u2010level atlas. These patients exhibited lesions that spatially overlapped with the group\u2010level default mode network (DMN) but did not demonstrate subsequent declines in postoperative verbal memory. The corresponding changes in their Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delayed score are detailed for each patient. (B) Two patients are false negative samples, having lesions that did not overlap with the group\u2010level VMN; however, this patient experienced clinically significant postoperative declines in verbal memory. \n  \n\n###  PVMNs   accurately localize extra\u2010temporal regions \n  \nWe further examined eight patients with surgical lesions in extra\u2010temporal regions in detail (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ), with six patients having lesions in the prefrontal cortex and two in the parietal lobe. Results showed that six out of eight patients demonstrated selective impairments in verbal memory. Specifically, these patients exhibited clinically meaningful declines in AVLT\u2010delayed scores following resections, ranging from 4\u2010 to 12\u2010point declines. However, their WAB\u2010AQ scores, which measure overall language impairment, remained relatively stable, with changes ranging from 0\u2010 to 2.8\u2010point decline. Importantly, we observed evident overlaps between the surgical lesions and the PVMN in the six patients, which aligned with the observed selective impairments in verbal memory (Figure\u00a0 ). In contrast, the patients without verbal memory impairment had a non\u2010overlapping PVMN with the surgical lesion (Figure\u00a0 ). This finding underscores the localization accuracy of our personalized functional mapping in extra\u2010temporal regions, further validating the utility and reliability of our approach in potential applications for precisely identifying critical functional regions for verbal memory. \n  \nPatients with lesions in the extra\u2010temporal areas of the personalized functional network show significant verbal memory declines. Eight patients whose surgical lesion located outside of temporal lobe were included in the study. (A) Six out of eight patients with evident overlapping between surgical lesions and the personalized verbal memory networks show clinical meaningful decline in verbal memory, ranging from 4 to 12 points. Meanwhile, their Western Aphasia Battery\u2010Aphasia Quotient (WAB\u2010AQ) exhibit no clinically important difference, with declines from 0 to 2.8 points. (B) Two patients without overlapping between the surgical lesions and the personalized networks show improvement or no change in verbal memory and language. \n  \n\n### Lesion extent of personalized networks can accurately predict the degree of post\u2010operative declines \n  \nMoreover, we sought to determine whether the personalized network could predict the degree of post\u2010operative functional declines according to the lesioned extent of the network. We found a significant correlation between the lesion volume ratio of the PVMN and the extent of post\u2010operative verbal memory declines (Figure\u00a0 ; Pearson's correlation,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038), indicating that a larger lesion volume ratio of the PVMN is associated with a greater degree of functional declines. However, no significant correlation was found when using the group\u2010level atlas (Figure\u00a0 ;   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332). This finding further supports the accuracy of the personalized network mapping and highlights the lesion volume ratio of the personalized network rather than the group\u2010level atlas as a valuable predictive factor for prognostics. \n  \nThe lesioned volume ratio of the verbal memory network is associated with verbal memory declines. The scatter plots display the relationship between the lesioned ratio of (A) the personalized verbal memory map and (B) the group\u2010level atlas with the post\u2010operative declines in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)\u2010delay scores. The black dots represent all individuals. The solid line represents the linear regression line that best fits the data. A significant negative correlation (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39,   p  \u2009=\u2009.038) is observed between the lesioned ratio of the personalized network and the post\u2010operative declines in AVLT\u2010delay scores. However, there is no significant correlation (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009.332) between the lesioned ratio of the group\u2010level atlas and the post\u2010operative declines in AVLT\u2010delay scores. These results indicate that a larger volume of lesions within the personalized network, rather than the group\u2010level atlas, is associated with more severe impairments in verbal memory after surgery. \n  \n\n### Control analyses \n  \nTo account for potential confounding factors influencing post\u2010operative verbal memory declines, we conducted several control analyses, including the assessments of (1) overall lesion volume, (2) other personalized networks, and (3) the presence of hippocampal lesions. First, we investigated the relationship between post\u2010operative verbal memory declines and normalized lesion volumes adjusted for intracranial volumes (Figure\u00a0 ). The analysis revealed no significant correlation (Pearson's correlation,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.24,   p  \u2009=\u2009.224), suggesting that the presence of lesions within the verbal memory network, rather than lesion volumes per se, plays a more substantial role in explaining the observed verbal memory declines. Second, we explored whether the other seven personalized networks could also account for the verbal memory declines. However, no significant correlation was observed between the lesion volume ratio of these personalized networks and the extent of verbal memory decline (Figure\u00a0 ; all   p  's\u2009>\u2009.05), indicating the functional specificity of the personalized DMN in representing verbal memory function. Finally, we assessed the impact of hippocampal lesions on verbal memory declines. The analysis revealed that 50.0% (5\/10) of patients without hippocampal lesions, and 50.0% (9\/18) of patients with hippocampal lesions experienced clinically meaningful post\u2010operative decline in verbal memory, suggestive of a limited influence of hippocampal lesions on verbal memory declines in our samples (Fisher's exact test, two tailed,   p  \u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nVerbal memory decline is a major postoperative complication following temporal lobe surgeries (Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). While the temporal lobe is widely recognized as a core node for verbal memory, extra\u2010temporal areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex, angular gyrus, as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, also play crucial roles in this cognitive function (Savage et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ; Sidhu et al.,\u00a0 ). These temporal and extra\u2010temporal areas are together organized into a distributed functional network across the whole brain. In the study, we found the distributed functional network is or at least is a part of the DMN. In line with previous studies, the DMN is activated during the verbal memory task performance (Andreasen et al.,\u00a0 ) and its functional and anatomical impairments are associated with verbal memory declines in aging, stroke, and mild cognitive impairment (Huo et al.,\u00a0 ; Park et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ). The distributed functional network in verbal memory processing is further supported by the selective impairments of verbal memory in six cases whose surgical lesions were located outside of the temporal lobe but in the verbal memory network. \n\nHigher\u2010order association networks, such as the language, memory, and executive control networks, show substantial inter\u2010individual functional variability in healthy populations (Mueller et al.,\u00a0 ). The findings of the study reveal a pronounced degree of variability in the verbal memory network, particularly in the temporal lobe, with minimal overlapping probability observed across different patients. This noteworthy variability highlights the critical importance of employing personalized functional margin mapping techniques to better understand and accommodate individual differences. In addition, the personalized functional organization of the human brain is not solely explained by anatomical substrates (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Nenning et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, surgical guidelines based only on anatomical landmarks may not be sufficient to prevent postoperative functional declines. In contrast, our personalized functional mapping technique demonstrates high predictive accuracy, and the lesioned ratios show a modest correlation with post\u2010operative declines in verbal memory. These results indicate that our personalized mapping approach effectively captures the functional margins for each individual and accounts for individual differences in a reliable and precise manner. \n\nIntraoperative functional mapping of eloquent cortices through direct electrical stimulation has become a standard clinical practice for identifying motor and language areas (Chang et al.,\u00a0 ; Ojemann et al.,\u00a0 ; Usui et al.,\u00a0 ). However, mapping memory\u2010related areas poses challenges due to their less clearly locatable nature. Our proposed personalized verbal memory mapping represents a promising approach for evaluating the potential impact of different resection boundaries on verbal memory function, thereby enhancing precision in presurgical planning. Moreover, our methods could be naturally generalized to other patients with epilepsy and brain tumors whose lesions involve verbal memory networks, as our method focuses on functional network rather than specific diseases. The versatility of our method also allows for its application in studying various other functional networks, including language, attention, and executive control networks. As a result, this method holds significant potential for broader applicability in presurgical planning and provides neurosurgeons with valuable tools to make well\u2010informed decisions, minimize surgical risks, and ultimately improve surgical outcomes. \n\nThe current study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, although we proposed a distributed functional network playing a crucial role in verbal memory processing and achieved a high predictive accuracy, we only included eight cases with extra\u2010temporal lesions, which may limit the generalizability of the claim that extra\u2010temporal areas contribute to verbal memory. Moreover, the relatively high observed prevalence of functional impairments among the subgroup (6\/8) may partially resulting from a sampling bias that favored the inclusion of patients with substantial lesion sizes. This bias may have contributed to an increased likelihood of lesion overlap with the functional network. Thus, further validating the frontal and parietal regions of the verbal memory network would be valuable in a larger cohort with more heterogeneous lesion locations. Second, the present study collected post\u2010operative data within 1\u20132\u2009weeks after surgery, with the absence of long\u2010term (>3\u2009months) data, as seen in previous clinical studies. The choice of follow\u2010up timepoint aligns with our primary aim, which is to validate the accuracy of personalized functional mapping using surgical lesions rather than to identify predictors for post\u2010operative prognostics, particularly in cases of functional impairments that are difficult to compensate for. Our primary aim prioritizes the immediate impact of surgical lesions and intentionally minimizes the impact of post\u2010operative functional reorganization and compensatory processes. These processes often undergo rapid development within the initial 6\u2009months post\u2010surgery, as well documented in studies related to post\u2010stroke functional rehabilitation (Boes et al.,\u00a0 ; Elger et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we acknowledge the significant value of long\u2010term follow\u2010up data, which can substantially enrich our understanding of functional reorganization processes. Such long\u2010term data will be particularly important for distinguishing brain areas at different risk degrees and further enhancing surgical planning, which are critical clinical considerations for post\u2010operative quality of life. Future research in this direction holds promise for advancing our insights into post\u2010operative outcomes and functional recovery. Third, the assessment of verbal memory relied solely on the AVLT, which primarily measures verbal item memory. Another commonly used assessment in the field is verbal associative memory (Busch et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ), which also predominantly activates the left hemisphere. However, these two tasks may recruit different neural substrates (Eichenbaum et al.,\u00a0 ). For instance, the hippocampus appears to be more engaged during associative memory tasks (Binder,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). This could potentially explain the lack of impairment in verbal item memory due to hippocampal damage. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nHere, we mapped a PVMN for each patient before surgery. The accuracy of the personalized network mapping was validated through neurosurgeries, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity and outperforming the group\u2010level atlas. Moreover, our findings showed that extent of lesion involvement within the personalized network serves as an accurate predictor for post\u2010operative declines in verbal memory. Overall, the delineation of a PVMN holds promise as a valuable tool in presurgical planning and prognostic prediction, contributing to the preservation of critical functional abilities. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nH.

Here, the authors determined the neurocomputational mechanisms engaged in adapting to fluctuating intentions of others over repeated social interactions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDuring social interactions, humans are often uncertain whether others intend to compete or cooperate. The intentions of other agents can fluctuate over time, making it challenging to develop successful behavioral strategies. A key question is how the brain decides whether the other is cooperating or competing during volatile situations in which the nature of the social interactions is not explicitly determined, as when others interact to achieve a common goal while maximizing their own benefits. This question is of importance since it lies at the heart of strategic social decision making . In these types of situations, other agents can change behavior according to cooperative or competitive intentions. \n\nCooperation is generally defined as involving a group of individuals working together to attain a common goal . In contrast, competition involves one person attempting to outperform another in a zero-sum situation . A number of theoretical accounts and experimental results demonstrate that the ability to mentalize, i.e. to simulate the other\u2019s belief about one\u2019s next course of action, is crucial for strategically sophisticated agents . The neurocomputational mechanisms engaged in attributing intentions to others have been studied in situations in which participants are explicitly informed about the nature of the interactions, either in a collaborative context alone  or in a competitive context alone . For example, during a cooperative game such as the coordination game, one of the best strategies is to try to choose one of two presented targets consistently. In contrast, in a competitive game such as the matching pennies game , the optimal strategy is to choose between two targets equally often and randomly across trials. If the identity of the game played is not known, the agent has to adjust his\/her strategy based on repeated interactions with others and to infer cooperation\/competition on the basis of observations. How the brain achieves such inference poses a unique computational problem because it not only requires the recursive representation of reciprocal beliefs about other\u2019s intentions, as in cooperative or competitive contexts alone, but it also requires one to decide whether the other is competing or cooperating to deploy an appropriate behavioral strategy. \n\nHere, we sought to determine the neurocomputational mechanisms that underlie the inferences of whether a person is competing or cooperating during volatile situations in which the nature of the interactions is not explicitly signaled. A recent computational account proposed that arbitration between strategies is determined by their predictive reliability, such that control over behavior is adaptively weighted toward the strategy with the most reliable prediction . This approach has been tested successfully in the domains of instrumental or Pavlovian action selection , model-based and model-free learning  and learning by imitation or emulation . Extending this concept of a mixture of experts to social interactions, we investigated whether the brain relies on distinct experts to compute the best choice between two possible intentions attributed to others (cooperation or competition) and then weights them by their relative reliability. We tested and compared these mixtures of models, that attribute intentions to others dynamically, with different classes of learning models: non-Bayesian vs Bayesian and non-mentalizing vs mentalizing (see Table\u00a0 ). This allowed us to identify the algorithms and brain mechanisms engaged with a key component of estimating other\u2019s intentions, i.e., whether the social partner was cooperating or competing.   \nClassification of models according to 3 categories \n  \nThe first column\u00a0indicates the ability of the model to mentalize, the second represents whether the model is a Bayesian model, and the third concerns models that could be used with a mixture of experts. \n  \n\nThe majority of theoretical frameworks used to model feedback-dependent changes in decision making strategies, such as choice reinforcement and related Markov Decision Process (MDP) models, assume that optimal decisions can be determined from the observable events and variables by the decision makers. Clearly, these assumptions do not capture the reality and complexity of human social interactions because observable behaviors of other individuals provide only very partial information about their likely future behaviors. Moreover, model-free RL algorithms assume that values (utility or desirability of states and actions), change incrementally across trials according to the choice outcomes. This assumption is invalid when option values change abruptly, such as when the intention of the other shifts between cooperation and competition. These limitations explain why agents basing their behavior only on standard RL models can be exploited by opponents using more sophisticated algorithms . \n\nA more accurate account of strategic learning is based on a family of RL models which adds a mathematical term to the classical Temporal Difference (TD) algorithm to consider the other as an agent having their own policy, which can be influenced by oneself . For example, fictitious play learning proposes a basic form of mentalizing by having a representation of the other\u2019s strategy. Influence models also consider that RL can be supplemented by a mentalizing term that represents how our actions influence those of others, updated through a belief prediction error . Such influence models formalize not only how players react to others\u2019 past choices, (first-order beliefs in Theory of Mind: ToM), but also how they anticipate the influence of their own choices on the others\u2019 behavior, (i.e., mentalizing-related second-order beliefs). Another modeling approach of theory of mind uses Bayesian algorithms to model inferences about the future actions of another by attempting to take their point of view and to simulate their decision . This strategy can be performed recursively so that participants make inferences concerning the others\u2019 inferences and so on. Such a sophisticated approach could be grounded in the theoretical framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) . POMDPs provide a probabilistic framework for solving tasks involving action selection and decision making under uncertainty . Notably, this approach has recently been applied to strategic cooperation in groups . These models, however, have mainly been limited to signaled cooperative or competitive tasks in which the intentions of players do not change over a given period . \n\nHere, we tested the predictions of these different families of learning models against one another, investigating not only non-Bayesian vs Bayesian models and non-mentalizing vs mentalizing models, but also a mixture of models deploying an arbitration process whereby the influence of attributing intentions to others is dynamically modulated, depending on which type of intention (i.e. cooperative vs competitive) is most suitable to guide behavior at a given time. For the mixture of models, two expert systems implement an identical influence learning process, working together to make strategic decisions. These two experts differ only by their priors, one expert assessing competitive intentions and the other assessing cooperative intentions, while a controller weight between these experts according to their relative reliabilities. Each expert system uses a classic RL algorithm complemented with a mentalizing term to infer the other\u2019s actions. This hypothesis extends the mixture of models to a more general view in which the experts are differentiated not by their cognitive processes, such as model based vs. model-free learning or emulation vs. imitation , but by their priors. \n\nTo determine the neurocomputational mechanisms that underlie the inferences of whether a person is competing or cooperating during volatile situations in which the nature of the interactions is not explicitly signaled, we used a novel model-based fMRI design (Fig.\u00a0 ). We used an iterative dyadic game in which participants were told that they would interact with another person via a computer. Unbeknownst to them, the other player was an artificial agent that switched between blocks of cooperative trials and blocks of competitive trials when playing a card matching game. Thus, the opponent algorithm\u2019s goals were the same as those of participants in the Cooperative blocks but were opposite in Competitive blocks. Participants remained uncertain with respect to the goals of their \u201cpartner\u201d or \u201copponent\u201d, which alternated, without this being signaled. This task allowed us to investigate the algorithms used by the brain to recognize the \u201cintentions\u201d of others and to adopt appropriate strategies when the modes of interaction (cooperation vs competition) are not indicated.    fMRI experiment.  \n a   After a fixation cross, four cards were presented on the screen. The two cards shown on top of the screen represent the cards presented to the opponent\/partner (i.e., Artificial Agent), and not seen by the participant while the two kings (one black and one red) are the cards presented to the participant (shown in the bottom of the screen). The participants had to choose between these two cards. At the time of the decision, the upper screen represents the display if the AA makes its choice first, while the lower screen shows how one card is highlighted with yellow border if the participant makes his choice first. Then a screen presents the participant\u2019s and Artificial Agent\u2019s choices together. Finally, at the time of outcome the participant wins if both he\/she chooses the same card as the AA (here red king).   b   Payoff matrix of the two types of block. Participant\u2019s payoff (bottom left of each small square) and the Artificial Agent payoff (top right of each small square).   c   Frequency of winning (black line) during Competitive (red background) and Cooperative (green background) blocks. The gray area represents the 95% confidence interval. The orange background represents 5 initial trials in which the AA was played randomly for initialization purposes. \n  \n\nWe show that a mixture of influence models best accounted for the behavior in our task, referred to as the mixed-intentions influence model. This Mixed-intentions influence model accounts for observed behavior in which the other\u2019s goal is often only partially congruent with one\u2019s own, allowing us to explain a continuous range of behavior between pure cooperation and pure competition. At the brain system level, we show that computational signals (decision value, prediction error) from the two experts engage similar brain regions, due to the fact that these experts implement an identical influence learning process, each using different priors. Moreover, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the ventral striatum track the reliability difference signal from the controller. When comparing trials classified as competitive versus cooperative by the controller, activity correlates positively with the reward prediction error (PE) signal more in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the intra-parietal sulcus (IPS). In addition, when participants expect higher utility for choosing according to competitive rather than cooperative strategies, the vmPFC and the ventral striatum track the intentions of others and show changes in functional connectivity with the same brain system which discriminates reward PE between believed modes of interaction. Together, these results provide a model-based account of the neurocomputational mechanisms guiding human strategic decisions during games in which the intentions of others fluctuate between cooperation and competition. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral signature of tracking intentions \n  \nIn the Mixed-intentions task, participants were led to believe that they were interacting with another participant, in fact, they were interacting with an artificial agent (AA). Participants were asked to choose one of two cards to match the other participant\u2019s choice. Unbeknownst to the participant, the AA tried to match the two cards (coordination game) or to mismatch them (matching pennies game). To assess the degree of participant\u2019s cooperation, we used their probability of staying on the same target as the previous trial. Indeed, there is one unique Nash equilibrium for the matching pennies which is to randomly switch target half the time, whereas less than 50% of switch signal cooperation. We assessed how participants used the history of previous interactions to make their choices to switch target. We used logistic regression to examine whether participants selected the same target as that from the previous trial (\u201cStay\u201d) or chose the other target (\u201cSwitch\u201d), depending on whether the previous three trials (at t-1, t-2 and t-3) had been won or lost, whether the previous decisions had been to Stay or Switch, and whether the previous interactions from those trials indicated cooperation (Eq.\u00a0 ). We also added sex, age and the rank of each trial (first, second or third trial etc. i.e., time indicator) as control variables. All trials except the first 5 trials were included in this analysis. Cooperation was defined as the binomial variable representing the interaction between the last action of the Artificial Agent (AA) and the participant\u2019s own previous outcome (\u201dCooperativity signature of AA\u201d). This variable was set to 1 if either the participant had won on the previous trial and the AA stayed on the same target in the next trial, or if the participant lost on the previous trial and the AA switched to the other target in the next trial. Otherwise, the variable was set to 0. Indeed, if the AA is a cooperative partner, both players should choose to keep the same target after winning to be more predictable. Note that this definition needs to be distinguished from the degree of participant\u2019s cooperativity as defined by its probability to stay on the same target than on the previous trial. No multicollinearity was found between the regressors. \n\nWe found that the \u201cCooperativity signature of AA\u201d predicted an increase in the \u201cstay\u201d probability of participants at t-1 and t-2 ( , p\u2009=\u20090.021, CI[0.01; 0.09];  ,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002, CI[0.02; 0.08]; Fig.\u00a0 ). This suggests the participants tracked whether the other agent was cooperating during the two previous trials (but not before). Participants used the outcome of the latest trial to make the next decision (staying or switching target) according to a win\/stay, lose\/switch strategy ( ,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, CI[0.09; 0.24]; Fig.\u00a0 ). The lack of effect of the Cooperativity signature of AA at t-3 cannot be due to correlation with the regressors at t-1 or t-2, since a logistic regression model including only the regressors at t-3 (Previous winning interaction(t-3) (i.e. the boolean outcome of the previous interaction, 1 if it was a win, 0 if it was a loss), Switch(t-3), Cooperativity signature of AA(t-3)), showed that there was only an effect of Switch at (t-3) and not Previous winning interaction(t-3) and Cooperativity signature of AA(t-3). Additional behavioral data analyses showing evidence for separate cooperative and competitive experts are shown in Supplementary Note\u00a0  and Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 - .    Model-free behavioral analysis and models\u2019 comparison using Bayesian model selection.  \n a   Model-free analysis.

Bars represent the marginal effect in the percentage of each explicative variable on the probability to stay and the error bars represent the 95% confidence interval. *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 of a one-sided  , not corrected for multiple comparison. (  n  \u2009=\u200931 independent participants each making 158 time-dependent decisions). Concerning the Cooperativity Signature effect at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the respective   p   values were   p  \u2009=\u20090.20,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002 and   p  \u2009=\u20090.101. Similarly, for the previous winning interaction at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the respective p values were   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.225, and   p  \u2009=\u20090.200. Finally, for the previous participant switch at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the respective p values were   p  \u2009=\u20090.137,   p  \u2009=\u20090.057, and   p  \u2009=\u20090.016.   b   Model comparisons based on Bayesian model selection. The protected exceedance probabilities indicate that the Mixed-intentions Influence model (Inf 2 expert) explains decisions in the mixed intention task better than others: Bayesian Sequence Learner (BSL), Heuristic models: Random Bias (RB), Win\/Stay-Lose\/Switch (WSLS), Reinforcement Learning (RL), influence model competitive, influence model cooperative, 1-ToM competitive, 1-ToM cooperative, 1-ToM 2 experts. \n  \n\n\n### Computational models tracking intentions of the other agent \n  \nTo elucidate the computations underlying strategic decision making, we compared the results of different computational models. These models were split into five classes (see Supp. Methods). The first class of models were based on heuristics and included Win-Stay\/Lose-Switch and Random Bias models. The other four classes of algorithms can be classified into non-Bayesian versus Bayesian model families in one dimension and mentalizing versus non-mentalizing model families in the other dimension. Thus, the second class of models includes non-Bayesian, non-mentalizing models represented by reinforcement learning (RL) models. The third class represents non-Bayesian mentalizing models, namely the \u201cinfluence models\u201d which are RL models with an additional term representing how the actions of one player influence those of the other player. The fourth type corresponds to Bayesian non-mentalizing models, exemplified by the   k-  Bayesian Sequence Learner which tracks the probability that one target will be selected by the AA after a history of specific length   k  . The fifth class of models contains Bayesian mentalizing models, which are the   k  -ToM models using recursive Bayesian inferences of depth   k   to predict the future choice of the AA. Each mentalizing model was tested using 3 versions: a competitive, a cooperative and a \u2018mixed intentions\u2019 version. The \u2018mixed intentions\u2019 version computes two separate decision values according to competitive and cooperative experts, respectively, and arbitrates between them based on the difference in their respective reliability (see Fig.\u00a0  and Supp. Methods). The two experts are running in parallel and there is no need for payoff matrices to be learnt. Indeed, they are hard coded in each expert and only the balance between the two experts has to be learned trial by trial. We defined reliability as the difference in unsigned value functions for two choices given by specific learning algorithms (See SI).    Schema of the mixed-intentions Influence model, model-free generative analysis, and predictive effect of the prediction error on the probability to stay on the same target.  \n a   Scheme of the Mixed-intentions Influence model. Two influence models (one cooperative \u2013 left, blue\u2013 and the other competitive \u2013 right, yellow) compute a value for choosing one specific target. A controller uses the difference between the absolute value of the value of each expert (called reliability) to compute a probability that the other is cooperating. Then, the model weights the value of each expert according to the probability of being in cooperative and in competitive modes to produce a final decision value. Then it compares its predictions to the actual reward and computes a new value for each expert.   b   Model-free generative analysis. We generated   n  \u2009=\u2009310 sets of independent data using a free parameter from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation calculated from the models fitted to the population, against the fixed sequences of choices that the artificial agent made against participants during the experiment. We regressed the behavioral decision to stay after selection of a specific target on the previous trial depending on the interaction of the previous outcome and the action of the artificial agent (\u201cCooperativity signature of AA\u201d), the success or failure of up to three previous trials, and the action to switch or stay of the participant. Bars represent the marginal effect in the percentage of each explicative variable on the probability of stay. The error bars are the 95% confidence interval (random-effect logistic regression,  ). For the cooperativity signature of the AA at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the   p  -values are respectively   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003 and p\u2009=\u20090.070. For the previous winning interaction at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the p-values are   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.649, and   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, respectively, and finally, for the previous participant switch at t-1, the p-value is p\u2009<\u20090.001.   c   Marginal effect (in percentage) of the prediction error at trial t-1 on the probability to stay (at trial t) on the same target in trials classified as cooperative (at trial t, green dots) and trials classified as competitive (at trial t, red dots) (e.g. for a -1 prediction error, the probability to stay in a trial classified as cooperative increases by 82%). Error bars are the 95% confidence interval. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001 (random-effect logistic regression). \n  \n\nNext, we performed a group-level random-effect Bayesian model selection on the free energy computed by the model\u2019s estimation, taking into account potential outliers and the number of free parameters . We found that the \u2018mixed intentions influence\u2019 model was most frequently the best fit across the population (pEP=0.98) (Fig.\u00a0 ), demonstrating that participants employed mentalizing-related computations in our mixed intentions task. This finding also indicates that arbitration between a cooperative and a competitive expert best explains observed participants\u2019 behavior, rather than either expert taken individually. To check the validity of the competitive\/cooperative behavioral signature, we performed two additional analyses and found that each signature could be recovered by its corresponding expert model, but not by the other (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). These analyses consisted of logistic panel data regressions, (one for the cooperative model alone and one for the competitive model alone), clustered by simulation on the \u201cStay\u201d strategy. To do this, we first generated a total of 310 datasets with the influence competitive model playing against the same sequences of AA\u2019s choices as the real players. To avoid contingencies between AA choices and model choices, we used the sequence of AA choices generated against real participants as a non-contingent opponent for the model which generates new data. We next generated data with the influence cooperative model using the same method. These logistic regression analyses included only a constant as predictor variable to directly compare the probability to stay independently of other variables, on behavior simulated by the competitive expert alone, or the cooperative expert alone. No multicollinearity was found between the regressors in the two analyses. \n\nThese two analyses showed that each expert is able to reproduce its corresponding behavioral signature. That is, the probability to stay on the same target of the competitive expert was 0.508 ( ,   p  \u2009=\u20090.116, CI[0.499; 0.518]), whereas against the same sequences of AA choices the cooperative expert stayed on the same target significantly more frequently with a probability of 0.521 ( ,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, CI[0.512; 0.530]). Thus, the cooperative expert cannot recover the competitive signature accurately and the competitive expert cannot recover the cooperative signature. \n\nAdditionally, only the Mixed-intentions Influence model (and not the cooperative or the competitive one) successfully reproduced the effect of the Cooperativity signature of AA on the probability to stay, as in the participants (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , and Supp. Note\u00a0 ). We conducted a logistic regression to understand how the Mixed-intentions Influence model explained differences in behavioral strategy to stay or switch target. This analysis included the reward prediction error at t-1, the valence of the arbitration between cooperative and competitive intentions at time t (sign(\u0394); 1 for cooperative and -1 for competitive), and the interaction between these two variables. No multicollinearity\u00a0was found between the regressors in this analysis. This analysis revealed a main effect of the valence (cooperative or competitive) of the arbitration (  Fig.  ) indicating that participants tended to stay more on the same target when they attributed cooperative intentions to the other. Moreover, when we tested how previous outcome might be used to make a decision according to the currently more reliable expert, we found an interaction effect, i.e. participants integrated the prediction error in their strategy differently depending on the attributed intention (  Fig.\u00a0 ). That is, large negative prediction errors increased the probability that the participant would stay on the same target when the controller attributed cooperative intentions compared to when it attributed competitive intentions. In addition, we also performed another logistic regression analysis using the same variables and the actual mode of interaction (i.e., Competitive block trials versus Cooperative block trials). Again, no multicollinearity was found between the regressors in this analysis. We did not find the same interaction effect when we compared actual Competitive and Cooperative block trials ( , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , see Supp. Note\u00a0 ), showing that the   classified   intentions, rather than Competitive vs. Cooperative blocks, affected the use of prediction error. Finally, we conducted supplementary analyses to check the robustness of our Mixed-intentions influence model (See Supp. Note\u00a0  and Parameter recovery matrix and confusion matrix in Supplementary Figs.\u00a0  and  ). \n\nWe reasoned that when facing an individual who can change his\/her intentions to compete or cooperate over time, the brain may implement distinct experts to compute the best choice based on these two possible intentions (i.e., cooperative or competitive) weighted by their relative reliabilities. We, therefore, built such an \u2018arbitrator\u2019 computation as a sigmoid function of the difference in reliability between the cooperative and competitive interactions (\u0394), with an added bias (\u03b4) that characterized each individual\u2019s tendency to attribute competitive (\u03b4\u2009>\u20090) or cooperative (\u03b4\u2009<\u20090) intentions to others. To assess the intentions of the other, participants only have access to the outcomes of previous interactions, the choice (to stay or switch) of the artificial agent in previous trials, and the interaction between these two types of information. \n\nWe hypothesized that repeated successes in a social context should favor the attribution of cooperative intentions because a series of victories suggests that both players are satisfied with the outcome. In such situations, the other player (i.e. AA) would become more predictable, which is an important feature to build cooperation . Moreover, the interaction between the outcome and the AA\u2019s choice (i.e., the tendency of the AA to \u201cstay\u201d after a participant wins or \u201cswitch\u201d after a participant loses) should drive the arbitrator to favor the cooperative mode, because playing the same winning target for both players corresponds to the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the Cooperative game. To test this hypothesis, we regressed the signed difference in reliability on (1) the participant\u2019s last outcome, (2) AA\u2019s choice to \u201cstay\u201d or to \u201cswitch\u201d and (3) the interaction between the participant\u2019s outcome and the AA\u2019s choice to stay or switch (Cooperativity signature of AA) for up to three retrospective trials. We found that the past two interactions between participant\u2019s outcome and AA\u2019s action (Cooperativity signature of AA), the last outcome, and switches by the AA at trial t-2 and t-3 explained the difference in reliability ( ;  \u2009=\u20091.99,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;  ,   =\u2009\u22120.097,   p  \u2009=\u20090.007), Fig.\u00a0 ). No multicollinearity was found between the regressors in this analysis.    Reliability difference from the controller as a function of behavioral signatures, predicted probability to cooperate computed by the model and BOLD signal correlating with the reliability difference of the Mixed-intentions Influence model.  \n a   Difference in reliability is influenced by the Cooperativity signature of the Artificial Agent (AA), specifically the interaction of the previous participant\u2019s outcome followed by the action of the artificial agent (Participant wins then AA stays and participant loses then AA switches), the latest outcome and the computer\u2019s switch at trial t-2 and t-3. Bars represent the marginal effect in percentage of each explicative variable on the probability to stay. Error bars are the 95% confidence interval. *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 of a  , not corrected for multiple comparison. (  n  \u2009=\u200931 independent participants each making 158 time-dependent decisions). Concerning the Cooperativity Signature effect at t-1, t-2, and t-3, the respective p values were   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.040, and   p  \u2009=\u20090.466. Similarly for the previous winning interaction at t-1, t-2, and t-3,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.962, and   p  \u2009=\u20090.094. Finally, for the previous participant switch at t-1, t-2, and t-3,   p  \u2009=\u20090.198,   p  \u2009=\u20090.078, and   p  \u2009=\u20090.007.   b   Mean probability of the participants attempting to cooperate across all participants (black line) for the 163 trials computed by the Mixed-intentions influence model. The initial orange area is the 5 random initializing trials, green areas are the Cooperative blocks and red areas are the Competitive blocks. The gray area is the 95% confidence interval.   c   BOLD signal in ventral striatum, mPFC, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is correlated with the difference in reliability, \u0394, of estimated competitive and cooperative intentions (  p   < 0.05 whole-brain family-wise error). \n  \n\nTogether, these analyses show that participants\u2019 behavior, when alternating between unsignaled cooperative and competitive blocks, is best explained by the Mixed-intentions Influence model. According to these findings, people use mentalization to update their beliefs about future chosen targets, and dynamically arbitrate between the predicted intentions of the other agent to compete or cooperate (Fig.\u00a0 ). Having characterized the computations of the dynamic adaptation to the changing intentions of others, we next tested where latent variables of these computations are encoded at the brain system level. \n\n\n### Model-based fMRI analyses \n  \nFirst, we investigated whether\u00a0the brain systems engaged by the two experts were similar regarding the decision value (DV) and reward prediction error (PE) of each expert. To do this, for the mixed-intention influence model, we built a GLM (GLM0) including, at the first level, decision values (DV) from the competitive expert, decision value from the cooperative expert, PE from the competitive expert and PE from the cooperative expert. Specifically, there were 4 onsets including the time of the cue presentation (cards on screen), participant\u2019s button press, AA\u2019s choice and feedback time. At the time of the cue onset, the parametric regressors were the DV for staying on the same target generated by the competitive expert, and the DV for staying on the same target generated by the cooperative expert. Similarly, at the time of feedback, the regressors were the PE generated by the competitive expert and the PE generated by the cooperative expert. We performed an ANOVA including DV and PE of each expert. Activity in the ventral striatum for the DV of staying on the same target was commonly observed for the two experts (P\u2009=\u20090.007 Family-Wise Error cluster corrected, initial cluster forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). When directly comparing the DV of the two experts, we did not find any separate brain region (  P  \u2009>\u20090.95 FWE cluster corrected, initial cluster forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). For the reward prediction error (PE), the two experts showed common activity in the ventral putamen (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001), the anterior medial PFC (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001), posterior cingulate cortex (  p  \u2009=\u20090.035 and the lateral OFC (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ) (all Ps are FWE cluster corrected, initial cluster forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). \n\nNext, we constructed a GLM (GLM1) to identify brain regions tracking the arbitration process (i.e., \u0394: signed reliability difference, reliability for cooperation minus that of competition) between the two experts (one for cooperation, the other for competition). We added the reliability difference \u0394 as parametric regressor at the decision stage, as well as the previous winning interaction (i.e. the boolean outcome of the previous interaction, 1 if it was a win, 0 if it was a loss), the previous switch and Cooperativity signature of AA of the previous trial, as non-orthogonalized parametric regressors to allow them to compete for the variance. At the outcome phase, we added the reward prediction error as a parametric regressor and controlled for the effect of the other\u2019s intention by adding \u0394 as a non-orthogonalized regressor. The bilateral ventral striatum (x,y,z\u2009=\u200914,12,\u22122,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and x,y,z\u2009=\u2009\u221213,7,\u22126,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001), and vmPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u20096,46,\u22126,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001) tracked the difference in reliability between experts (\u0394) at the decision time (all Ps are FWE cluster corrected, initial cluster forming threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ), and this cannot be explained by the previous outcome alone or Cooperativity signature of AA. Bilateral dorsal striatum (DS; x,y,z\u2009=\u200917,6,\u221212,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and \u221214,3,\u221211,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; x,y,z\u2009=\u200944,36,\u221214,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003 and \u221244 52 8,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; x,y,z\u2009=\u20092,\u221235,38,   P  \u2009=\u20090.010), and bilateral angular gyrus (x,y,z\u2009=\u200945,\u221230,47,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and \u221254,\u221262,39.   P  \u2009=\u20090.005) encoded the reward prediction error at the outcome time (all Ps are FWE cluster corrected, initial cluster forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ).    Common regions for competitive and cooperative Prediction Error and brain system encoding Prediction Error more in competitive versus cooperative classified trials.  \n a   Brain regions in which BOLD signal correlates with prediction errors for trials classified by the controller to be either competitive or cooperative.   b   Brain regions in which BOLD activity correlates more with PE on trials estimated to be competitive compared to trials estimated to be cooperative. This network comprised dlPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u200930,9,42), IPS (x,y,z\u2009=\u200950,\u221250,32) and the rTPJ (x,y,z\u2009=\u200951,\u221250,33,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 whole-brain family-wise error).   c   Beta value of PE correlation extracted at the outcome of trials estimated to be either competitive or cooperative. Left: regions in the ventral striatum (left x,y,z\u2009=\u2009\u221214,3,\u221211 + right x,y,z\u2009=\u200917,6,\u221212), and rACC (x,y,z\u2009=\u20096,42,\u22123) with increased correlation with PE in trials estimated to be either competitive or cooperative. Right: specific brain regions correlating with PE when trials were classified as competitive as compared to cooperative: dlPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u200930,9,42), IPS (x,y,z\u2009=\u200942,\u221247,42) and rTPJ (x,y,z\u2009=\u200951,\u221250,33) from 8\u2009mm spheres centered on peak activation.   N  \u2009=\u200931 independent participants each making 158 dependent decisions. Black box plots represent the interquartile range (bold line), and the range of the data with center = median and whiskers = the most extreme data point that does not exceed 1.5 interquartile range. The colored shapes (red or green violin plots for trials classified as competitive or cooperative, respectively) represent the kernel probability density of the data. \n  \n\nTo identify the brain areas encoding the reward prediction error more robustly when the competitive expert was deemed more reliable than the cooperative one, we tested another GLM (GLM2). Trial onsets were separated according to whether the value of the signed reliability difference \u0394 was positive or negative. If this value was positive, the trial was classified as cooperative, and competitive otherwise. The computed decision value for staying on the same target was used as a parametric regressor at the time of choice and the reward prediction error computed by the Mixed-intentions influence model was used as parametric regressor at the time of outcome. We found that the right dlPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u200935,11,36,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003), the IPS region (x,y,z\u2009=\u200950, \u221250, 32,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ; x,y,z\u2009=\u200951,\u221250,33,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001 FWE cluster corrected) more stongly encoded reward prediction error in trials classified as competitive versus cooperative (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE, Fig.\u00a0 b, c and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). This effect could not be explained by smaller variance in the PE regressor in trials classified as competitive trials compared to those classified as cooperative, since we observed no difference in regressor variance on these two types of trials (  p  \u2009=\u20090.57, Levene\u2019s test). No areas showed stronger PE signals during the trials classified as cooperative compared to competitive. It should be noted that this differential PE coding reflects the classification of the current trial as cooperative vs. competitive (fMRI results, Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, the behavioral results in Fig.\u00a0  show that the effect of rPE on behavior depends on how the next trial might be classified. \n\n\n### Connectivity analysis \n  \nFinally, we performed a generalized psycho-physiological interaction (gPPI) seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis to understand the interactions between brain regions tracking the arbitration process (i.e. \u0394: reliability difference) for the cooperative and competitive experts and those regions more engaged with the PE when the controller attributes competitive rather than cooperative intentions to the AA (see Methods). We used the ventral striatum and vmPFC, which encoded the controller, as a combined ROI, as the seed regions (ROI extracted from the GLM1 striatal and vmPFC activity) for trials classified as competitive compared to those classified as cooperative (i.e. trials for \u0394\u2009<\u20090 or \u0394\u2009>\u20090) at the decision time. We found stronger effective connectivity between regions encoding the difference in reliability and the right dlPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u200938,34,34), the left IPS region (x,y,z\u2009=\u2009\u221248;\u221244;58) and the left TPJ (x,y,z\u2009=\u2009\u221242,\u221240,50,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE; Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ) at the decision time for trials classified as competitive compared to those classified as cooperative. This result indicates that the dlPFC, IPS and left TPJ receive an input signal at the time of choice according to the difference in reliability with respect to the anticipated competitive versus cooperative intention of others. This brain network largely overlaps with the brain network differentiating PE encoding between trials classified as competitive versus cooperative at the outcome (Fig.\u00a0 ). This difference in connectivity could not be due to a general higher coupling during classified competitive trials compared to classified cooperative trials. Indeed, we tested for a difference in global efficiency between classified competitive and classified cooperative trials using graph theory and found no differences between the two modes of interaction (Global efficiency: T(26)\u2009=\u20090.75;  \u2009= 0.46). Moreover, we also tested for differences between modes of interaction (competitive and cooperative) in local efficiency, and found that no node exhibited different local efficiency between trials classified as competitive and those classified as cooperative.    Higher functional coupling during trials classified as competitive compared to those classified as cooperative, between \u2018reliability difference\u2019 brain regions (mPFC and ventral striatum) from the controller and regions encoding more the prediction error in these classified trials.  \nFor the connectivity analysis, the BOLD signal was extracted from seed regions (mPFC and ventral striatum using GLM1) computing the reliability difference between cooperative and competitive intentions of others (in Blue). The psychophysiological interaction effect shows higher functional coupling (voxels in red) with the left TPJ (x,y,z\u2009=\u2009\u221242,\u221240,50), left IPS (x,y,z\u2009=\u2009-48;\u221244;58) and right dlPFC (x,y,z\u2009=\u200938, 34, 34,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE threshold at   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) in trials classified as competitive as compared to those classified as cooperative. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo make a strategic decision when facing an individual with unknown and fluctuating intentions, it is necessary to make inferences as to whether we are in a competitive or cooperative situation. In the context of minimal information, for example when only the past choices of the other are available, but not their outcomes, such inferences are much more difficult than when the other\u2019s intention is known (e.g., in a competitive game) . Here, we provide evidence that the brain engages in dynamic tracking of another individual\u2019s intentions, despite having no explicit information regarding whether the situation is cooperative or competitive. We found that strategies of participants were mostly affected by the outcomes of previous interactions and by a \u201csignature\u201d of the other\u2019s cooperativity, i.e., the tendency of the other (here the Artificial Agent, AA) to stay on the same target after the participant wins. Comparison between computational models demonstrated that such behavior is best explained by a model in which choice is driven by a controller that tracks the reliability difference between cooperative and competitive intentions. The fMRI results show that the neural computations of this controller are implemented in the ventral striatum and the vmPFC. Thus, both behavior and brain imaging results can be accounted for by a model that includes a controller that allocates weights according to different experts\u2019 predictions. At the time of outcome, a brain network, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), ventral striatum and lateral OFC encoded prediction error similarly in trials classified as competitive or cooperative. However, prediction error signals in some brain areas depended on the classification of the current trial as cooperative or competitive as classified by the controller. That is, a distinct brain network, composed of the bilateral dlPFC, bilateral IPS regions and the rTPJ was more engaged for trials classified as competitive compared to those classified as cooperative. This latter brain network reflects a differential use of the outcome of the social interaction as a function of whether it is classified as competitive or cooperative (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nMentalizing processes are essential to correctly infer the strategy of others. This is true in the Cooperative context, in which participants performed above chance, reflecting their ability to effectively infer the other\u2019s (i.e., AA\u2019s) behavior. In the Competitive context, participants performed below the chance level, showing that the AA was able to predict their behavior and exploit their previous choices\/outcomes. The Mixed-intentions Influence model was most consistent with the data and generated behavior similar to that of the participants. Each expert model is an expanded RL model, with a term accounting for one\u2019s previous choice influencing the choice of the other. Although only the influence term differed between the competitive and cooperative models, the Mixed-intentions Influence model tracked intentions based on this second-order mentalizing term by weighting the contribution of cooperative and competitive experts. One key aspect of this Mixed-intentions Influence model is that it captures higher order structures (fluctuations between cooperation and competition) during social interactions. In contrast, an important limitation of the classical RL model is that it does not exploit higher-order structures such as interdependencies between different stimuli, actions, and subsequent rewards. Previous studies demonstrated that models incorporating such structures can account for individual decision making in different situations . Here, we showed that the representation of abstract states, such as whether the other is cooperating or competing, can be extended to social decisions and underlies the ability to build strategies. To confirm that the Mixed-intentions Influence model accounted more for neural activity in brain areas involved in social interactions, we formally compared the brain regions covarying more with the decision value for staying on the same target, as computed by the winning model, compared to the decision value for staying on the same target, computed by a simple RL model (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). One crucial difference between a simple RL model and the Mixed-intentions Influence model is that in the former, only the value of the chosen option is updated and the valuation of the option that was not chosen does not change. In the latter, both the values of the chosen and unchosen options are updated to incorporate the knowledge that the current state has a given reliability to be cooperative or competitive. The controller weights the valuation produced according to the competitive or cooperative hypothesis using a sigmoid function of the difference in reliability between the two experts. \n\nActivity in the ventral striatum and vmPFC increased as the prediction of cooperation from the controller became more reliable than the competitive prediction. These brain regions dynamically track the difference in reliability between intentions classified as cooperative and competitive in a situation when the nature of the social interactions is unknown. Previous reports demonstrated a role of the ventral striatum when making cooperative choices alone, in response to a partner\u2019s cooperative choice in an explicit cooperation task  and also in the attribution of intentions in a competitive context . Our findings show that strategic social behavior can be explained by a Controller (i.e. mixture of experts) according to which cooperative\/competitive social behavior results from the interaction of multiple systems, each proposing possible strategies for action . The ventral striatum was involved in computing both the reliability difference between the competitive and cooperative experts at the time of choice (Fig.\u00a0 ) and the prediction error at the outcome (Fig.\u00a0 ). This ventral striatum engagement could reflect that it anticipates more social victories at the time of choice, when one is more likely to be in a cooperative rather than a competitive context, and that it also encodes unexpected social victories. These findings indicate that the reliability difference and the PE signals are both used to adapt to fluctuating intentions of others during different interactional contexts (Fig.\u00a0 ). This is consistent with previous studies reporting that the ventral striatum is engaged with mutual cooperation  and with the fact that this region is reliably active in relation to others\u2019 rewards and contains cells that link own rewards to self or others\u2019 actions . \n\nOne strength of our computational approach was to assess and compare a large variety of competing models, including Bayesian Sequence learners, Reinforcement Learning, Heuristic models, recursive learning model 1-TOM, influence models for only cooperative strategies or competitive strategies and a mixture of experts either using influence models (Mixed-intentions influence model) or using 1-ToM (1-ToM mixed intentions). Many have never previously been directly tested against each other. Other models (active inference, fictitious learning and Hierarchical Gaussian Filter) were also tested but did not pass the model recovery analyses, and are only reported in the Supp. Methods for completeness. Our results agree with studies concluding that social learning may be driven by reinforcement processes that include a mentalizing term . We demonstrate that when a task is not explicitly signaled as cooperative or competitive, this evokes the arbitration between strategies determined by predictive reliability. Behavior is hence controlled by giving a higher weight to the strategy with the most reliable prediction . Note that in our setting the only information that can be integrated by participants is their own choices, rewards and the history of the choices made by the other (i.e., AA). The structure of the task was not directly observable because the nature of the social interaction (i.e cooperative or competitive) was never explicitly signaled to participants, and the rewards of the other were not observed. The resulting complexity and uncertainty might reduce the benefit of model-based strategies, as suggested recently , and might increase the use of simpler trial and error learning. This contrasts with previous neuroimaging studies that investigated learning of social interactions in either competitive or cooperative situations alone (matching pennies or rock-paper-scissors games against computerized opponents) . Our findings also broadly agree with a cognitive hierarchy of strategic learning mechanisms, proposing that distinct levels of strategic thinking correspond to different levels of sophistication of learning mechanisms . However, we propose a more general model based on a mixture of influence learning experts that function in parallel and are then compared with respect to their relative reliability. \n\nCompetitive social interactions often emerge in situations where an agent\u2019s outcome depends on the choices of others, which requires the ability to infer the intentions of others . In the context of our mixed intentions task, when participants make a choice driven by the competitive expert, which is more reliable than the cooperative expert, the PE signal is more robustly encoded in the dlPFC and rTPJ\/IPS. Thus, priors on the context of interaction (competitive or cooperative) during the decision time, modulate the way the reward prediction error will be implemented at the time of outcome. Although this brain network has previously been reported when inferring the intentions of others , the strength of our computational account of theory of mind processes is to specify that this brain system computes a PE differently for trials that the controller classifies as competitive versus cooperative. This reflects a differentiation of PE signals in the implementation and use of the outcome of the social interaction, as a function of the classified interaction (Fig.\u00a0 ). Nevertheless, this finding does not indicate that each expert is encoded in separate brain regions. Indeed, computational signals (decision value and PE) from the two experts engaged common brain regions (see results and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The fact that we did not observe that each expert is encoded in separate brain regions may be seen as a limitation, since the behavioral model assumes two \u2018experts\u2019 learning in parallel. However, the algorithmic and the brain system levels have to be distinguished . Separate expert systems can be observed at the behavioral and computational levels for cooperation and competition, but it does not necessarily follow that separate brain systems must be assumed for these experts. Indeed, the two experts, each using different priors, implement the same cognitive process (i.e., influence learning). This is a different situation than previous mixture of models theories which weigh experts implementing different cognitive processes . This is a key conceptual distinction which extends the mixture of models to a more general view in which the experts are differentiated not by their cognitive processes but by their priors. \n\nIt should be noted that PE was not more volatile in trials when the competitive expert was more reliable than the cooperative expert. This rules out the possibility that the observed difference in PE encoding reflects higher PE volatility in competitive contexts. When comparing intentions classified as cooperative compared to competitive, participants tended to be more predictable, staying more on the same target after experiencing an unexpected social defeat (i.e., after higher negative PE) (Fig.\u00a0 ). This behavior likely reflects a signal sent to the other to indicate one\u2019s willingness to stay on the same target, despite bearing the potential cost of staying on this target . This is a key feature of successful coordination  in which agents who want to trigger reciprocity  are willing to incur a cost to promote cooperation from the other. \n\nFinally, we found higher effective connectivity between seed regions encoding the reliability difference of the controller (vmPFC and striatum) and brain regions more engaged in PE for trials classified as competitive versus cooperative (dlPFC, TPJ) (Fig.\u00a0 ). This indicates that brain regions engaged in the input of the arbitration process at the time of choice are more strongly coupled (respectively decoupled) with brain regions encoding PE for intentions classified as competitive (respectively for intentions classified as cooperative). This reflects a differential use of the outcome of the social interaction as a function of whether it is classified as competitive or cooperative. Thus, according to the intention attributed by the controller to the\u00a0other, PE signals differed and the strength of effective coupling increased between regions encoding the reliability difference of the controller and the dlPFC-TPJ network. When one expert is more reliable than the other, the Mixed-intentions Influence model predicts that the PE is driven by the valuation of the more reliable expert. Since the only difference between experts is the sign of the second-order mentalizing term, this suggests that the dlPFC-TPJ network at the outcome is more engaged when there is a need to mentalize intentions of other agents with opposing goals (i.e., intentions classified as competitive). Moreover, engagement of the dlPFC-TPJ network increases the probability of switching following a trial classified as competitive by the controller, allowing behavioral adaptation by virtue of the reliability difference signal. \n\nIn conclusion, our work provides evidence that the mixture of experts model explains behavior in socially volatile situations differing only by the reward function of other agents. These two experts only differ by their priors on how their reward function takes into account another agent\u2019s reward (i.e., the second order mentalizing term), and were sufficient to discriminate the others\u2019 intentions. These findings provide a mechanistic framework explaining the neurocomputations underlying learning in strategic social interactions. We extend to theory of mind processes (i.e., inferring cooperative vs competitive intentions and adapting to changes between these modes of interaction) a computational account similar to mixture of experts proposed to arbitrate between strategies in other domains, such as exploitation vs exploration , \u201cmodel-based\u201d vs \u201cmodel-free\u201d systems  and learning by imitation vs emulation . Finally, our Mixed-intentions Influence model may be useful in the fields of computational developmental psychology and computational neuropsychiatry to identify how specific computational components of the theory of mind develop in healthy children and are modified in neurological disorders . \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was approved by the National Ethics Committee (CPP Est II: 18\/592, ANSM: 2018-A01135-50), and all participants gave their informed written consent. A total of 31 participants (aged 20\u201340, M\u2009=\u200927, SD\u2009=\u20095.1\u201317 women) were recruited via a daily local newspaper and the University of Lyon 1 mailing list. All participants were screened to exclude those with medical conditions including psychological or physical illnesses or a history of head injury to prevent having confounding variables. Sex was determined based on self-reporting. Information about gender has not been collected. Sex-based analyses were not performed because the n is relatively low to compare between men and women. No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. \n\n\n### Mixed intentions task \n  \nParticipants performed a novel task comprising 163 trials in an MRI scanner. They were led to believe that they were interacting with another person via a computer interface, while in fact, they were playing against an artificial agent (AA) managed by a computer program. Such simulated social interactions allowed us to investigate the dynamics and neural mechanisms arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms. Participants were faced with a screen containing four cards, two face down (the other player\u2019s cards) and two face up (their own cards). Participants were informed that to win, they had to choose a card of the same color as the one the other person was going to choose. Experimenters were careful not to specify whether the other was an adversary or a partner. Participants were told that they and the other player had to make their choices in four seconds (Fig.\u00a0 ). If the Artificial Agent (AA) played before the participant, one of the two face-down cards was removed from the playing field. If the participant chose first, only the selected card remained on the playing field. Then, when both had chosen, the chosen cards were revealed and the participant received a reward if the card colors matched, otherwise they received nothing. Participants were led to believe that their final payoff would be increased by 10 c (euro) for each winning interaction. No information about the other\u2019s payoff was given to the participants, they only knew that after an interaction, the other \u2018participant\u2019 would see the same screen but with their own outcome which could be different from the participant. \n\nImportantly,   unbeknownst   to the participants, the artificial agent alternated between Competitive and Cooperative trial blocks. During this \u201cmixed intentions\u201d task, the AA\u2019s strategy was determined by alternating 13 trials of a matching pennies (MP) task (Competitive blocks), and 10 trials of a coordination game (Cooperative blocks). Importantly, if the regularity in the switches (every 10 or 13 trials) between modes was detected, we would expect a learning effect over time, reflecting higher success rate for late relative to early blocks, both for the Cooperative blocks and for the Competitive blocks. Logistic regression, however, indicated no statistically significant effect of the blocks\u2019 rank on the success rates in the Cooperative blocks (no significant rank effect, effect size on success rate = 0.14%,   p  \u2009=\u20090.637). Similarly, there was no significant learning effect over blocks for the Competitive blocks (no rank effect, effect size on success rate = 0.06%,   p  \u2009=\u20090.779). In addition, similar logistic regressions on the probability to switch indicated no statistically significant change in the switch strategy across Competitive blocks (size effect of Competitive block rank: 0.004,   p  \u2009=\u20090.095) or across Cooperative blocks (size effect of Cooperative block rank: 0.001,   p  \u2009=\u20090.765). \n\nThe artificial agent algorithm was designed to predict the color that would be chosen by the participant on the basis of a probabilistic analysis of the two previous choices and outcomes (see SI for the algorithm). Here we defined a competitive choice, made by the AA, as choosing the card of the color the participant was expected not to play and a cooperative choice as choosing the card with the same color. Thus, the artificial agent exploited the bias of the participants in a stochastic way, i.e. the more predictable the participant was, the more the algorithm made correct competitive or cooperative choices (see SI). Participants were not informed of the switches between the two blocks (Cooperative vs Competitive), however, their goal was always to choose the same color as that chosen by the other player (i.e. the AA). \n\nThe MP task is competitive, and the computer uses the record of the participant\u2019s choice and reward history to minimize the participant\u2019s payoff. Therefore, in this case the participant\u2019s optimal strategy during the MP task is to choose the two targets randomly across trials. During the coordination game, the AA tried to maximize the participant\u2019s payoff and in this case the participants should try to choose one of the two targets consistently so that the computer can choose the same target as them. Since the participant is not informed of either the goals of the AA or the switches between blocks, they must adjust their strategy based on recent experience and infer cooperation\/competition on the basis of their observations. \n\nThis task was designed to identify key components of the adaptation to the other\u2019s intentions regarding whether others are cooperating or competing. We took advantage of the fact that an individual\u2019s estimates as to whether they are engaged in a cooperative or competitive interaction can be assessed even when the individual is interacting with a computer program rather than another person. Transitions between the Competitive and Cooperative blocks were unsignaled, therefore participants had to discover by trial and error the most successful strategy over consecutive blocks. This alternation between the two interaction modes functioned well because the participant\u2019s winning rate was significantly higher in Cooperative (mean 60% std 1%) than in Competitive (mean 44% std 1%) trials (two-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test   p  \u2009<\u200910-3 CI95 [0.10; 0.24]). Moreover, not only the winning rate (which could be driven by the other\u2019s change in strategy) shows that the design functions well, but also the change in switching strategies of participants. Indeed, the switching strategy of participants depended upon the mode (Cooperative or Competitive) of interaction on the previous trial (Mean difference =5.43%,   p  \u2009=\u20090.036), but participants also changed their switching strategy using the Cooperativity signature of AA depending on the mode (Cooperative or Competitive) of the Artificial agent of the previous trial (Mean difference\u2009=\u20099.61%,   p  \u2009=\u20090.0012, marginal effect of panel data logistic regression clustered by participant of switch strategy on the mode of interaction, the Cooperativity signature of AA and their interactions, no multicollinearity was found between the regressors in this analysis). The cooperativity Signature of AA was defined as the binomial variable representing the interaction between the last action of the Artificial Agent (AA) and the participant\u2019s own previous outcome. That is, the Cooperativity signature of AA was set to 1 if either the participant had won on the previous trial and the AA stayed on the same target in the next trial, or if the participant lost on the previous trial and the AA switched to the other target in the next trial. Otherwise, the variable was set to 0. Indeed, if the AA is a cooperative partner, both players should choose to keep the same target after winning to be more predictable. \n\n\n### Artificial agent \n  \nThe AA calculated the probability p for the participant to select a particular target color based on the history of the two previous choices and their outcomes. Then, this prediction was exploited in a probabilistic fashion (see SI): in the Cooperative mode the AA chose the color card it predicted with probability p, while in the Competitive mode this color was chosen with probability 1-p. \n\n\n### Behavioral analysis \n  \nFor the logistic regressions, we reported significant marginal effect of a given variable under the name \u201c  estimate  \u201d (for example:  ). \n\n represents independent variable and   represents the associated weight in the logistic regression.   represent the probability of a given event. The marginal effect of the variable   is defined as: \n\nThe mean is computed across all observed data. Thus, the marginal effect called \u201c  estimate  \u201d can easily be interpreted as the discreet change of the dependent variable given a unitary change of an independent variable. \n\nFor the linear regressions, reported \u201c  estimate  \u201d represents   i.e., the regression coefficient. Indeed, in a linear regression, marginal effect of a variable is equal to the estimated coefficient. \n\nFor both logistic and linear regression, we specified a data panel on Stata (Version 14.1) to account for the repeated measures within each participant\u2019s game. We then used a random-effects model with cluster\u2013robust standard errors for panels nested within participants, allowing for intra-participant correlation. The optimization method was maximum likelihood estimation using Gauss\u2013Hermite quadrature to approximate the likelihood. For the coefficient estimation, we used a robust estimator (sandwich method also called Eicker\u2013Huber\u2013White standard errors) to be robust for heteroscedasticity. \n\nWe assessed the distribution\u2019s normality and equality of variance where applicable. If these assumptions were met, we proceeded with a parametric test; otherwise, we opted for the non-parametric version of the test. \n\n\n### Models \n  \nTo test for a dynamic tracking of implicit intention, we compared 11 models with 6 involving theory of mind (  Inf  ,   k-ToM  ) and the remaining 5 to control for other possible strategies. The influence models (  Inf  ) rely on Taylor expanded reinforcement learning  to take into account the influence of one\u2019s own strategy on the strategy of the other.   k-ToM   models also take into account the influence of one\u2019s own strategy on the other but in a Bayesian fashion . These two models were adapted in their cooperative and competitive versions. Moreover, we constructed an adaptation of these two models (  Inf  ,   k-ToM  ) in which an arbitrator weights the cooperative and competitive versions according to their reliability before making the decision. Finally, because k-ToM is a recursive model (\u201cI think that you think that\u2026), we included k-ToM of depth one and two for each version. \n\nTo control for strategies that did not include theory of mind we added 5 other models including two Bayesian inference types (  HGF   and   BSL  ). The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (  HGF  )  basically tracks the external volatility of the artificial agent\u2019s choices in a Bayesian hierarchical way. The Bayesian Sequences Learner (  BSL  ) strategy relies on Bayesian inference given past sequences of choices. In a model free analysis, we found that participants tended to use the past 2 choices to make their next choice, so we used sequences of depths 2 and 3. Finally, we added two non-Mentalizing non-Bayesian models, a reinforcement learning model (RL) and a model based on the heuristic Win-Stay \/ Lose-Switch that we observed in the model free analysis. \n\nModels were individually fit using Variational Based method with the VBA toolbox. Every prior was set to their default values. With this method we were able to find free parameters that minimized the free energy of the model . \n\nThe Bayesian model selection (BMS) was performed using the VBA toolbox (Variational Bayesian Analysis) in a random effect analysis relying on the free energy as the lower bound of model evidence. We use protected Exceedance Probability measurements (pEP)  to select the model which was used most frequently in our population. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI acquisitions were performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using EPI BOLD sequences and T1 sequences at high resolution. Scans were performed in a Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner HealthCare at CERMEP Bron (single-shot EPI, TR \/ TE\u2009=\u20091600\/30, flip angle 75\u00b0, multiband acquisition (accelerator factor of 2), in an ascending interleaved manner with slices interlaced 2.40\u2009mm thickness, FOV\u2009=\u2009210\u2009mm. We also use the iPAT mode with an accelerator factor of 2 and the GRAPPA method reconstruction. The number of volumes acquired varied given the time the participant took to make their decisions. The first acquisition was made after stabilization of the signal (3 TR). Whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted structural scans (0.8 \u00d70.8 \u00d70.8\u2009mm) were acquired for each participant, co-registered with their mean EPI images and averaged across participants to permit anatomical localization of functional activations at the group level. Field map scans were acquired to obtain magnetization values that were used to correct for field inhomogeneity. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nImage analysis was performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK,  ). Time-series images were registered in a 3D space to minimize any effect that could result from participant head-motion. Once DICOMs were imported, functional scans were realigned to the first volume, corrected for slice timing and unwarped to correct for geometric distortions. Inhomogeneous distortions-related correction maps were created using the phase of non-EPI gradient echo images measured at two echo times (5.20\u2009ms for the first echo and 7.66\u2009ms for the second). Finally, in order to perform group and individual comparisons, they were co-registered with structural maps and spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas space using the DARTEL method. Then we ran ARTrepair to deweight scans that could include movement artefacts . \n\nWe ran general linear models (GLMs) analyses to identify which brain regions encoded: (a) one\u2019s belief that one is interacting in a cooperative or in a competitive situation (\u0394); (b) the reward prediction error (PE) after interactions classified as cooperative or competitive; (c) the PE difference between the trials classified as cooperative vs competitive. In every GLM, an event was defined as a stick function. The participant\u2019s button press and the AA\u2019s selection of target were defined as onset of no interest in all GLMs. For all GLMs, missing trials were modeled with four events (cue, participant\u2019s button press, AA\u2019s choice and outcome) as separate onsets without additional parametric regressors. Head movement parameters were added as parametric regressors of no interest to account for motion-related noise. Because the behavioral analysis showed that the bias towards competitive interaction affects the strategy of participants, we added the competitive bias (\u03b4) as a covariate at the second level analysis in all GLMs. \n\nSpecifically, in GLM1, there were 4 onsets, including the time of the cue presentation (cards on screen), participant\u2019s button press, AA\u2019s choice and the feedback time. Parametric regressors were the difference in reliability \u0394, the Cooperativity signature of AA(t-1), the previous winning interaction (t-1) (i.e. the boolean outcome of the previous interaction, 1 if it was a win, 0 if it was a loss) and the participant switch(t-1) at the time of the cue onset. At the outcome phase, parametric regressors were the reward prediction error (PE) as well as \u0394 to control for the effect of the believed intention of the other on the PE brain encoding. \n\nIn a second GLM (GLM2), we separated trials given the sign of \u0394 - \u03b4 (positive or negative) to identify brain regions specifically engaged in cooperative or competitive mental states (\u03b4 is a free parameter capturing the participant\u2019s bias toward competitive intent). \u0394 refers to the difference in reliability of cooperative and competitive prediction and \u03b4 is the competitive bias. For this GLM, there were 6 onsets, including the cue for trials classified by the winning Mixed-intentions influence model as cooperative or competitive, participant\u2019s button press, AA\u2019s choice and the feedback time for trials classified by the Mixed-intentions influence model as cooperative or competitive. Trials were classified by the Mixed-intentions influence model as either cooperative or competitive and parametric modulators were: the difference in reliability \u0394 and the decision value for staying on the same target at the time of the cue and the PE and \u0394 at the time of feedback. Three participants who always attributed the same intention to the AA were not included in GLM2. The mean number of trials classified as competitive by participants was 81.4 ( ). This represents approximately half of the trials (total number of trials = 163). \n\nTo test the additional hypothesis that brain activation observed for belief in other\u2019s intentions (Fig.\u00a0 ) is also present in Competitive vs Cooperative blocks, we conducted two more GLMs. One of them, GLM3, is similar to GLM2, i.e., we separated trials into two categories (in Cooperative or Competitive), but the distinction was made using the real mode of the AA rather than the classification made by the controller. Other onsets and parametric regressors were left unchanged. Another GLM was applied to check that the results observed in GLM2 were not simply due to the effect of volatility of the rewarded target. This GLM (GLM4) is similar to GLM2, i.e., trials were classified according to the sign of \u0394 - \u03b4. The only difference was that we added the actual probability that the AA would choose the same target as the previous trial as a parametric regressor at both the time of the cue and at the outcome. For each GLM, we turned off the serial orthogonalization function of regressors to allow them to compete for the variance. \n\nWe computed one paired t-tests with contrasts for main effect of \u0394 in GLM1 and effect of PE at the outcome time. Then we computed the contrast between competitive and cooperative PE regressors in GLM2, GLM3 and GLM4. Finally, we computed a paired t-test between this contrast, derived from GLM2 and GLM3, to formally test whether activation coming from the difference between classified trials was significantly higher than those coming from the difference between the actual modes of interaction as determined by the trial block. \n\nReported brain areas show a significant activity at the threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, whole brain family-wise error (FWE), corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (threshold at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected). \n\n\n### Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis \n  \nWe defined the attribution of cooperative or competitive intentions by the winning model at the time of decision-making as the psychological factor. Thus, we were able to investigate the difference in effective connectivity when deciding cooperative or competitive intent. For this PPI analysis, we focused on decision time and effective connectivity between regions encoding the others\u2019 intentions and all other voxels. Thus, for the physiological factor, we took the BOLD signal of the combined striatal and vmPFC regions elicited in GLM1 as encoding the intention of others. Otherwise, we used the same regressor parameters and onsets as GLM2. \n\nReported brain areas show a significant activity at the threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, whole brain family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (threshold at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected). \n\nTo test the hypothesis of a difference in either global or local efficiency between the two classified modes of interaction (competitive or cooperative), we used the   conn toolbox  . We included in the analyses a network with all ROIs of the   conn toolbox  . We then selected the 15% most connected nodes (i.e., adjacency matrix threshold at cost =0.15). This threshold was selected to enable the connectivity graph to be as close as possible to a \u201csmall world\u201d when referring to both global and local efficiencies. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11014977,"text_md5":"465f1174358893b3c21796a0252e795f","field_positions":{"authors":[0,114],"journal":[115,125],"publication_year":[127,131],"title":[142,230],"keywords":[244,309],"abstract":[322,1790],"body":[1799,78333]},"batch":3,"pmid":38609372,"doi":"10.1038\/s41467-024-47491-2","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11014977","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11014977"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11014977\">11014977<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11014977  Neurocomputational mechanisms involved in adaptation to fluctuating intentions of others"}
{"text":"Chen, Peng and Tang, Guoqiang and Wang, Yanglingxi and Xiong, Weiming and Deng, Yongbing and Fei, She and Zhang, Jun\nCNS Neurosci Ther, 2024\n\n# Title\n\nSpontaneous brain activity in the hippocampal regions could characterize cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease\n\n# Keywords\n\ncognitive impairment\nfractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation\nhippocampal regions; spontaneous brain activity\nParkinson's disease\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Objective \n  \nThis study aimed to investigate whether spontaneous brain activity can be used as a prospective indicator to identify cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nResting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS\u2010fMRI) was performed on PD patients. The cognitive level of patients was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. The fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was applied to measure the strength of spontaneous brain activity. Correlation analysis and between\u2010group comparisons of fMRI data were conducted using Rest 1.8. By overlaying cognitively characterized brain regions and defining regions of interest (ROIs) based on their spatial distribution for subsequent cognitive stratification studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 58 PD patients were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three groups: normal cognition (NC) group (27 patients, average MoCA was 27.96), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group (21 patients, average MoCA was 23.52), and severe cognitive impairment (SCI) group (10 patients, average MoCA was 17.3). It is noteworthy to mention that those within the SCI group exhibited the most advanced chronological age, with an average of 74.4\u2009years, whereas the MCI group displayed a higher prevalence of male participants at 85.7%. It was found hippocampal regions were a stable representative brain region of cognition according to the correlation analysis between the fALFF of the whole brain and cognition, and the comparison of fALFF between different cognitive groups. The parahippocampal gyrus was the only region with statistically significant differences in fALFF among the three cognitive groups, and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC, with an AUC of 0.673. The paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus was the region that identified SCI from NC, with an AUC of 0.941. The midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampa gyrus was the region that identified SCI from MCI, with an AUC of 0.926. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe parahippocampal gyrus was the potential brain region for recognizing cognitive impairment in PD, specifically for identifying MCI. Thus, the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus is expected to contribute to future study as a multimodal fingerprint for early warning. \n\n  \nSpontaneous brain activity (fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation \u2212 fALFF) in the hippocampal regions could reveal cognitive levels in patients with Parkinson's disease to differentiate normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms, including tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity. In addition to motor symptoms, non\u2010motor symptoms are considered to precede motor symptoms, affecting the quality of life. ,   Common non\u2010motor symptoms of PD include dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic failure, and sensory impairments. Dementia is most detrimental to the quality of life and increases mortality rates. ,   Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional stage between normal state and full\u2010blown dementia and is also a powerful predictor of dementia. ,  \n\nCurrently, the diagnostic criteria for PD\u2010MCI still need further revision and refinement. ,  ,  ,   Therefore, the research on PD\u2010MCI is increasing rapidly, and exploring the characteristics of different cognitive states in PD and the laws of transition between states is the focus of disease pathology research, especially finding the predictors of PD\u2010MCI to provide the theoretical reference for early treatment and rehabilitation. \n\nThe research found that demographic indicators of gender were a critical factor, that men were more likely to develop cognitive impairment, and that characteristics of cognitive impairment differed between genders.  Other factors included genotype, in which the Catechol\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase genotype was related to executive\u2010attention function ,   and the apolipoprotein E genotype was related to cognitive decline. \n\nIn the study of radiological imaging predictive factors, the cross\u2010sectional analysis suggested that PD\u2010MCI was more likely to develop brain atrophy, occurring in areas such as the left superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal lobe, insula,  right supramarginal gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and midcingulate cortex.  Cerebral small vessel disease and its imaging characteristics were related to gait, and cognition in PD patients. It was found white matter hyperintensity was associated with slow gait speed, decreased cadence, increased stride time, and increased stance phase time. The presence of lacune was associated with poor attention and impaired executive function. It was demonstrated white matter hyperintensity, number of lacunes, and microbleeds were positively correlated with the severity of motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments, while the perivascular space in the basal ganglia was only correlated with cognitive impairments. Moreover, monitoring cerebral blood flow by arterial spin labeling (ASL)\u2010MRI, researchers found hypoperfusion was a predictor of cognitive impairment in PD patients. ,   The above studies revealed multidimensional imaging markers of comorbid cognitive impairment in PD. However, the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and comorbid cognitive impairment in PD is unclear. \n\nThe emerging resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance (RS\u2010fMRI) technology has brought new methods for collecting brain neural activity. With the development of methodology, the proposal of fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) laid the foundation for characterizing neural activity. fALFF can be applied to analyze brain activity in the state of neurological diseases is widely used to explore the mechanism of neurological diseases, and has been found to have significant repeatability. In conclusion, this study used the RS\u2010fMRI method to detect the brain activity by fALFF in the cognitive brain regions in PD patients, and innovatively found the characteristics of cognitive stratification by comparing the differences in spontaneous brain activity between different cognitive groups. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe fMRI data were obtained from the brain imaging shared database \u2212 OpenNeuro ( ), with dataset number ds004392. This was a resting state functional imaging dataset comprising PD patients with different cognitive levels. In addition, the data also included baseline information such as cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), age, gender, handedness, and education level. The dataset included patients with the following features: (1) Patients diagnosed with PD; (2) Age: 55\u201389\u2009years; (3) Patients with different cognitive levels: MoCA 9\u201330; (4) years of education level: 7\u201324\u2009years. \n\n\n### Cognitive level categorization \n  \nThe MoCA was primarily utilized for evaluating cognitive function in elderly individuals and patients with neurological disorders by assessing attention, memory, language, and spatial abilities, with a total score of 30 points.  MoCA played a crucial role in the early detection of cognitive impairments, diagnosis of MCI, and evaluation of treatment efficacy. According to the distribution of MoCA, cognitive levels were classified into NC group (MoCA > 25), MCI group (MoCA 22\u201324), and severe cognitive impairment (SCI) group (MoCA < 22). ,  ,  ,   Furthermore, MCI together with SCI groups is considered to be the cognitively abnormal group. \n\n\n### Parameters of RS\u2010fMRI \n  \nRS\u2010fMRI scans were performed by using a 3.0 Tesla system (GE Medical Systems, ModelName: Signa HDxt) with gradient echo planar (percent phase field view\u2009=\u2009100, flip angle\u2009=\u200970\u00b0, echo time\u2009=\u200928\u2009ms, repetition time\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, total readout time: 32.76\u2009ms, pixel bandwidth\u2009=\u20097812.5; matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, and spacing between slices 4\u2009mm). \n\nIn addition, a 3D T1\u2010weighted image was acquired covering the whole brain (percent phase field view\u2009=\u2009100, flip angle =10\u00b0, echo time\u2009=\u20092.988\u2009ms, repetition time\u2009=\u200910.02\u2009ms, pixel bandwidth\u2009=\u2009122.109, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, and spacing between slices\u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n### Image data pre\u2010processing \n  \nThe MATLAB 2016b software with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12,  ) package was used for pre\u2010processing the resting state fMRI data. The first 10 volumes were discarded to eliminate the machine instability interference.  In further processing, slice timing, head motion correction (Friston 24), segment, spatial normalization to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm), smoothing (Gauss kernel of 4\u2009mm with full width and half height), and linear trend removal were performed. \n\n\n### fMRI data post\u2010processing \n  \nRest 1.8 ( ) software was applied for further processing. The time series of each voxel was transformed into the frequency domain and a power spectrum was then obtained. The square root of the power spectrum was calculated at each frequency and the average square root of the power spectrum within the frequency band of 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz was retained as the amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (ALFF).  Additionally, fALFF was defined as the ratio of the power of each frequency at the low\u2010frequency range (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to that of the entire detectable frequency range (0\u20130.25\u2009Hz).  The fALFF could accurately reflect the amplitude levels of brain regions within a specific frequency band, reducing inter\u2010individual differences and the influence of global signals.  Simultaneously, fALFF mitigates interference from physiological sources like heartbeat and respiration as it normalizes the amplitude for every frequency band.  Therefore, fALFF was selected to enhance data reliability and interpretability to investigate the correlation between spontaneous brain activity and cognition. \n\nThe impact of confounding variables on the outcomes was also elucidated in subsequent analyses, predominantly by adjusting for confounding variables (such as age, gender, handedness, education level) versus not making any adjustments. First, voxel\u2010based correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the association between fALFF and MoCA to identify brain regions associated with cognitive impairment (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >19 voxels). Second, one\u2010way ANOVA and post hoc analyses were applied to compare the differences in brain activity between three cognitive groups (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >19 voxels). Third, based on the prior knowledge of hippocampus and cognition, we performed correlation analysis between fALFF and MoCA for hippocampal regions to further screen cognitive representative regions of patients with PD. Fourth, a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test was used to compare the differences in brain activity in the hippocampal region between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups. Considering the smaller voxel levels in the hippocampal region, we used a relatively loose correction (AlphaSim corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >1 voxel) aimed at improving the sensitivity of the results. Subsequently, Anchored neurocognitive brain regions from the first three steps were overlapped to generate independent regions of interest (ROI) based on their spatial distribution in a sequential manner. Finally, the fALFF between the three cognitive groups was extracted, based on ROIs from overall and triple group level, for subsequent between\u2010group identification. \n\n\n### Routine statistical analyses \n  \nThe statistical analysis and graphical representation were conducted using SPSS 26 ( ), MedCalc ( ), and GraphPad Prism 9.5 ( ). Initially, the normality of the continuous variables was assessed through the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (SPSS 26). If the distribution was found to be normal, inter\u2010group comparisons were performed using two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test or one\u2010way analysis of variance with post\u2010hoc pair\u2010wise comparisons, reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SPSS 26 and GraphPad Prism 9.5). In cases of non\u2010normal distribution, the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test was utilized, and the results were presented as median and quartiles (SPSS 26). The count data were compared using the Chi\u2010square test (SPSS 26). \n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized for constructing a predictive measure (MedCalc). The discriminative capability of fALFF was assessed by computing the area under the ROC curve (AUC). An AUC value of 1.0 denotes perfect discrimination, while an AUC value of 0.5 implies a lack of discriminative ability. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic analysis \n  \nA total of 58 PD patients were enrolled in this study, with an average age of 70.03\u2009years, predominantly male, accounting for 67.2% (39 patients), and predominantly right\u2010handed, accounting for 87.9% (51 patients). The education level was 16.21\u2009years, and the average cognitive score (MoCA) was 24.52. According to the MoCA, patients were divided into three groups: NC group (27 patients, average MoCA was 27.96), MCI group (21 patients, average MoCA was 23.52), and SCI group (10 patients, average MoCA was 17.3). Patients with SCI were the oldest at 74.4\u2009years in three cognitive groups. In terms of gender, patients with MCI had a higher proportion of males (85.7%) than other groups. There was no significant difference in the education level and the proportion of right\u2010handed in the three cognitive groups (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nBaseline characteristics of patients with PD. \n    \n\n### Correlation analysis between fALFF of whole brain and cognition in PD patients \n  \nWe analyzed the correlation between whole brain fALFF by voxels and MoCA in PD patients. Without adjusting for confounding factors such as age, gender, handedness, education level, brain regions correlated with cognition included Right Brainstem, Midbrain, Limbic Lobe, Hippocampus, Parahippocampa Gyrus, Amygdala, Fusiform, Occipital Lobe, Parahippocampa Gyrus, Lingual Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ).

We found that after adjusting for confounding factors, only the posterior cingulate was newly identified as a cognitive\u2010related brain region (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nCorrelation between whole brain fALFF level and MoCA in PD patients. (A) Without adjusting for confounding factors, brain regions correlated with cognition included the Right Brainstem, Midbrain, Limbic Lobe, Hippocampus, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Amygdala, Fusiform, Occipital Lobe, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Lingual Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus.

Without adjusting for confounding factors such as age, gender, handedness, education level, brain regions with differences in fALFF among three cognitive groups included Midbrain, Limbic Lobe, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Brainstem, Brodmann area 34, Amygdala, Frontal Lobe (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). After adjusting for confounding factors, brain regions with differences in fALFF among three cognitive groups included the Midbrain, Brainstem, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Limbic Lobe, Amygdala, Brodmann area 34, and Frontal Lobe (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). We found that whether the confounding factors were adjusted or not, differential brain regions among the three cognitive groups were basically the same, but the voxel number values of the brain regions were different. \n  \nComparison of fALFF between three cognitive groups. (A) Without adjusting for confounding factors, brain regions with differences in fALFF among three cognitive groups included Midbrain, Limbic Lobe, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Brainstem, Brodmann area 34, Amygdala, Frontal Lobe. (B) After adjusting for confounding factors, brain regions with differences in fALFF among three cognitive groups included Midbrain, Brainstem, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Limbic Lobe, Amygdala, Brodmann area 34, and Frontal Lobe. brain regions among the three cognitive groups were basically the same, whether the confounding factors were adjusted or not. (C, F) There was no statistically significant difference in fALFF between PD patients with MCI and NC, regardless of adjustment for confounding factors. (D) Comparing PD patients with SCI and NC, without adjusting for confounding factors, there were differences in fALFF including Brainstem, Midbrain, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Brodmann area 34, Limbic Lobe, Mammillary body, Hippocampus, Occipital Lobe, Precuneus, Frontal Lobe, Brodmann area 4, Paracentral Lobule, Postcentral Gyrus.

We found no statistically significant difference in fALFF between PD patients with MCI and NC, regardless of adjustment for confounding factors (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\nWhen comparing PD patients with SCI and NC, without adjusting for confounding factors, there were differences in fALFF including Brainstem, Midbrain, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Brodmann area 34, Limbic Lobe, Mammillary Bod, Hippocampus, Occipital Lobe, Precuneus, Frontal Lobe, Brodmann area 4, Paracentral Lobule, Postcentral Gyrus (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ).

After adjusting for confounding factors, differential brain regions were basically the same, but the voxel number values of the brain regions were decreased, including differences in fALFF of Midbrain, Brainstem, Limbic Lobe, Parahippocampa Gyrus, Brodmann area 34, Precuneus, Calcarine, Brodmann area 31, Occipital Lobe, Posterior Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Frontal Lobe (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Correlation analysis between fALFF of hippocampus and cognition in PD patients \n  \nBased on the prior knowledge of hippocampus and cognition, we further analyzed the correlation between hippocampus fALFF by voxels and MoCA in PD patients. We found the hippocampus was a stable representative brain region of cognition, regardless of adjustment for confounding factors (Figure\u00a0 , Tables\u00a0  and  ). \n  \nCorrelation between hippocampus fALFF level and MoCA in PD patients. (A) The hippocampus was a stable representative brain region of cognition. Related regions in the hippocampus without adjusting for confounding factors. (B) The hippocampus was a stable representative brain region of cognition. Related regions in the hippocampus after adjusting confounding factors. \n  \n\n### Differences in hippocampal fALFF between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups \n  \nThe study found that the cognitive level of PD patients could be effectively characterized by their spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampus region. To reveal the baseline level of spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampus of the PD patients with NC, we further compared the differences in fALFF in the hippocampus region between NC and cognitively abnormal patients and quantified the fALFF values. Specifically, Figure\u00a0  presents the fALFF\u2010reduced (Figure\u00a0 ) and \u2010enhanced (Figure\u00a0 ) brain regions of patients with cognitively abnormal, both uncorrected (Figure\u00a0 ) and corrected (Figure\u00a0 ) for confounders. The fALFF quantification showed that compared to the cognitively abnormal group, the NC group was 0.936\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015 vs. 0.918\u2009\u00b1\u20090.012 (Figure\u00a0 ) and 0.916\u2009\u00b1\u20090.029 vs. 0.937\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025 (Figure\u00a0 ), while corrected for confounders was 0.932\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014 vs. 0.915\u2009\u00b1\u20090.018 (Figure\u00a0 ) and 0.918\u2009\u00b1\u20090.019 vs. 0.936\u2009\u00b1\u20090.020 (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nQuantitative results of fALFF values reveal differences in spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampal region between the cognitively abnormal and the NC groups (*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation). (A) The fALFF\u2010reduced brain regions in the hippocampus of patients with cognitively abnormal (uncorrected for confounders). (B) The fALFF\u2010reduced brain regions (corrected for confounders). (C) The fALFF\u2010enhanced brain regions uncorrected for confounders. (D) The fALFF\u2010enhanced distribution of the brain regions corrected for confounders. \n  \n\n### Making ROIs in different brain regions \n  \nWe overlay the differential brain regions expressed by Figures\u00a0 ,  ,   and obtained 10 ROIs in Figure\u00a0  according to the spatial distribution, including Paracentral lobule, Postcentral Gyrus (ROI 1), Precuneus (ROI 2), Calcarine, Posterior Cingulate (ROI 3), Left Hippocampus (ROI 4), Parahippocampa Gyrus (ROI 5), Midbrain, Hippocampus, Parahippocampa Gyrus (ROI 6), Midbrain, Right Hippocampus (ROI 7), Parahippocampa Gyrus, Fusiform Gyrus, Gyrus Lingualis (ROI 8), Hippocampus, Parahippocampa Gyrus (ROI 9), Right Hippocampus, Temporal Lobe (ROI 10) (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nDefining the ROIs.

When comparing PD patients with MCI and NC, there were differences in fALFF only including ROI 5. When comparing PD patients with SCI and NC, there were differences in fALFF of 8 regions including ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 7, ROI 8 and ROI 10. When comparing PD patients with SCI and MCI, there were differences in fALFF of 7 regions including ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 8, and ROI 10. ROI 5 was the only region with statistically significant differences in fALFF among the three cognitive groups. We found that ROI 5 had the highest fALFF in PD patients with NC and the lowest fALFF in patients with SCI. \n  \nComparison of fALFF of 10 ROIs between different cognitive groups; The order of   X  \u2010axis numbers corresponds to the order of ROIs (#*$  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; SCI, severe cognitive impairment). \n  \n\n### The potential ability to identify cognitive impairment by ROIs \n  \nWe produce ROC\u2010AUC for the evaluation of the potential of ROIs to identify cognitive impairment. The AUC of fALFF of ROI 5 in distinguishing PD patients with MCI from NC was 0.673 (Figure\u00a0 ). The AUC of fALFF of ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 7, ROI 8, ROI 10 in distinguishing PD patients with SCI from NC was 0.941, 0.772, 0.844, 0.920, 0.887, 0.857, 0.811, 0.800, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). The AUC of fALFF of ROI 1, ROI 2, ROI 3, ROI 5, ROI 6, ROI 8, ROI 10 in distinguishing PD patients with SCI from MCI was 0.850, 0.910, 0.907, 0.869, 0.926, 0.776, 0.702, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). The results revealed that parahippocampal gyrus (ROI 5) was the only region that identified PD patients with MCI and NC. The paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus (ROI 1) was the best region that identified PD patients with SCI and NC, with an AUC of 0.941. The midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampa gyrus (ROI 6) was the best region that identified PD patients with SCI and MCI, with an AUC of 0.926. \n  \nThe potential ability of ROIs to identify between cognitive impairments (AUC: area under the curve).

The prevalence of dementia in PD patients was approximately 30%, with an incidence rate of 24.3\/1000\/year (95% confidence interval, 7.7\u201358).  Cognitive impairment was a manifestation in the early stage of dementia. Early detection and intervention of cognitive impairment could improve the quality of life of PD patients. ,   The research on brain activity associated with cognitive impairment of PD patients had important implications not only for the treatment and management of PD patients but also for further understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD. We used RS\u2010fMRI technology to collect brain activity parameters and applied network perspective to study the differences in brain activity in PD patients and find the early warning methods of PD\u2010MCI diagnosis. \n\nThe resting state was a state in which the brain was quiet, relaxed, and awake without performing cognitive tasks, and was the most basic and essential state of various complex states of the brain. The amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was a signal intensity of the blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) sequence, which was used to describe the brain activity intensity of a single voxel and was an important feature in describing resting\u2010state images.  In order to reduce the sensitivity of ALFF to physiological noise and improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting spontaneous brain activity, the fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was used in our research. \n\nFrom the perspective of brain activity, the use of ALFF to study non\u2010motor characteristics of PD patients was the hot research. In the study of anxiety characteristics in PD, Zhang study found that the fALFF of the left cerebellum, cerebellum posterior lobe, bilateral temporal cortex, and brainstem were higher, while the fALFF of bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, and left inferior parietal lobule were lower. Right, precuneus, and left caudate were correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale.  By monitoring different brain regions ALFF, Criaud found that anxiety in PD was associated with the over\u2010activation of the amygdala and impaired inter\u2010relationship of regions involved in behavior (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex, insula) and motor control (i.e. basal ganglia).  The fALFF of bilateral putamen in PD patients with cognitive impairment was low, and the fALFF of left putamen was negatively correlated with the scores of PD\u2010MCI patients on the Movement Disorder Society\u2010Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III.  Monitoring ALFF in the bilateral primary motor cortex, the occipital cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia could predict the effect of dopaminergic therapy in PD patients. \n\n\n### The hippocampus is the important brain region for cognitive impairment in PD \n  \nWe analyzed the correlation between whole brain fALFF by voxels and cognition in PD patients. We found similar results in brain regions to previous studies, including the brainstem, hippocampal structure, limbic lobe, amygdala, occipital lobe, etc. ,   These results indicated that the above brain regions were closely related to cognition, attention, and memory. \n\nAbout 26.7% (18.9%\u201338.2%) of non\u2010demented PD patients were considered MCI,  and an even higher proportion of 40% was considered MCI.  In order to find the characteristic brain regions of PD\u2010MCI, we compared fALFF between PD patients with MCI and NC. Unfortunately, there was no statistically significant difference in fALFF between the two groups regardless of adjustment for confounding factors. A previous study demonstrated that compared with PD\u2010NC, PD\u2010MCI showed significantly increased ALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. \n\nResults found that hippocampal structure was not only a brain region related to cognition in PD patients but also a differential fALFF brain region in PD\u2010SCI. The hippocampus was closely related to learning, memory, emotional response, and other brain neural activities, and it was also an important target for research on cognitive impairment in PD patients because the temporal lobe has been identified as crucial for encoding and memory consolidation. ,  \n\nIn terms of magnetic resonance imaging, previous studies have demonstrated an association between hippocampal atrophy and MCI, as well as dementia. ,  ,   We innovatively analyzed the correlation between hippocampus fALFF by voxels and cognition in PD patients. It was found that regardless of confounding factors such as age, gender, handedness, education level, the hippocampal region was a stable representative brain region of cognition. \n\n\n### Feasibility of parahippocampal gyrus in predicting cognitive impairment in PD patients \n  \nThe purpose and methods of the current research were limited to speculating the effect of hippocampal atrophy on cognitive impairment in PD patients from the perspective of imaging. Gray matter atrophy of the hippocampus in PD patients resulted in impairment of functional connectivity, associated with different stages of cognitive impairment. ,   At present, some researchers explored the function of the hippocampus in PD patients from the perspective of brain activity. In the study of non\u2010motor symptoms of PD patients, Xu found an abnormal degree of centrality value in the hippocampus, and parahippocampus was observed separately in the conventional band and in the slow\u20104 band in PD with apathy, which confirmed the density of internal functional connections in hippocampal decreased.  Zi performed statistical differences in fALFF between patients in PD with excessive daytime sleepiness and analyzed the changes in the functional connection within the whole brain. It was found that the functional connectivity in the right hippocampus\/parahippocampal was decreased, which resulted in damage to the dopaminergic circuits in the limbic system and subsequently inhibited the arousal mechanism.  However, Wang found that ALFF was elevated in the hippocampal structure in PD patients, and the hippocampus was an important structure for studying PD. \n\nBy comparing the fALFF of three cognitive groups, we found that the parahippocampal gyrus corresponding to the ROI 5 brain region was the different brain region of the three cognitive groups, and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC. The parahippocampal gyrus was an important and active region of the limbic system, whose main functions included creating memories and recalling visual scenes. The research found that impaired function of the parahippocampal gyrus in PD\u2010MCI led to memory impairment  and showed that parahippocampal gyrus was essential for discovering connections between things and finding target objects. \n\nWe also found that the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus of PD patients with SCI decreased more significantly than that of PD patients with MCI and NC. Previous evidence of hippocampal atrophy combined with our results of decreased parahippocampal gyrus activity might account for and predict the cognitive impairment in PD patients. Similarly, in the study of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, it was found that abnormal brain activities in different parts of brain were related to pathological processes, which provided theoretical support for explaining the mechanism of cognitive impairment in imaging perspective. ,   The study found that sharp ripples are a manifestation of interactions between the hippocampus and cortical loops, which are closely linked to cognition and memory.  However, whether similar cognitive loop abnormalities exist in the PD co\u2010morbid cognitively impaired population warrants elucidation in terms of functional versus causal connectivity. \n\nIn order to explore the ability of brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus to identify cognitive impairment, we found that the fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus of PD patients with MCI decreased more significantly than that of PD patients with SCI, which indicated that the brain activity of parahippocampal gyrus decreased, and its functional impairment was closely related to cognitive impairment. The fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus was 0.673 of AUC for identifying MCI and NC, 0.920 of AUC for identifying SCI and NC, and 0.869 of AUC for identifying SCI and MCI. From our perspective, the ability of fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus in identifying SCI from NC and MCI was acceptable, but the AUC for identifying the most important MCI from NC was 0.673, and its ability to identify was ordinary. This may be a potential biomarker worth combining with other indicators. \n\n\n### Limitations need to be discussed \n  \nFirstly, common and typical results of brain activity in PD patients were found based on the current sample size, but the robustness of the results was worth further verifying in a larger sample size. Secondly, brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus was found to be an effective region for cognitive stratification in PD patients, but the brain regions (functional connectivity) affected by the abnormal parahippocampal gyrus activity were still unclear. It was suggested that regional homogeneity and functional connectivity methods were recommended to explore the relationship between brain regions in future studies. In addition, it is a consensus that structure determines function. From the perspective of brain activity, we showed the new discoveries, however, it was beneficial to further understand the pathological mechanism of PD patients evolving into different cognitive states by multimodal methods finding the changes between structure and function. Finally, abnormal brain activity in the parahippocampal gyrus could early identify PD\u2010MCI and became an early warning indicator, however, its ability to identify was ordinary. We suggested that in further research, it was necessary to combine other biochemical indicators, cerebral blood flow, and other parameters to comprehensively analyze. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nAccording to the research, the cognitive impairment of PD patients was associated with age and gender. By comparing the fALFF of three cognitive groups, discovery of the parahippocampal gyrus as an anchored differential brain region and it was also the only brain region to identify MCI from NC. It was revealed parahippocampal gyrus was the prospective brain region for recognizing cognitive impairment in PD, specifically for identifying MCI. In view of the ordinary ability of fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus to identify the most important MCI from NC, it was necessary to combine fALFF of parahippocampal gyrus with other indicators for early warning study. \n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION \n  \nThe funding was provided by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2022CDJYGRH\u2010015); the National Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (CSTB2022NSCQ\u2010MSX1503); Medical Research Project of Science and Technology Bureau and Health Commission (2023MSXM076); and Project of Chongqing Key Laboratory of Emergency Medicine (2024RCCX01). \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10999557,"text_md5":"d982eb3c14db448863fb7397e2e63ece","field_positions":{"authors":[0,116],"journal":[117,134],"publication_year":[136,140],"title":[151,281],"keywords":[295,434],"abstract":[447,3071],"body":[3080,37833]},"batch":3,"pmid":38584347,"doi":"10.1111\/cns.14706","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10999557","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10999557"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10999557\">10999557<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10999557  Spontaneous brain activity in the hippocampal regions could characterize cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease"}

However, various methodologies have been developed for assessing dFC, and it is unclear how the choice of method affects the results. In this work, we aimed to study the results variability of commonly used dFC methods. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe implemented 7 dFC assessment methods in Python and used them to analyze the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 395 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We measured the similarity of dFC results yielded by different methods using several metrics to quantify overall, temporal, spatial, and intersubject similarity. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur results showed a range of weak to strong similarity between the results of different methods, indicating considerable overall variability. Somewhat surprisingly, the observed variability in dFC estimates was found to be comparable to the expected functional connectivity variation over time, emphasizing the impact of methodological choices on the final results.

They also emphasize the importance of distinguishing neural-driven dFC variations from physiological confounds and developing validation frameworks under a known ground truth. To facilitate such investigations, we provide an open-source Python toolbox,   PydFC  , which facilitates multianalysis dFC assessment, with the goal of enhancing the reliability and interpretability of dFC studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n    \nThe impact of diverse dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) assessment methods on dynamic brain connectivity results was examined. \n  \nSubstantial variability among methods, comparable to temporal variation, was revealed. \n  \nThree method groups in terms of dFC results similarity were revealed. \n  \nAn open-source Python toolbox,   PydFC  , supporting multianalysis dFC assessments, was introduced. \n  \nOverall, the results suggest that multianalysis approaches may enhance reliability and interpretability of dFC studies. \n   \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) has emerged as an important measure for understanding brain function and as a biomarker with significant potential [ ]. FC is typically assessed using blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). FC assessment was initially performed under the assumption that it does not change over time (stationarity). However, growing evidence supports that the dynamic variations of FC (dynamic FC [dFC]) play a critical role in brain functional organization and may provide a link between neural dynamics and cognition in healthy and diseased conditions [ ]. The significance of dFC extends beyond understanding interactions between brain regions. Recent studies have shown that patterns of dFC can reveal differences between healthy and diseased individuals and therefore could be used as a clinical biomarker. In this regard, several studies have reported alterations in dFC patterns in a number of neurological or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) [ ], attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ ], depression [ ], posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ ], schizophrenia (SZ) [ ], Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [ ], and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [ ]. \n\nIn recent years, a variety of methodologies for assessing dFC have been developed [ ,  ]. As the number of available methods continues to grow, there is an increasing need to comprehensively review these methodologies and examine their relative advantages and disadvantages, as well as converge toward recommendations for their application to experimental data [ ]. To date, several studies have reviewed different aspects of these methods and have highlighted the importance of understanding their limitations and underlying assumptions [ ,  ]. However, only a few of these studies have compared different methods in practice [ ,  ], and none have provided a comprehensive comparison of the results yielded by commonly used dFC assessment methods. \n\nMost studies that have applied dFC to various applications have not reported a clear justification for adopting a specific methodology for assessing dFC [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. For example, in clinical applications, some studies have employed sliding-window and clustering methods (e.g., PTSD [ ], PD [ ], SZ [ ,  ,  ]), while others have preferred hidden Markov model (HMM) approaches (e.g., SZ [ ], PTSD [ ,  ], mild cognitive impairment [MCI] [ ]), or time-frequency methods (e.g., ASD [ ,  ], SZ [ ]). It is worth noting that very few studies have used multiple methodologies (e.g., chronic headache [ ], disorders of consciousness [DOCs] [ ]). Similarly, in cognitive and behavioral applications, some studies have used sliding-window and clustering methods (e.g., task prediction [ ], cognitive and behavioral flexibility [ ]), some have used coactivation patterns (CAP) analysis (e.g., naturalistic stimuli [ ], multiple tasks [ ]) and HMM (e.g., sleep stage [ ], impulsivity [ ]), and very few have used multiple methods (e.g., working memory task [ ]). A complete list of the reviewed studies can be found in  ,  , and  . Strikingly, of the 62 dFC studies that we reviewed, only 4 considered more than 1 method to assess the robustness of their results. This is somewhat concerning since the variation in the dFC assessment results due to the choice of the assessment methodology (i.e., its analytical flexibility) has been studied on a relatively limited basis until now [ ]. \n\nAnalytical flexibility has recently become a critical issue in neuroimaging, particularly in fMRI data analysis [ ]. Several studies have revealed significant variations in the results obtained from multiple independent analyses using the same dataset, highlighting the impact that analytical flexibility may have on scientific findings. For example, a study by [ ] revealed considerable variation in the results reported by 70 independent teams using a common dataset, emphasizing the need for performing and comparing multiple analyses on the same dataset, as well as identifying the factors that explain the variation in the obtained results. \n\nSimilarly, the analytical flexibility of dFC assessment may greatly influence the reliability of the findings about brain functional organization and its alterations in diseased groups. Although several studies have investigated the reproducibility across individuals and scan sites of dFC patterns at rest [ ,  ,  ], no study has fully investigated the analytical flexibility of dFC assessments. It is also unclear how methodological variations compare to the expected biological variations. The need for understanding dFC analytical flexibility in the context of biological variability is a first critical step for result interpretation and for drawing conclusions about brain functional organization and its alterations in diseased groups. \n\nResting-state fMRI data lack a reliable biological reference for quantifying the scale of variability of dFC across assessment methods. It is well known that fMRI data are an indirect measure of the neural activity and are also modulated by physiological and motion processes [ ,  ]. This further complicates setting a biological reference. However, dFC variation over time or over subjects can serve as fair biological references. Comparing the variability over methods to dFC temporal variability would yield an interpretable biological scale. In other words, if assessing dFC at one time point across methods results in as much variation as the one found across time points using one method, then variability between methods is as large as the scale of the biological phenomenon that they intend to capture. This approach enabled us to directly compare the magnitude of the effect of methodology choice to the underlying biological phenomenon. An alternative to variability in time is intersubject variability, which can also help scale the magnitude of variations over method. \n\nIn this study, we assess the analytical flexibility of dFC estimation by investigating how dFC patterns estimated from the same dataset vary across a large selection of methods. Among the available dFC assessment methods, we have selected 7 widely used methods: CAP [ ], the clustering method [ ], continuous HMM [ ], discrete HMM [ ], the sliding-window method [ ], the time-frequency (wavelet-based) method [ ], and the window-less method [ ]. \n\nThe selected dFC assessment methods differ in terms of their basic underlying assumptions, ranging from the window-less method, which places a minimal set of assumptions, to the HMM-based methods, which place the most rigid assumptions [ ]. Furthermore, some of these methods are state-based methods, meaning that they assume a finite number of group-level FC spatiotemporal patterns or \u201cFC states\u201d recurring over time (CAP, clustering, continuous HMM, discrete HMM, and window-less), while the rest are state-free methods that do not impose any constraints on the estimated FC patterns (sliding window and time-frequency). Moreover, the examined methods differ with regards to whether they assume locality of neighboring time points. Briefly, locality assumption means that the FC at each time point is inferred from the data points that are close in time (sliding window, time-frequency, clustering, continuous HMM, and discrete HMM) or not (CAP and window-less). The methods also differ in whether they consider the temporal ordering of data points (sliding window, time-frequency, clustering, continuous HMM, and discrete HMM) or disregard this information (CAP and window-less). State-based methods may also vary in terms of assuming smooth transitions between different states (continuous HMM and discrete HMM) or allowing instantaneous reconfiguration (CAP, clustering, and window-less) [ ]. Table\u00a0  lists these 7 methods along with their number of citations (note that these numbers refer to the particular study that introduced them and hence may not be entirely reflective of the overall popularity of each method), year of publication, and assumptions. For the detailed pipeline used for each method, as well as their important hyperparameters, please see Fig.\u00a0 . \n  \nPipeline of the 7 dFC assessment methods (time series of all subjects are concatenated in the time dimension for state-based methods prior to finding FC states):   Time-frequency   [ ]: wavelet transform coherence (WTC) between each pair of regions is computed after applying the wavelet transform on region time courses. Finally, dFC assessment is performed by averaging WTC over all frequency scales.   Sliding window   [ ]: dFC is assessed for each time window using a sliding window that moves over data time points and typically uses Pearson correlation as the metric to quantify FC for each pair of regions.   Clustering   [ ]: applies 2-level   k  -means clustering on the sequence of measured dFC matrices from the sliding-window method to find the clusters that correspond to different FC states. Cluster centroids are considered the state FC matrices, and the sequence of clustering labels is considered the state time course.   Discrete hidden Markov model (HMM)   [ ]: the state FC matrices and the state time course inferred by clustering are used as the observation sequence of a categorical HMM. The model then finds the hidden states and infers the corresponding state FC matrices and the state time course.   Continuous HMM   [ ]: the BOLD data are fed to a Gaussian HMM. The model finds the hidden states and their continuous observation models. It then infers the state FC matrices and the state time course.   Window-less   [ ]: a sparse dictionary learning is applied on the BOLD data using a   k  -SVD model to infer the dictionary matrix (D) and the mixing matrix (M). Next, state FC matrices and the state time course are obtained from D and M, respectively.   Coactivation pattern (CAP)   [ ]: clustering is performed on vectors of BOLD activity at each time point. Next, outer product of each centroid vector and its transpose is calculated and forms the state FC matrix corresponding to that cluster. The sequence of clustering labels of time points is considered the state time course. The table in the figure shows a list of all implemented dFC assessment methods and their important hyperparameters. Note that the state FC matrices in this figure\u00a0are denoted using the term \u201cFCS.\u201d \n    \nThe seven selected dFC assessment methods and their number of citations, year of first publication, and assumptions \n  \nComparing different methods for assessing dFC poses significant challenges due to several factors. The primary challenge arises from the differences in the underlying assumptions and the mathematical framework of various methods, coupled with the lack of a clear ground truth for measuring the accuracy of the results [ ,  ]. Additionally, the distribution of estimated dFC values across methods can differ significantly, precluding the use of common similarity metrics such as the Euclidean distance or Pearson\u2019s correlation. The distribution of dFC values may not necessarily be Gaussian, and these values may considerably vary with regards to their mean and variance (see  ). Furthermore, the output format of different methods varies, making direct comparisons more challenging. For instance, some methods, such as CAP and window-less, rely on first-order statistics and provide outputs in the form of activity vectors. In contrast, other methods, such as the clustering method, encode dFC as FC matrices, which are second-order statistics. Additionally, state-free methods generate a continuous sequence of FC matrices over time, while state-based methods generate a set of state FC matrices and a state time course. \n\nComparing dFC methods lacks a general framework. Previous studies that have attempted to compare dFC methods have been limited to specific groups of methods or aspects of dFC. For instance, [ ] compared the results obtained by clustering, CAP, and phase synchrony (PS) converted to a discrete set of states, thus limiting the comparisons to state-based methods. To make the results of CAP method comparable to others, they calculated the outer-product of the state mean-activity vectors obtained by this method to construct the corresponding FC matrices. Their comparison criteria were limited to visual comparison of spatial patterns of FC states and a few statistical outcomes derived from FC states, such as fractional occupancy. Similarly, [ ] compared the results obtained by sliding-window analysis using 10 different correlation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively compared results across the most common dFC assessment methods (state-based and state-free). \n\nTo address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive comparison framework applicable to state-based and state-free methods. This framework compares methods based on spatial, temporal, and overall similarity. We implemented the 7 selected dFC assessment methods in a coherent Python package, providing the first open-source implementation of its kind. The 7 implemented methods were then used to assess dFC using the resting-state fMRI data of 395 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset [ ,  ]. The outputs were standardized into a common array format to allow for comparison of results from methods with different output formats. The resulting dFC arrays were then compared using the comparison framework. This framework employs different similarity metrics, including nonparametric metrics such as Spearman correlation, to deal with the different distributions that result from different dFC methods. This framework was developed to evaluate the variability of the results using 2 levels of comparison, including subject level and intersubject level. Beyond assessing temporal and spatial variability on a subject level, assessing intersubject similarity enabled us to evaluate the ability of methods to capture a common biological phenomenon by examining the consistency of their intersubject correlations. This is particularly relevant for studies focused on identifying population biomarkers. For a complete description of the comparison framework, see \u201cAnalytical Flexibility Assessment\u201d in the Methods and Materials section. \n\nTo support researchers engaged in this endeavor, we implemented our framework as an open-source Python toolbox termed   PydFC  , which simplifies the implementation of multianalysis dFC assessment. The toolbox enables users to apply various dFC assessment methods to their data and experiment with different hyperparameters, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of dFC variability over methods and hyperparameters. Users can compare the results of different methods within a single package, making it easier to explore and evaluate dFC assessment techniques. This toolbox is unique in providing an open-source implementation of commonly used dFC methods and could be a valuable resource for researchers seeking to explore and compare different dFC assessment techniques. The toolbox is available on GitHub [ ] and is designed to be an open and collaborative package (MIT license), where contributors are welcome and the implementation of additional methods can be integrated. \n\nOur findings have important implications for the field of dFC and can guide future studies in several ways. First, by comprehensively comparing 7 widely used dFC assessment methods, we shed light on their analytical flexibility and the variability of their results, particularly when compared to the inherent variability of the biological phenomenon they aim to capture. This understanding is crucial for researchers and practitioners when choosing an appropriate method for their specific research question or clinical application. Second, our study provides a standardized framework for comparing dFC methods, addressing the challenges posed by their diverse assumptions, mathematical foundations, and output formats. This framework, which is implemented as an open-source Python toolbox, can serve as a basis for future comparative studies and facilitate the development and implementation of new or other dFC assessment methods (e.g., [ ,  ]). Lastly, our investigation of intersubject similarity consistency provides insights into the ability of different methods to capture a common biological phenomenon, which is vital for identifying reliable biomarkers of brain function and disorders. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Data \n  \nThe data used in this study are BOLD time series of resting-state fMRI data of 395 young and healthy subjects (age range: 22\u201336\u00a0years) from the S1200 release of the 3T HCP dataset [ ,  ], preprocessed as described in [ ]. Each subject was scanned during 4 sessions on 2 different days. Each day included two 15-minute scans, one acquired with left-to-right (LR) phase encoding direction and the other one with right-to-left (RL). In this study, except the overall similarity matrices, where we use data from all 4 sessions, all other main results are shown using data from the first session   Rest1_LR  . \n\nEach scan consists of 1,200 time points with repetition time   TR  \u00a0=\u00a00.720 seconds.\u00a0The other fMRI acquisition parameters are as follows: sequence: gradient-echo EPI; echo time   TE  \u00a0=\u00a033.1\u00a0ms; flip angle   FA  \u00a0=\u00a052 degrees; field of view   FOV  \u00a0=\u00a0208 \u00d7 180\u00a0mm (RO \u00d7 PE); matrix = 104 \u00d7 90 (RO \u00d7 PE); slice thickness = 2.0\u00a0mm; 72 slices; 2.0-mm isotropic voxels; multiband factor = 8; echo spacing   ES  \u00a0=\u00a00.58\u00a0ms; bandwidth   BW  \u00a0=\u00a02,290\u00a0Hz\/Px (for more details, see [ ]). We used the HCP FIX-denoised data, which include additional denoising steps (i.e., de-trending, head motion correction, and denoising via spatial independent component analysis (ICA) compared to the minimally preprocessed data available in the HCP database) [ ,  ]. Furthermore, the downloaded FIX-denoised volumetric data underwent minimal spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4\u00a0mm [ ]. \n\nThe data were then parcellated into 333 regions of interest (ROIs) using the Gordon parcellation [ ], an atlas widely used in the literature. Each of the ROIs belongs to a specific resting-state network (RSN). Among these 333 ROIs, 47 did not belong to any brain network and therefore were excluded, resulting in 286 ROIs. Additionally, the parcellated data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 0.01\u00a0Hz [ ]. For computational reasons, we have uniformly downsampled these 286 ROIs to 96 ROIs. This downsampling process involved selecting approximately one-third of the ROIs from each RSN in a manner ensuring uniform coverage across the area of that specific RSN and an equal number of ROIs from each hemisphere (see   for a visualization of the selected 96 ROIs). Each ROI time series was   z  -standardized before the analysis. \n\n\n### State-free methods \n  \nThese methods are model free and therefore do not need to be implemented at the group level before dFC assessment. They were applied to each subject separately. See Fig.\u00a0  for an illustration of state-free methods and their dFC matrices. \n\n#### Sliding window (SW) [ ] \n  \nA sliding tapered window of length 44s, or 60 time points (following [ ]), and 50% overlap was used to find the FC of ROI pairs over time. The tapered window was generated by convolving a rectangle of length 44s with a Gaussian curve with \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a03 TRs following [ ] and then moved along 1,200 time points with a 30 time points overlap. This procedure resulted in 38 windows and hence a 38 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI   dFC matrix. The main hyperparameters of this method are window length, overlap ratio, and tapered or rectangular window. The values of these hyperparameters were chosen following [ ]. The overlap ratio of 0.5 was chosen to balance the temporal resolution of dFC assessment and computational demands. \n\n\n#### Time-frequency (TF) [ ] \n  \nThe wavelet transform was performed by applying   k  \u00a0=\u00a0101 wavelet kernels on each ROI time course, resulting in a wavelet time series with   k   frequency scales. Next, the wavelet transform coherence (WTC) was computed between the time courses of each ROI pair for each frequency scale and averaged across all frequency scales following [ ]. The resulting pairwise WTC time courses formed the corresponding dFC matrices of shape 1,200 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . Note that following [ ], only the WTC values outside the cone of influence were considered for the final dFC matrix. The hyperparameters of this method include number of frequency scales, wavelet type, significance level of coherence magnitude, and considering the cone of influence or not. Following [ ], a Morlet wavelet at 101 frequency scales was employed. The significance level was set to 0.95, and only the WTC indices outside the cone of influence were considered. \n\n\n\n### State-based methods \n  \nSince state-based methods assume a finite number of FC states recurring over time and all subjects, they initially need to be applied at a group level to identify the group-level FC states. Each state is represented by a state FC matrix of shape   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  , which corresponds to the FC pattern at the time points that the state occurs. Next, the fitted models are applied to each individual subject, and individual dFC matrices are obtained. Applying the fitted models on subject-level data assigns each time point to one of the group-level FC states, resulting in a state time course. The state FC matrix of each state is then placed at the time points that belong to that state to build the dFC matrix of that subject. There is still no consensus on the number of brain states. In this study, to make the results more comparable, the number of FC states was assumed to be 12 for all state-based methods following [ ].   through   show the state FC matrices obtained by each state-based method. See Fig.\u00a0  for an illustration of state-based methods and their state FC matrices and state time courses. \n\n#### Coactivation patterns (CAP) [ ] \n  \nThe CAP method is a point-process analysis with individual time point time resolution and very few assumptions. The original CAP method used activation thresholding within a seed region and subsequent averaging of the BOLD time series at significant time points [ ]. The original method does not directly yield dFC matrices. The extended version of CAP analysis [ ] applies   k  -means clustering directly to BOLD time series. In the present study, for computational reasons, the clustering was performed in 2 stages following a process similar to [ ]. First, we clustered the time points of each subject (vectors of   length  \u00a0=\u00a0  ROI  ) to find subject-level cluster centroids. Next, we clustered the resulting cluster centroids from all subjects to identify 12 group-level cluster centroids, corresponding to 12 FC states. Finally, we obtained the state FC matrices following the implementation proposed by [ ], by calculating the   ROI   \u00d7   ROI   outer-product matrix of centroids with themselves. The clustering labels of time points were considered the state time courses. The shape of the final dFC matrix was 1,200 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The hyperparameters of this method are the number of subject-level clusters and the number of FC states. The number of subject-level clusters was set to 20 based on [ ]. \n\n\n#### Sliding window + clustering (SWC) [ ] \n  \nThis method relies on the dFC matrix assessed using the sliding-window method. Therefore, we initially assessed the dFC matrix using the sliding-window method as described above, which had a shape of 38 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . Next, we considered each time point of the dFC matrix as a sample and vectorized it to a feature vector of length   ROI   \u00d7 (  ROI   \u2212 1)\/2. Then, using a 2-level   k  -means clustering procedure similar to the one described for the CAP method, we clustered feature vectors into 12 clusters corresponding to 12 FC states. The FC matrix of each state was then obtained by reshaping the centroid vectors to their original shape of   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The resulting clustering label sequences were considered the state time courses. The shape of the final dFC matrix was 38 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The hyperparameters of this method are, in addition to the hyperparameters of the sliding-window method, the number of subject-level clusters, as well as the number of FC states. The values for sliding-window hyperparameters were chosen as in the sliding-window method, and the number of subject-level clusters was set to 20, consistent with the CAP method. \n\n\n#### Continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM) [ ] \n  \nIn this method, a continuous hidden Markov model (continuous HMM or CHMM) with a Gaussian observation model was used. BOLD time series from resting-state fMRI data were directly used as the continuous observation sequences of the HMM. Subsequently, 12 hidden states were identified, each corresponding to a FC state. Each hidden state was represented by a multivariate Gaussian model. The mean and covariance of each hidden state were inferred by fitting the model on the concatenated BOLD time series of all subjects. Next, the fitted model was applied on the subject-level data to infer the sequence of hidden states for each subject. The inferred sequence was then used as the state time course, and the covariance matrix of each hidden state was considered the corresponding state FC matrix. The shape of the final dFC matrix was 1,200 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The only hyperparameters of this method are the observation model type (e.g., Gaussian, or autoregressive) and number of FC states. A Gaussian model was chosen as the observation model following [ ]. \n\n\n#### Discrete hidden Markov model (DHMM) [ ] \n  \nFor this method, a discrete hidden Markov model (discrete HMM or DHMM) with a categorical observation model was used. Since this method is based on the results of the clustering method, we initially assessed dFC matrices using the clustering method, which had a shape of 38 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The number of FC states assumed for this initial clustering analysis was equal to the number of observations assumed for the discrete HMM method and not the number of final FC states. Furthermore, the DHMM used here requires a discrete observation sequence. Therefore, the state time courses obtained by the clustering method were used as the discrete observation sequences of the discrete HMM. The HMM was then fitted to the observation sequences to identify 12 hidden states corresponding to the 12 FC states. The resulting hidden state sequences were used as the state time courses, and the FC matrix of each FC state was obtained by averaging all FC matrices assigned to that FC state in the dFC matrices obtained by the clustering method. The shape of the final dFC matrix was 38 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The hyperparameters of this method include the hyperparameters of the clustering method, number of observations assumed in the observation model, and number of FC states. For the clustering method hyperparameters, the same values as the clustering method were chosen, and the number of observations to number FC states ratio, 16\/24, was adopted from [ ]. \n\n\n#### Window-less (WL) [ ] \n  \nThis method relies on estimating the dominant linear patterns in the sample space of all BOLD time-series values. Each dominant linear pattern corresponds to one of the FC states. To estimate the dominant linear patterns, a sparse dictionary learning algorithm, the   k-SVD   algorithm [ ], was applied to the group-level data. Dominant linear patterns are each represented by a dictionary element. The 12 dictionary elements corresponding to the 12 FC states were stored in the dictionary matrix   D  . Each time point was approximated by a linear combination of these dictionary elements. The coefficients of the linear combinations for each time point were stored in rows of the mixing matrix   M  . A hard sparsity constrain was applied to the algorithm so that it assigns one and only one dictionary to each time point, suggesting that rows of   M   were sparse. The state FC matrices were obtained by calculating the outer-product matrices of the dictionary elements in the columns of   D  . The state time course was calculated using the mixing matrix   M  . The shape of the final dFC matrix was 1,200 \u00d7   ROI   \u00d7   ROI  . The only hyperparameter of this method is the number of FC states. \n\n\n\n### Analytical flexibility assessment \n  \nWe used Python to implement all 7 methods and estimate the dFC matrix for each of the 395 preprocessed fMRI subjects\u2019 data, resulting in a total of 2,765 dFC matrices. Fig.\u00a0  shows representative dFC matrices obtained by different methods using the BOLD data of 1 subject. To ensure comparability, as sliding window\u2013 based methods (SW, SWC, and DHMM) downsample the time samples, the dFC matrices of other methods were uniformly downsampled prior to further analysis to match the resolution of the sliding window\u2013based methods. The output of each method was converted to a common format of a 38 \u00d7 96 \u00d7 96 dFC matrix, resulting in 7 dFC matrices of the same size per subject. This resulted in a dFC results array of dimensions   dFC   (  subject, method, time, ROI, ROI  ) \u2208 (395, 7, 38, 96, 96). The dFC results array was also reshaped in some cases to   dFC   (  subject, method, time, functionalConnection  ) \u2208 (395, 7, 38, 4560) by vectorizing the lower triangle of 2-dimensional FC matrices of shape   ROI   \u00d7   ROI   into   functionalConnection   \u00d7 1. To assess the analytical flexibility of the dFC results across methods, we calculated the 7 \u00d7 (7 \u2212 1)\/2 pairwise similarity using several similarity metrics, including Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, Euclidean distance, and mutual information. We evaluated the similarity between each pair of methods in terms of correlation of their dFC matrices   dFC   (  subject, method  , :, :, : ) (overall similarity), time courses of functional connections   dFC   (  subject, method, :, ROI, ROI  ) (temporal similarity), FC patterns at each time point   dFC   (  subject, method, time  , :, : ) (spatial similarity), and graph properties such as degree and clustering coefficient (see   and  ). The equations\u00a0used to calculate each of these similarity metrics are as follows: \n\nAdditionally, we compared the correspondence between the intersubject correlations of different methods to obtain the intersubject similarity: \n\nTo identify groups of methods that produce similar results, we used hierarchical clustering with the Ward method to analyze the similarity values calculated using the aforementioned metrics (Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, Euclidean distance, and mutual information). For correlation-based metrics, 1 \u2212   correlation   was used as the distance between the methods. The hierarchical clustering allowed us to summarize the measured similarity matrices and, moreover, group together methods that exhibited a higher degree of similarity. \n  \nA sample segment of dFC matrices of 1 subject obtained by the implemented methods: each row shows the dFC matrix obtained by each method, and each column corresponds to a time point, or TR index. Each FC matrix has a size of   ROI   \u00d7   ROI   and ROIs are divided into 12 RSNs. To account for the different value distributions of each method and better comparability, the dFC matrices were normalized by ranking the values, similar to the approach used when calculating Spearman correlation. \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### DFC assessment methods can be grouped into 3 categories based on the similarity of their results \n  \nFigure\u00a0  shows the overall similarity obtained by Spearman correlation of the subject-specific dFC matrices computed using the 7 selected methods (an illustration of sample dFC matrices obtained by each method can be seen in Fig.\u00a0 ). The correlation values were averaged over subjects and repeated for each session, as indicated in equation\u00a0  (for results obtained by other metrics, see Supplementary material: Pearson correlation,  ; Euclidean distance,  ; and mutual information,  ; see   for the results of 2-way ANOVA test on the effect of session [day and direction] on the overall similarity values). Correlation values show a range from weak to strong similarity between dFC methods. The average Spearman similarity of all pairs over all subjects was 0.38, indicating a moderate degree of similarity. However, the corresponding standard deviation was high (0.18; variance: 0.032), about half of the average similarity value. This variability was also significantly larger than the average variance of pairwise similarities over subjects (SD: 0.076, variance: 0.0058). In other words, dFC similarity variability over method pairs was 5 times higher than over subjects. \n  \nSimilarity between dFC patterns obtained from the 7 examined methods as assessed by Spearman correlation. (A) The overall (combined spatial and temporal) similarity values averaged over subjects exhibit considerable variation over different method pairs for all sessions. (B\u2013E) Hierarchical clustering based on (B) average overall similarity, obtained by comparing the entire dFC matrices; (C) average spatial similarity, obtained by comparing FC matrices at each time point; (D) average temporal similarity, obtained by comparing time courses of each functional connection; and (E) average intersubject similarity, obtained by comparing intersubject correlation values, measured by Spearman correlation. The hierarchical clustering results suggest that the methods can be grouped into 3 groups: (i) clustering, continuous HMM, and discrete HMM: orange; (ii) CAP and Window-less: red; and (iii) sliding window and time-frequency: green. The horizontal dashed lines represent the clustering cutoff values. A slightly different pattern was obtained through temporal similarity assessment, which is due to decreased similarity of continuous HMM and time-frequency with the methods in their group. The general similarity between the methods was relatively low, particularly for intergroup comparisons. For results obtained by other metrics, see Supplementary material: Pearson correlation,  ; Euclidean distance,  ; and mutual information,  . \n  \nWe used hierarchical clustering analysis on the pairwise similarity matrices to investigate and summarize variation between dFC methods. The hierarchical clustering based on these average correlation matrices (Fig.\u00a0 ) suggests that the methods can be classified into 3 groups: (i) clustering, continuous HMM, and discrete HMM; (ii) CAP and window-less; and (iii) sliding window and time-frequency. To obtain these groups, we applied a cutoff value equal to 0.7 \u00d7 the maximum distance (Ward distance) observed between different clusters (shown as a horizontal dashed line in the hierarchical clustering figures). While the definition of these groups depends on the specific clustering cutoff value used, our observations revealed pronounced intragroup similarities and comparatively lower intergroup similarities for these 3 identified groups (for results obtained by other metrics, see Supplementary material: Pearson correlation,  ; Euclidean distance,  ; and mutual information,  ). Most subjects exhibited the same hierarchical clustering pattern as the one observed in the average pattern across all subjects ( ). \n\nThe distribution of these similarity patterns over subjects ( ) indicates that the similarity between certain pairs of methods, notably those involving time-frequency, displays greater variability over subjects. This observation suggests that the observed similarity between these methods is more likely influenced by individual differences in BOLD signals than mathematical similarity of their analyses. In other words, the variation in similarity across subjects implies that individual-specific characteristics may play an important role in the similarity between these methods. However, for other pairs of methods, more consistent similarity profiles were observed over subjects. \n\n\n### Similarity in spatial patterns of dFC results follows the overall similarity patterns \n  \nThe spatial similarity between the dFC matrices obtained from different methods was estimated using Spearman correlation between their corresponding spatial patterns (FC matrices) at each time point for each subject (see equation\u00a0 ). The resulting spatial similarity was then averaged over both time and subjects. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the average spatial similarity matrix (see Fig.\u00a0 ) revealed the same hierarchical structure as the one revealed by average overall similarity. The clustering analysis identified the same 3 groups, suggesting that their spatial similarities follow the same intra- and intergroup pattern. \n\n\n### Across methods dFC assessments reveal lower temporal similarity compared to spatial similarity \n  \nThe temporal similarity between dFC matrices of each pair of methods was assessed using Spearman correlation between the time courses obtained by the methods for each functional connection (see equation\u00a0 ). The resulting temporal similarity matrices were then averaged over functional connections (  ROI   \u00d7   ROI  ) and subjects. While 2 methods may produce dFC matrices that have similar spatial patterns, the corresponding temporal patterns may differ. Across methods, spatial similarity focuses on the spatial patterns and values of functional connections at a given time, while temporal similarity focuses on the consistency of the time evolution of dFC for each functional connection. The hierarchical clustering based on the average over subjects\u2019 temporal similarity matrix (Fig.\u00a0 ) reveals an overall decrease in similarity between methods compared to spatial (and overall) similarity. This was particularly noticeable for the similarities between CHMM and TF with other methods in their groups, which yielded considerably lower temporal similarity compared to the corresponding spatial similarity. This suggests that although CHMM and TF exhibit similar spatial patterns to the methods in their groups, they do not exhibit equally similar temporal dynamics (see   and  ). \n\n\n### Intersubject similarities reflect the previously observed overall similarity patterns \n  \nTo assess an intersubject similarity between methods, dFC matrices estimated by each method were used to measure intersubject correlations (  values) (see equation\u00a0 ). The intersubject values obtained for each method were then compared and the similarity between methods was measured using Spearman correlation (see equation\u00a0 ). The resulting correlation values (Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating intersubject correlation correspondence between methods, revealed the same 3 groups of methods in terms of their similarity. This implies that if one method identifies 2 subjects as similar based on their dFC patterns, it is more likely that another method from the same group will also identify those 2 subjects as similar. This finding suggests that the methods grouped together not only demonstrated similarity in capturing subject-level patterns but also exhibited consistency in capturing intersubject patterns. For results obtained using fractional occupancy (FO) as the feature used for assessing the intersubject correlations, see  . \n\n\n### The variability over method is comparable to the variability over time for most functional connections \n  \nThe variance of dFC,   dFC   (  subject, method, time, functionalConnection  ), was calculated over time and method, across functional connections and subjects. To account for the different value distributions of each method, the dFC matrices for each subject,   dFC   (  subject  ,   method  ,   time, functionalConnection  ), were normalized by ranking the values, similar to the approach used when calculating Spearman correlation. We calculated variance over time,   var   (  dFC   (  subject, method, :, functionalConnection  )), averaging over method, and the variance over method,   var   (  dFC   (  subject, :, time, functionalConnection  )), averaging over time. Therefore, both calculations resulted in an array of   subject   \u00d7   functionalConnection   values (1 \u201ctemporal variance\u201d and 1 \u201cmethods variance\u201d value per functional connection and per subject). The results, shown in Fig.\u00a0 , indicate that the variation over dFC methods was comparable to the variation over time for most functional connections and subjects, leading to an average ratio of   var  \/  var  \u00a0=\u00a00.95, or an average ratio of   SD  \/  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.97. For the variability of the results obtained across method pairs and method groups, see   and  . Moreover, Fig.\u00a0  highlights the pair of RSNs with functional connections that exhibited higher variability over method than over time. These functional connections mainly include connections between the default mode and other networks, such as parieto-occipital, frontoparietal, salience, cingulo-opercular, medial-parietal, dorsal attention, and ventral attention networks, as well as most intranetwork connections, with the exception of the cingulo-opercular network. \n  \n(A) A scatterplot of the variance over methods versus the variance over time for each functional connection and each subject (  subj   \u00d7 (  ROI   \u00d7 (  ROI   \u2212 1)\/2) points in total) indicates that the variance over dFC methods is comparable to the variance over time, with an average ratio of   var  \/  var  \u00a0=\u00a00.95 (  SD  \/  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.97). (B) Ratios of variance over method divided by variance over time across functional connections averaged over subjects. The ratios were subtracted by 1 (  ratio   \u2212 1) so that zero values (white) correspond to equal variance over method and time. The current figure\u00a0highlights resting-state network (RSN) pairs with functional connections that are more variable over method than time (red) and those more variable over time than method (blue). The variance values corresponding to functional connections belonging to each pair of RSNs were averaged to yield a single variance value prior to computing the ratios. The plot shows that the functional connections between RSNs (such as the frontoparietal and ventral attention networks) exhibited equal variance values over time and method, while the functional connections between RSNs (such as the default mode and parieto-occipital, as well as default mode and frontoparietal networks) and most intranetwork connections exhibited higher variation over method than over time. \n  \nWe also compared the variability over method with the variability over subject. After normalizing the dFC matrices by ranking their values, we calculated the variance over method,   var   (  dFC   (  subject, :, time, functionalConnection  )), averaging over time and subject, and the variance over subject,   var   (  dFC   (:,   method, time, functionalConnection  )), averaging over time and method. Both calculations resulted in an array of   functionalConnection   values. This yielded an average ratio of   var  \/  var  \u00a0=\u00a00.90, or an average ratio of   SD  \/  SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.94 (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### The variability observed in dFC assessment encourages multianalysis studies \n  \nIn the present study, our main aim was to assess the analytical flexibility of dFC assessment methods. One of the primary challenges of comparing dFC assessment methods is the lack of a biological reference to determine the significance of the observed variability over methods. While no clear biological reference exists for resting-state fMRI data, we compared the assessed variability over methods with connection variation over time as well as intersubject variability. The results (Fig.\u00a0  and  ) suggest that the variance over methods is on average 0.95 of the variance over time and 0.90 of the variance over subjects. These findings indicate that changing the assessment method may lead to a dFC value that is on average as different as a dFC value obtained at another time point or from another subject using the same method. Moreover, although these biological scales may not be appropriate for every situation, they still can serve as a valid point of reference. Specifically, in the case of comparison with temporal variability, the variation of dFC over time is the main biological phenomenon that the dFC methods aim to measure. These results indicate the variation due to the choice of methodology has an impact as large as the scale of the underlying biological phenomenon of interest. \n\nFor further investigation of the analytical flexibility, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of the dFC estimates obtained by different methods using the following approaches: (i) subject-wise comparison of dFC matrices in terms of overall similarity (Fig.\u00a0 ), (ii) time point-wise comparison of FC matrices in terms of their spatial similarity (Fig.\u00a0 ), (iii) functional connection-wise comparison of time courses in terms of their temporal similarity (Fig.\u00a0 ), and (iv) comparison in terms of intersubject correlation similarity (Fig.\u00a0 ). Our similarity analysis identified 3 groups of methods in terms of the similarity of the obtained dFC patterns. The examined methods, while exhibiting fair intragroup similarities, exhibited considerable intergroup variability. \n\nThe identified intra- and intergroup similarity profiles can be largely attributed to the underlying assumptions of the examined methods. For example, both WL and CAP disregard the temporal ordering of the BOLD data, allow for instantaneous reconfiguration of FC states, and do not impose a locality assumption. These assumptions enable them to capture more rapid reconfigurations in FC patterns. Conversely, SWC, CHMM, and DHMM, take into account the temporal ordering of the data and assume locality of neighboring time points, resulting in smoother changes over time (see  ). These assumptions allow these methods to accurately quantify the temporal dependencies between FC patterns at different time points and the slower dynamics of FC. Lastly, SW and TF do not assume the presence of recurring group-level FC patterns, which allows them to capture the individual subject variability to a greater extent. See Table\u00a0  for a summary of the assumptions of each method. These assumptions are rarely invoked in the literature applying dFC technique in a specific study. \n\nThe patterns of similarity observed in this study do not imply the superiority of any dFC assessment method or group of methods. Instead, they reveal 3 groups of methods, each characterized by their specific assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages. These results show that a single analysis or group of analyses may not capture the richness of dFC and that the use of multiple methods from different groups may reveal different features of dFC. In this regard, developing specialized tools to facilitate the conjoint use of multiple dFC methods, such as the one developed in this study, will aid to fully characterize dFC. For instance, by using one method from the SWC, CHMM, and DHMM group; one from the WL and CAP group; and one from the SW and TF group, one can capture rapid FC patterns, as well as temporal dependencies of FC patterns, and subject-specific information. \n\nThis approach is particularly important when classifying subjects based on features derived from dFC, as shown in our intersubject similarity results (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found that using methods from 2 different groups (e.g., CAP and SWC) can lead to different intersubject similarity patterns, consequently leading to different clusters of subjects. Hence, we recommend that clustering is performed using multiple methods from different groups. This can help uncover meaningful subgroups or relationships that may not be apparent when using a single method and ensure that the identified clusters are not solely dependent on the choice of a specific method. \n\n\n### Understanding temporal complexity in dynamic functional connectivity assessment: what lies behind the variations in dynamic functional connectivity? \n  \nEvaluating the overall similarity among the outcomes of various methods offers a perspective on the intermethod similarity relationships. However, it remains unclear to what extent these similarities can be attributed to the spatial and temporal aspects of dFC. Based on our results, in most cases, while the spatial comparison of dFC patterns obtained by different methods (Fig.\u00a0 ) exhibited strong similarity between methods, the comparison in terms of temporal dynamics exhibited moderate similarity (Fig.\u00a0 ). Even the methods with the highest spatial similarity, SWC and DHMM, showed low similarity in the time domain. This suggests that capturing the temporal variations of FC may be more challenging than capturing the spatial patterns of dFC.   shows that although methods having higher spatial similarity are more likely to have higher temporal similarity, the level of temporal similarity is smaller than the level of spatial similarity in most cases. CHMM, as a particular example, exhibited a high spatial similarity with SWC and DHMM but a low temporal similarity with these methods (also supported by   showing the similarity of intertime correlations). \n\nOur supplementary material results suggest that in several cases, pairs of methods did not exhibit a significantly greater similarity compared to the similarity obtained when the dFC matrices were randomly shuffled with respect to time ( ; note that the fractional occupancy of the states was preserved for the shuffled dFC matrices). Pairs of methods exhibiting strong similarity between their time-shuffled dFC matrices indicate that the average similarity between all pairs of their spatial patterns, or FC matrices, even at different time points, is high. For instance, CHMM-SWC exhibited a relatively high overall similarity, but their similarity did not change significantly when the dFC matrices were time-shuffled. This implies that the dFC matrices of CHMM and SWC did not exhibit more consistency in terms of their patterns of variation over time than the time-shuffled dFC matrices and that the observed strong similarity between them was mostly a result of the strong similarity between their spatial patterns. On the other hand, WL-CAP, despite having a low overall similarity, showed significantly greater similarity when compared to the shuffled-time similarity distribution. This implies that their temporal variations exhibited more consistent patterns than those of the time-shuffled dFC matrices, indicating that their low overall similarity was caused by low similarity of their spatial patterns. These observations highlight that the variability in the dFC results may spread differently across the temporal and spatial dimensions, and strong similarity in one dimension does not necessarily imply similarity for the other dimension. It also suggests that comparing the overall similarity of dFC results or comparing only their spatial patterns may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the relation between methods. \n\nFuture research should conduct more in-depth comparisons of dFC assessment methods, focusing on the temporal dynamics of their outputs, to shed light on the reason for the observed variability over methods. This is crucial, as temporal dynamics play a significant role in dFC and have already been a source of controversy regarding their origins. Our results suggest that a part of these temporal variations may originate from the methodology used for assessing them. \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that physiological factors, such as respiration, cardiac activity, and motion artifacts, also modulate the temporal variations of dFC [ ,  ]. These nonneural sources of variability can confound the interpretation of dFC patterns and potentially lead to erroneous conclusions. Future research could develop advanced techniques, including denoising algorithms, physiological signal regression, and data-driven approaches, to effectively isolate the neural-driven part of dFC variations from the physiological sources. By disentangling these sources, researchers could gain a more precise understanding of the genuine neural dynamics underlying dFC, enhancing the reliability of dFC studies and their potential applications in clinical diagnostics and treatment evaluations. \n\n\n### Study limitations and future directions \n  \nPotential future work should review external validation techniques and develop a validation framework to assess the accuracy of dFC assessments in more controlled paradigms, such as predicting cognitive state of the subjects, using simulated data, and assessing the consistency of the result with the neural activation patterns derived from simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. Evaluating the dFC assessment methods using such paradigms will lead to a better understanding of the reasons behind the observed variability between the results yielded by different dFC methods. Furthermore, it would shed light on the varying levels of method variability observed across different RSNs by identifying the factors that contribute to higher variability in certain RSN pairs compared to others. Our hypothesis is that the distinct signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) among the BOLD signals of different RSNs (e.g., due to varying susceptibility to physiological signals) could contribute to this observation [ ]. For instance, the default mode network (DMN) encompasses highly vascular areas and regions that are part of the central autonomic network [ ,  ], and this can lead to a different level of SNR and therefore methodological variability in DMN compared to other networks. Moreover, the pronounced time-varying connectivity patterns of the DMN, potentially arising from its role as a relay between different networks [ ,  ], challenge methods aiming to accurately capture FC dynamics, thereby leading to larger methodological variability. However, a comprehensive interpretation and validation of these hypotheses require further investigation through simulation studies and controlled paradigms. Additionally, using such paradigms would also provide a more reliable biological reference for quantifying the magnitude of the observed methods\u2019 variability. One of the limitations of the current study is the lack of a clear biological reference. The nature of resting-state data makes it challenging to establish expected patterns or variations in dFC over time or across subjects. This is primarily because subjects are free to engage in any mental activity during the resting state [ ,  ]. In contrast, controlled paradigms, such as the ones mentioned earlier, involve specific instructions or tasks, resulting in more deterministic dFC patterns. For instance, in task-based paradigms, subjects perform specific tasks, leading to more comparable dFC patterns and enhanced interpretability of intersubject variability. Similarly, simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiological recordings can provide a more reliable biological reference through the integration of electrophysiological activity. Therefore, future work should prioritize the use of such paradigms to facilitate the utilization of more interpretable biological references. \n\nIt is worth noting that in our study, we adopted the hyperparameter values recommended by the original study or consensus among the community for each method, which may contribute to the observed variability in our results. Different hyperparameter choices could lead to different similarity patterns among methods and varying levels of variability. Therefore, future work should also investigate the sensitivity of dFC assessment results to the choice of hyperparameters and their effect on the observed variability. \n\nAssessing the robustness of neuroscience results with respect to dFC analytical flexibility should be strongly recommended. We propose the utilization of multianalysis approaches, preferably using methods that show less similar results, for assessing dFC and reporting a more comprehensive view of the data, made easier with the Python toolbox released with this article. While the use of several methods may cause interpretation and statistical challenges, assessing the variability of the results is important. As this may not always be feasible, it is also reasonable to select a single dFC method based on the specific research objectives, method strengths and limitations, compatibility with the study design, and data characteristics. \n\nWhile this study does not permit unequivocal recommendations regarding an optimal methodology, given the absence of a clear ground truth, researchers may adopt a pragmatic approach by considering the assumptions and individual properties outlined for each method in alignment with their specific analytical needs. For example, given the relatively similar results produced by WL and CAP, one might favor WL over CAP due to its significantly shorter computation time (refer to  ). The choice between methods such as SWC and DHMM, given their similar results, depends on the preference for implementation complexity; SWC may be preferred for simplicity, while DHMM offers a more comprehensive assessment. In cases where the dependency between time points is a critical consideration, selecting a method from the SWC-CHMM-DHMM group or the SW-TF group is advisable over a method from the WL-CAP group, while in the cases where capturing rapid transitions of FC is critical, choosing a method from the WL-CAP group may be insightful (refer to Table\u00a0  and  ,  , and  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the present study aimed to evaluate the analytical flexibility of dFC measurement methods and establish how analytical flexibility compares to biological variability. The comparison results show a wide range of similarity patterns across methods. The variability found in the results highlights the importance of carefully motivating and validating the choice of a specific dFC assessment method. The use of multiple methods would mitigate the issues arising from analytical flexibility and better characterize the richness of dFC measurements. Future work should aim to develop a validation framework and evaluate the accuracy of dFC assessments through external validation techniques. \n\n\n## Availability of Source Code and Requirements \n  \n PydFC   is an open-source toolbox available on GitHub [ ].

However, recent focus has shifted to cognitive deficits as a crucial aspect. The cerebellum, conventionally tied to motor coordination, is now recognized as pivotal in the pathophysiology of SZ cognitive impairments. Proposed disruptions in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortico circuit contribute to these deficits. Despite evidence of cerebellar abnormalities, within-cerebellum functional connectivity is often overlooked. This study explores spontaneous functional interactions within the cerebellum and their link to cognitive deficits in SZ. Using a multi-domain task battery (MDTB) parcellation, fMRI data from SZ patients and healthy controls were analyzed. Significant differences in cerebellar connectivity emerged, particularly in regions related to attention, language, and memory processing. Correlations between connectivity values and SZ symptomatology were identified. A post hoc analysis, considering the patients\u2019 hallucination vulnerability, revealed distinct connectivity patterns. Non-hallucinating and low-hallucinating SZ patients exhibited higher cerebellar connectivity than high-hallucinating patients, especially in language and motor control regions. These findings suggest a gradient of cerebellar connectivity alterations corresponding to hallucination vulnerability in SZ patients. This study offers novel insights into cerebellar impairments in SZ, highlighting the role of within-cerebellum connectivity in cognitive deficits. The observed connectivity patterns in language-related regions contribute to understanding language development and auditory verbal hallucinations in SZ. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 20 million individuals worldwide [ ]. This condition is associated with heterogeneous and extensive impairments that strongly affect quality of life, general health, functioning, and subjective well-being [ ]. Being considered for many years the archetype of psychotic illness [ ], SZ diagnostic characterization has been primarily traced to the presence of positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and\/or negative symptoms (e.g., affective flattening, social withdrawal), which consequently became the main target for research and treatment [ , ]. However, the presence of a third core symptoms category in SZ has been more recently established and has gained clinical and research relevance: cognitive deficits [ ]. Their key role in SZ has been identified following the increasing evidence in favor of their independent etiology. Cognitive deficits do not merely result from positive or negative symptoms, and their emergence can only be partially ascribed as side effects of treatment [ ]. Notably, epidemiological data show that most SZ patients suffer from a prominent neurocognitive impairment [ ] and that, compared to healthy people, their average level of overall cognitive functioning is approximately two standard deviations lower [ ], especially in the domains of attention, executive functioning, processing speed, social cognition, and working, verbal, and visual memory [ ]. \n\nAmong the putative brain regions that seem to play a key role in the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in SZ [ ], the cerebellum has gained particular interest mainly due to the reconceptualization of its involvement in cognition [ ]. Indeed, the last decades of research have shown that the cerebellum, in addition to its well-known role in motor coordination [ ], is involved in cognitive performance [ ]. Therefore, the disruption of its functioning, occurring in various neurological [ ] and psychiatric conditions, foremost SZ [ ], might lead to cognitive deficits. Nancy Andreasen\u2019s work has been crucial to highlight the cerebellar dysfunction characterizing SZ: starting from positron emission tomography (PET) evidence showing that SZ patients had significantly reduced cerebral blood flow in cerebellar, thalamic, and prefrontal areas during cognitive tasks compared to healthy individuals [ ], Andreasen and colleagues hypothesized that the well anatomically described cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortico circuit (CCTCC) [ ], when altered, could be the neurobiological source of cognitive deficits in SZ patients [ ]. This founds the basis of the \u201ccognitive dysmetria theory\u201d, which states that, in a physiological condition, cerebellum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex fluidly collaborate to orchestrate cognitive abilities\u2014similarly to how motor activities are sustained\u2014and when this loop is disrupted, cognitive dysmetria might arise, resulting in difficulty coordinating different cognitive functions and leading to a multitude of deficits in individuals with this disorder [ ]. In a subsequent publication focusing on the role of the cerebellum in SZ, Andreasen suggested the importance of cerebellum malfunctioning as a possible etiopathogenetic explanation of cognitive symptoms in this disorder. Still, their investigation focused on the cerebellum in relation to its long-range connections and involvement with cortical regions [ ] rather than local communication within the cerebellum itself. In particular, the opposite contributions\u2014inhibitory and excitatory\u2014of the Purkinje and the granule cells, respectively, appeared critical to modulate and\/or coordinate cortical activity. Furthermore, the structural and functional connections of the Purkinje cells of cerebellum are significantly involved in the processing of specific input, e.g., detection of changes in spatial location or in auditory stimulation [ ]. With their inhibitory effect, these fibers mediate which information should be returned to the cortex. A deficiency of Purkinje cells\u2019 inhibitory effects might contribute to misinterpretations of sensory stimuli, leading to psychotic symptoms [ , , ]. \n\nEvidence of abnormalities in the CCTCC across SZ patients with cognitive impairments has been reported over the past decades [ , ], highlighting cerebellar structural anomalies, e.g., references [ , ], as well as structural and functional cortico-cerebellar connectivity alterations, e.g., references [ , , ], in these patients. Nevertheless, while findings accounting for cerebellar abnormalities are consistent from some perspectives, such as neurological soft signs and posture, they are highly heterogeneous from others, including cognition [ ]. In addition, the functional connectivity within the cerebellum itself has often been neglected. Several studies carried out on healthy participants have demonstrated the involvement of the cerebellum in a wide range of cognitive domains, including\u2014among others\u2014motor functions, attention, language, and memory, which are known to be impaired in SZ, e.g., references [ , , ]. With a multi-domain task battery (MDTB) of 26 tasks and 47 conditions, King et al. (2019) [ ] trained and tested 24 healthy individuals to define the functional specialization of each cerebellar region. Their new comprehensive parcellation of the cerebellar cortex, based on motor, cognitive, and emotional\/affective functions, offers an important tool to investigate cerebellar interactions and identify their relationship with cognition. Thus, by exploring the connectivity among cerebellar subregions and its association with patients\u2019 cognitive profiles, this new atlas may contribute to the definition of the pathophysiological role of the cerebellum in SZ. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate spontaneous functional interactions in the cerebellum and to identify their relationship with cognitive deficits in SZ. To this end, we applied the MDTB parcellation of the cerebellum [ ] to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from SZ patients during the resting state. We examined whether functional connectivity alterations between specific cerebellar regions were associated with this disorder and identified which and to what extent cerebellar functional alterations may underlie SZ cognitive symptoms. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe fMRI data are stored in SchizConnect ( , accessed on 10 February 2021), a public and virtual database for research in neuroimaging. The platform contains data from various databases, including the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE), MCIC (available through the COINS database), Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN), XNAT Central, and NUNDA and Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) frameworks from Northwestern University. Access to such heterogeneous data allows us to conduct large-scale studies, carrying out multi-site, multidimensional, and multimodal analyses. Our data sample of SZ patients and healthy controls (HCs) met the following requirements: (1) availability of resting-state fMRI images data; (2) availability of T1 structural MRI (sMRI) data; and (3) availability of the complete scores of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) [ ] for the SZ sample only. The dataset used in the present study was shared in the domain of the COBRE project, which collects data from psychiatric patients attending the UNM Psychiatric Center, the Raymond G. Murphy Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and other clinics in the Albuquerque metropolitan area (USA). The COBRE project criteria for SZ patient selection were: (1) a SZ diagnosis, confirmed by two different psychiatrists using the DSM-IV Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I disorders (SCID) [ ]; (2) clinical stability, assessed both 3 months before the experimental session and during MRI sessions; and (3) an age between 18 and 65 years old. HCs were also recruited in Albuquerque. To be sure to enroll only healthy adults, strict exclusion criteria based on the SCID-Non Patient administration within the COBRE project were applied, i.e., (1) diagnosis of an ongoing or past Axis I psychiatric disorder; (2) head trauma (with loss of consciousness greater than 5 min); (3) recent history of substance abuse, addiction, or antidepressant use in the past 5 months; (4) having a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder. \n\nAll the participants involved in the COBRE project provided written informed consent. The Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Data Exchange (COINS;  , accessed on 10 February 2021) made data downloading possible. COBRE-funded data collection took place at the Mind Research Network, subject to the licensing procedure 5P20RR021938\/P20GM103472 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to Dr. Vince Calhoun. All the data were anonymized before access to protect the privacy of the participants. Structural and resting-state images were further visually inspected to check for sample suitability. The final dataset consisted of 74 SZ patients and 74 HC, similar for age (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 37.43 \u00b1 14.02 and 37.88 \u00b1 12.69 years, respectively;   t   = 0.20, n.s.) and gender distribution (59 SZ men and 15 SZ women and 54 HC men and 20 HC women;   \u03c7   = 0.93, n.s.). \n\n\n### 2.2. MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens MR scanner (Trio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). In order to obtain image slices that were axial, oblique, and parallel to the antero-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line, the acquisition protocol allowed for sagittal-gradient echo-scout images through the midline. In particular, oblique slices were used to minimize the orbitofrontal susceptibility artifact. fMRI data were collected using a single-shot gradient echo-planar pulse sequence with lipid suppression using the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 29 ms, flip angle = 75\u00b0, FOV = 240 mm, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, 33 slices, voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4.55 mm , number of volumes = 150. In addition, sMRI data (high-resolution T1-weighted) were collected using a multi-echo MP-RAGE sequence (5 echoes) using the following parameters: TE = 1.64, 3.5, 5.36, 7.22, 9.08 ms, TR = 2.53 s, TI = 1.2 s, flip angle = 7\u00b0, NEX = 1, slice thickness = 1 mm, FOV = 256 mm, resolution = 256 \u00d7 256. The first image of each acquisition was removed to account for T1 equilibrium effects. The scanning parameters are described in detail at the following link:   (last accessed on 10 February 2021). \n\n\n### 2.3. MRI Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using an automated pipeline developed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) software ( , accessed on 10 September 2023) in the MATLAB  (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) environment. This pipeline included motion correction, spatial alignment to the structural image, band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1 Hz), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and global signals regression, and spatial smoothing at a 6 mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) [ ]. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on the cerebellar parcellations proposed by King et al. (2019) [ ] ( ). The multi-domain task battery (MDTB) parcellation allowed us to define reliable functional boundaries in the cerebellum. In our study, we used a ten-region parcellation which has been shown to provide a useful level of resolution for full functional characterization [ ]. In their study, King and colleagues identified cognitive descriptors for the 10 functional regions in the MDTB parcellation ( ), which are primarily representative of the following cognitive descriptors: (1) left-hand presses\u20141LH, (2) right-hand presses\u20142RH, (3) saccades\u20143S, (4) action observation\u20144AO, (5) divided attention\u20145DA, (6) divided attention\u20146DA, (7) narrative\u20147N, (8) word comprehension\u20148WC, (9) verbal fluency\u20149VF, and (10) autobiographical recall\u201410AR. \n\n\n### 2.4. fMRI Connectivity Analysis \n  \nWe examined the functional connectivity between different pairs of the 10 ROIs. At the individual level, the time-series across all voxels within each of the 10 ROIs were averaged, and the Pearson correlation coefficients among all the ROIs were computed [ ]. This analysis yielded a 10 \u00d7 10 connectivity matrix. Each correlation coefficient r was converted to z-values using Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation. The fMRI connectivity analysis was first performed by considering both the HC and SZ groups to identify differences in functional connectivity between healthy and pathological populations. To assess differences in connectivity between the two groups, a two-tailed paired   t  -test was performed on the connectivity values for each ROI. The false discovery rate (FDR) method [ ] was used to account for multiple comparisons across ROIs, and the significance level was set to   q   < 0.05. \n\n\n### 2.5. Correlation between fMRI Connectivity Values and PANSS Scores \n  \nTo probe the existence of a relationship between the affective\/cognitive symptoms of SZ and the connectivity in the patients\u2019 cerebella, we computed the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between the PANSS scores and each ROI connectivity value corresponding to each MDTB region. The significance level of the correlations was set to   p   < 0.05 (uncorrected) and to   q   < 0.05 (FDR corrected). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Cerebellar MDTB-Based Connectivity Analysis \n  \nWe found significant differences in the connectivity values between the HC and SZ groups for several ROIs ( A), spanning cerebellar regions linked to attention (5DA), language (8WC and 9VF), and memory processing (10AR). Higher connectivity values were reported for the HC group compared to the SZ group for the 5DA-9VF, 8WC-9VF (FDR corrected), and 9VF-10AR pairs ( B). \n\nWhen exploring the involvement of these specific connections with SZ symptoms, we identified significant negative relationships between the connectivity values of attention- and language-related regions and many items of the General Psychopathology Scale, including the GP2 (anxiety), GP3 (guilt feelings), GP4 (tension), and GP6 (depression) items, as well as a significant positive relationship between 10AR and the N1 item of the PANSS. Correlation plots for all significant correlations are reported in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Post Hoc Cerebellar MDTB-Based Connectivity Analysis of Patient Subgroups \n  \nConsidering the significant, FDR-corrected, decreased connectivity values reported for the SZ group compared to the HC group for the word comprehension (8WC) and verbal fluency (9VF) ROIs, we decided to carry out an additional analysis focused on patient subgroups. Indeed, according to Crow\u2019s hypothesis [ , ], reduced left hemisphere dominance for language represents a risk factor for SZ, and we found evidence of a direct association between altered language lateralization and verbal hallucinations in the SZ patients [ , , ]. Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased connectivity in the cerebellar ROIs engaged in language-related processing, such as 8WC and 9VF, could be reasonably associated with the hallucinatory phenomena of SZ patients. With this in mind, we divided the patient group into three subgroups according to their vulnerability to hallucinate based on the P3 (hallucinatory behavior) item of the PANSS. In particular, the patients in the three subgroups were mutually exclusive, such that if a patient obtained a P3 PANSS score < 3, =3, >3, the patient was assigned to the non-hallucinating (NH,   n   = 28), low-hallucinating (LH,   n   = 17), and high-hallucinating (HH,   n   = 29) subgroups, respectively. To assess differences in connectivity between pairs of subgroups, a two-tailed paired   t  -test was performed for the connectivity values for each ROI so that three contrasts (NH vs. LH, NH vs. HH, and LH vs. HH) were computed. FDR (  q   < 0.05) was used to account for multiple comparisons. A correlation analysis with affective and cognitive symptoms (assessed with the PANSS scale) was also separately performed for each subgroup to identify specific relationships depending on the patients\u2019 vulnerability to hallucinate. The results of this post hoc patient grouping revealed significant differences in the connectivity values between the different SZ subgroups for specific ROIs ( A) including (associative) motor regions (1LH, 3S, and 4AO) and language-related regions (7N, and 9VF). Higher connectivity values were reported for the NH group compared to the HH group for the 3S-4AO (FDR corrected) and 4AO-9VF pairs ( B). Higher connectivity values were reported for the LH group compared to the HH group for the 3S-4AO (similar to the NH and HH comparison, but uncorrected) and 1LH-7N pairs (FDR corrected) ( B). No significant differences were reported between the NH and LH groups. \n\nConsidering the associations of these specific connections with PANSS, we found relatively strong relationships, ranging from \u22120.60 to 0.57 for positive and negative correlations, respectively. In particular, we reported positive associations between 3S-4AO and the GP1 (somatic concern), GP9 (unusual thought content), and P5 (grandiosity) items and negative associations between 1LH-7N and the GP2 (anxiety), GP5 (mannerisms and posturing), and GP14 (poor impulse control) items, depending on the subgroups. Correlation plots for all the significant correlations are reported in  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nA recent study revealed that\u2014beyond its core motor functioning involvement\u2014the cerebellum is engaged in a range of cognitive functions, including attentional processing, language, executive functions, and working memory [ ]. Previous studies have shown a link between altered cortico-cerebellar connectivity in fluid intelligence [ ] and in the processing of error information for performance optimization [ ] in healthy individuals as well as in SZ patients. Still, to the best of our knowledge, within-cerebellum connectivity has not been explored in SZ. In the present study, we addressed this research gap by relying on the MDTB parcellation to gain new insights into cerebellar impairments in SZ and their relation to compromised cognitive functions ( A). We found that, compared with the HC group, the SZ patients exhibited decreased cerebellar connectivity in two regions associated with distinct linguistic functions, i.e., word comprehension (8WC) and verbal fluency (9VF) ( B). Both of these ROIs are located in the lobulus semilunaris inferior of the right cerebellar hemisphere, one next to the other ( ). \n\nReduced left hemisphere dominance for language processing represents a risk factor for SZ [ , ], and altered language lateralization has been widely reported in both SZ, e.g., references [ , , , , , ], as well as other functional psychosis, such as bipolar disorder, e.g., references [ , ]. In line with these findings, decreased connectivity in the cerebellar ROIs engaged in language-related processing, such as 8WC and 9VF, could represent another result supporting the framework of Crow\u2019s model. In addition, recent studies provided evidence of a direct association between bilaterally distributed language lateralization and the severity of verbal hallucinations in SZ patients [ , , ]. For this reason, we posit that the patients\u2019 decreased cerebellar connectivity in word comprehension and verbal fluency ROIs could also be reasonably associated with the hallucinatory phenomena of SZ patients. We therefore carried out a post hoc analysis, considering patient subgroups according to their vulnerability to hallucination, by considering the P3 (hallucinatory behavior) item of the PANSS ( A). Interestingly, no connectivity differences were found when considering the non-hallucinating (NH) and low-hallucinating (LH) patients, whereas both these subgroups revealed significantly higher cerebellar connectivity values when compared with high-hallucinating (HH) SZ patients ( B). We identified a connectivity gradient between the 3S and 4AO regions, as the HH subgroup showed decreased connectivity compared with both the LH (uncorrected) and NH (FDR-corrected) subgroups. These two regions are located in the declive (vermis) and the left lobules biventer (H VIII A, H VIII B) and have been associated, beyond saccadic movements and action observation, with visual letter recognition and visual working memory functions (3S ROI) and motor planning and divided attention tasks (4AO ROI) [ ], respectively. \n\nAltered saccadic eye movements have been consistently found in SZ patients [ ]; therefore, some authors have considered this defect as a possible disease marker [ ]. Interestingly, Subramaniam et al. (2018) [ ] investigated the association between saccadic performance and clinical symptoms in drug-free SZ patients. In particular, compared with healthy controls, SZ patients showed smaller (in amplitude) antisaccades and they made more errors, resulting in more severe hallucinations. Therefore, by describing the relationship between antisaccade errors and hallucination severity, a potential link was identified between hallucinations and deficits in inhibitory control, which, in light of our findings, might lie in altered cerebellar functioning. Interestingly, we found significant differences for cerebellar connections supporting narrative comprehension (region 7), language functions (regions 8 and 9), and autobiographical recall (region 10), which are linked to regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN) such as the left angular gyrus (lAG), which notably is involved in inner speech monitoring [ , ], language [ ], and memory and\/or self-referential [ ] processing. Importantly, alterations in lAG functioning have been reported in SZ and associated with the vulnerability to hallucinate [ , ]. \n\nIn our findings, we reported further differences between the HH groups compared to the ones presenting limited or no vulnerability to hallucination. We found that the LH SZ patients exhibited higher cerebellar connectivity between the 1LH and 7N ROIs compared with the HH patients. These regions, both located in the left cerebellar hemisphere, are involved in motor planning (1LH) and emotion and language processing (7N). Furthermore, the NH SZ patients had higher cerebellar connectivity between the 4AO and 9VF ROIs compared with the HH patients. For this comparison, this also suggests that the SZ patients characterized by a higher vulnerability to hallucinate presented an altered functional interaction between regions involved in motor control and language processing. \n\nAn exploratory direct comparison between the HC group and the SZ subgroups was also performed. This analysis demonstrated that the differences between the HC and the SZ groups were partially ascribed to the HH group ( ), as the 5DA-9VF and 8WC-9VF pairs persisted in the subgroup comparison. At the same time, a strong difference also persisted between the HC and the LH groups for the 8WC-9VF pair. This eventually confirmed the possible key role of these cerebellar regions in the emergence of auditory verbal hallucinations in SZ. Also, the difference in connectivity between the 3S-4AO pair in the HC and HH group comparison (which was also reported for the NH vs. HH and LH vs. HH comparisons) suggests that altered connectivity between these regions might underlie hallucinatory phenomena. While our findings highlight the possible role of the cerebellum in language processing, we cannot state that this evidence could demonstrate a clear correspondence with specific symptoms in schizophrenia, e.g., auditory verbal hallucinations. To this end, further investigations involving dedicated language tasks could clarify the association between cerebellar functioning and clinical symptoms. By investigating the role of cerebellum in language, future studies could provide crucial information to understand the development and\/or to assess the eventual deficits of language-related skills, which applies not only to psychiatric but also to developmental disorders such as dyslexia [ ]. Indeed, dyslexia patients, similarly to SZ, display dysfunctional language lateralization [ ] which might arise from alterations in the interactions within the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and the cortex by involving pathways linked to both motor control and cognitive processing [ , ]. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, in this study, we provided the first evidence that functional connectivity of language-related cerebellar regions is reduced in SZ patients.

The present longitudinal study in GAERS and age-matched non-epileptic controls (NEC) aimed to characterize the epileptic brain network using two functional measures, resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) combined with morphometry, and to investigate potential brain network alterations, following long-term seizure activity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nRepeated rs-fMRI measurements at 9.4\u2009T between 3 and 8\u2009months of age were combined with MEMRI at the final time point of the study. We used graph theory analysis to infer community structure and global and local network parameters from rs-fMRI data and compared them to brain region-wise manganese accumulation patterns and deformation-based morphometry (DBM). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) was generally higher in GAERS when compared to NEC. Global network parameters and community structure were similar in NEC and GAERS, suggesting efficiently functioning networks in both strains. No progressive FC changes were observed in epileptic animals. Network-based statistics (NBS) revealed stronger FC within the cortical community, including regions of association and sensorimotor cortex, and with basal ganglia and limbic regions in GAERS, irrespective of age. Higher manganese accumulation in GAERS than in NEC was observed at 8\u2009months of age, consistent with higher overall rs-FC, particularly in sensorimotor cortex and association cortex regions. Functional measures showed less similarity in subcortical regions. Whole brain volumes of 8\u2009months-old GAERS were higher when compared to age-matched NEC, and DBM revealed increased volumes of several association and sensorimotor cortex regions and of the thalamus. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nrs-fMRI, MEMRI, and volumetric data collectively suggest the significance of cortical networks in GAERS, which correlates with an increased fronto-central connectivity in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Our findings also verify involvement of basal ganglia and limbic regions. Epilepsy-related network alterations are already present in juvenile animals. Consequently, this early condition seems to play a greater role in dynamic brain function than chronic absence seizures. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEpilepsies have long been classified as neurological disorders that can affect the entire brain network ( ). Noninvasive techniques, including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are well-established diagnostic tools for individual assessment and systematic clinical research. Graph theory is an optional analysis strategy that is increasingly utilized for exploring brain network characteristics ( ,  ). \n\nThe majority of clinical studies focus on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is the most common type of epilepsy ( ,  ). TLE is characterized by convulsive seizures that arise from brain lesions caused by stroke, trauma, or tumor growth. Seizure activity, in particular prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) contribute to further neuronal damage ( ). Absence epilepsy, on the other hand, is characterized by transient impairment of consciousness, brief interruption of ongoing activity, and momentary unresponsiveness to the environment. Absence seizures are typically not linked to local macroscopic lesions in the brain, leading absence epilepsies to be regarded as a benign syndrome ( ). However, idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) have been associated with abnormal behavior, cognitive impairment, including attention and memory deficits, language problems, and mood disorders ( ). Because absence epilepsy and its comorbid symptoms mainly affect children and are less severe than convulsive seizures, ethical considerations make clinical studies, especially longitudinal assessments in humans [e.g., ( )], scarce. Furthermore, only few clinical reports relate observed network characteristics to duration of disease. \n\nStandardized study designs can be utilized when working with animal models. Present knowledge is obtained from a wide spectrum of experimental techniques. Two-photon microscopy or local field potential (LFP) recordings can be used to assess neuronal activity, and can be combined with modulation of specific network components, for example using optogenetics or chemogenetics, to identify causal relationship between brain regions ( ). Additionally, electrical recordings in awake animals are well-established. Permanent headmounts enable extended recordings and repeated recording sessions. While challenging, awake MRI in rodents is also possible ( ). However, stress levels during the relatively long and noisy MR examinations may pose a serious obstacle since absence seizures typically occur in a relaxed behavioral state rather than during arousal. Pharmacological restraint, using a low dose of isoflurane, either alone or in combination with medetomidine, has been established for rs-fMRI studies in na\u00efve rodents ( ,  ). However, isoflurane suppresses seizures and only allows for investigating functional connectivity (FC) of epileptic animals in a seizure-free state. Investigating brain networks during seizures has been successfully performed under Neurolept sedation which preserves seizure occurrence [e.g., ( ,  )]. \n\nIn two widely accepted, spontaneous rat models of absence epilepsy: the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and the Wistar Albino Glaxo\/from Rijswijk (WAG\/Rij) ( ,  ) preclinical simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies have identified an epilepsy-specific, bilateral core brain network. In adult animals, this core network comprises somatosensory cortex and related thalamic regions during seizure initiation, generalizing across motor cortex and association cortex during seizures. Basal ganglia regions serve as remote seizure control. The contribution of limbic structures has been noted. These observations are consistent with analysis of rodent electrophysiologic data ( ,  ). \n\nThe present longitudinal study used GAERS and age-matched non-epileptic controls (NEC) and aimed to further characterize the epileptic brain network using two functional measures, rs-fMRI and manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). We started with 3\u2009months-old rats when 100% seizure prevalence in GAERS was expected and performed monthly rs-fMRI examinations up to 8\u2009months of age under low-dose Isoflurane anesthesia, i.e., in a seizure-free state. GAERS experience frequent non-convulsive seizures during 10\u201315% of their time in quiet wakefulness. We were particularly interested whether long-term aberrant brain activity or comorbidities associated with such a pathology would affect brain networks. After the final time point of the longitudinal rs-fMRI investigation at 8\u2009months of age, we performed MEMRI as an alternative approach of evaluating FC. Finally, volumetric differences were assessed through deformation-based morphometry (DBM) on T1-weighted (T1w) 3D data between these 8\u2009months-old GAERS and NEC rats. This approach provided readout of the effects of brain activity over different periods. Temporal synchronicity of regional brain activity (as probed by rs-fMRI) and volume changes (as probed by DBM) have been influenced over the previous life span. MEMRI, on the other hand, only represents differences in regional neuronal activity accumulated during the preceding phase of manganese application (7\u2009days) and is not influenced by anesthesia, which is only necessary during the MRI acquisition. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Animals \n  \nExperiments were performed in line with ARRIVE guide lines with female GAERS (  n  \u2009=\u200912) and NEC (  n  \u2009=\u200912) from the breeding colony of the Institute of Physiology I, University of M\u00fcnster (animal use protocol 84-02.04.2015.A427, Landesamt f\u00fcr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen). Both strains have the same genetic background: they were outbred from Wistar rats, one exhibiting the EEG and behavioural pattern of absence epilepsy (GAERS) and the other being seizure-free (NEC) ( ). In the GAERS, the penetrance and frequency of spike\u2013wave discharges (SWD) does not differ as a function of sex ( ). Rats were housed in groups of two to four animals at 21\u00b0C, controlled relative humidity of 45\u201365%, a 12\/12\u2009h light\/dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. In order to enrich animal\u2019s environment, we used 13 inches high cages with a second level and offered red-transparent plexiglas houses and aspen gnawing sticks. Monthly longitudinal MRI examinations were performed between ages of 3 to 8\u2009months (6 instances). Study design is outlined in  . Prior to each examination, animal body weights were measured ( ). \n  \nStudy design. 12 GAERS and NEC, each, were subjected to repeated rs-fMRI examinations at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8\u2009months of age under low dose isoflurane anesthesia. Graph theory analysis was applied to analyze longitudinal rs-fMRI data. At 8\u2009months of age mini-osmotic pumps prefilled with MnCl x4H O were implanted. Before and after 7\u2009days of continuous manganese application, high-resolution 3D T1w-MRI were acquired. Manganese accumulation was assessed by brain region-wise analysis of signal intensities in T1-weighted images. Regional volume differences between GAERS and NEC were retrieved from data registration. \n    \nGlobal parameters.   (A)   Body weights of GAERS (blue) and NEC (orange) significantly increased between 3 and 5\u2009months of age, followed by a plateau from 6\u2009months and onwards.

Asterisks indicate significant differences between time points (rm ANOVA followed by posthoc Student\u2019s   t  -test, *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01. and ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001).   (C)   Mean correlation coefficients (  z  -transformed) of GAERS and NEC over time.

Asterisks   (F)   indicate significant differences of global parameter lambda between juvenile strains (*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test).

Grey bars highlight density threshold of   k  \u2009=\u20096, which was used for subsequent analyses. All graphs show mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). \n  \n\n### Resting state-fMRI \n  \n#### Animal preparation \n  \nAnimals were anesthetized with 5% Isoflurane (Baxter vet., Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) and positioned in the animal cradle with head fixation via ear plugs and bite bar. During MRI examinations a gas mixture of 75% air and 25% oxygen with 1.1\u20131.2% Isoflurane was supplied via a nose cone. Respiration rate and rectal body temperature were continuously monitored and strictly kept in the physiological range (36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C, 60\u201390 breaths per minute) by adjusting cradle temperature and Isoflurane dose. We paid particular attention to keep the time between initiation of anesthesia and functional scans as short as possible (20\u201330\u2009min). \n\n\n#### Acquisition \n  \nrs-fMRI data were acquired at 9.4\u2009T (Bruker Biospin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) using Paravision 5.1 with a 3-element rat brain surface coil (Rapid Biomedical, Rimpar, Germany) applying a gradient echo-echo planar imaging sequence (GE-EPI) with repetition time TR 1\u2009s, echo time TE 18\u2009ms, resolution 0.33\u2009\u00d7\u20090.35\u2009mm , slice thickness 1.2\u2009mm, 12 contiguous axial slices and 30\u2009min scan time per data set. Slice 5 from caudal was placed across the anterior commissure. Saturation slices were placed around the brain to suppress signal from outside of the brain. Local shimming was accomplished using Mapshim in a volume of 12\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009mm  (anterior\u2013posterior\u2009\u00d7\u2009left\u2013right\u2009\u00d7\u2009rostro\u2013caudal). \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nRaw data were realigned and resliced using SPM12 ( , based on MATLAB 2018b, Mathworks, Natick, MA, United States). The first 15\u2009min of the 30\u2009min raw data were used. In case any shift in rat head position was detected, continuous 15\u2009min epochs with stable translation (<0.2\u2009mm) and rotation (<0.3\u00b0) parameters were selected from 30\u2009min data sets. For data quality assurance, a bilateral cortical ROI in slice 9 was used to estimate temporal Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (tSNR) (GAERS 57\u2009\u00b1\u200910, NEC 56\u2009\u00b1\u200911). Subsequent processing was done using MagnAn (Biocom, Uttenreuth, Germany), a MRI image analysis software based on IDL ( 2020 Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc.). 2D Gaussian smoothing with a kernel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 pixel, full width half max 0.6\u2009mm was applied. Time series were low pass filtered using a Fourier-filter of 0.1\u2009Hz. Brains were manually masked and the global signal mean was regressed out. A template of 80 brain regions ( ) ( , referred to as MagnAn atlas) based on the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas ( ) was semi-automatically registered to each individual dataset (with the Regibox tool provided in MagnAn followed by manual correction). The label mask volumes were taken as a rough estimate for brain volumes ( ). 8\u2009months rs-fMRI data was additionally analyzed using a template with 114 brain regions based on the RatSigma atlas ( ) in order to allow for region-wise comparison with high-resolution MEMRI data acquired at the final time point of the study (see below). The RatSigma atlas subdivides cortex and hippocampus into many subregions but provides only very limited subcategories for the subcortical brain ( ). \n\n\n#### Network construction \n  \nNetwork analysis was performed using MagnAn with a multi seed regions approach (MSRA) ( ). In brief, seed regions were automatically defined in the center of mass of each brain region. The average time course of each seed region was correlated with every voxel time course within the brain and the resulting correlation maps were thresholded using the Benjamini\u2013Yekutieli false discovery rate (FDR), implemented in MagnAn (  q  \u2009=\u20090.05,   n  \u2009=\u20096 time points). The average Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient   r   of all target voxels per brain region was used to define the connectivity strength to the respective seed region. This procedure was repeated for every brain region resulting in an asymmetric correlation matrix 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 (MagnAn atlas) and 114\u2009\u00d7\u2009114 (RatSigma atlas) per resting-state scan. Pearson\u2019s   r  -values were transformed to Fisher\u2019s   z  -values to provide normal distribution and only positive correlations were considered further.   Z  -values of correlation coefficients were initially compared for each time point (  and  ). \n  \nGroup comparisons. \n  \nSummary of rm ANOVA comparing   (A)   FC (  z  -values),   (B)   body weights, and   (C)   brain volumes per strain and time point.   (D)   FC after combining 3, 4, and 5\u2009months data in a juvenile group and 6, 7, and 8\u2009months data in an adult group. \n  \nFor subsequent analyses, we combined data from 3\u20135\u2009months (juvenile) and 6\u20138\u2009months (adult) based on animal body weights. Averaged group correlation matrices of juvenile and adult GAERS and NEC are displayed in  . The clearly visible diagonals, representing the interhemispheric connections between regions, indicate that the analysis established meaningful functional connections, despite anatomical distance. Robust interhemispheric connectivity was observed at a significance level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected, between primary sensory hindlimb cortices for both NEC (  r  \u2009=\u20090.389\u2009\u00b1\u20090.138) and GAERS (  r  \u2009=\u20090.463\u2009\u00b1\u20090.173). In contrast, there was low intrahemispheric connectivity strength between hindlimb cortex and cingulate cortex (NEC 0.291\u2009\u00b1\u20090.111, GAERS 0.332\u2009\u00b1\u20090.124). These findings confirm specificity of our data to known functional connectivities ( ). \n\n\n#### Global network parameters \n  \nThe global network parameters clustering coefficient, shortest path length, and small world index ( ,  ) were calculated using MagnAn for a range of network densities (  k  \u2009=\u20092\u201320). Metrics were normalized by comparison to 1,000 random networks with equivalent nodes and edges count. Network parameters are dependent on the network density   k  , which is the ratio of the actual number of edges to the total number of potential edges between all nodes in the network. The clustering coefficient measures the fraction of neighbors of a node that are neighbors of each other. The global clustering coefficient   \u03b3   is the average of all local clustering coefficients. The global shortest path length   \u03bb   indicates the efficiency of the overall information flux within the network and is defined by the average number of edges needed to travel from one node to another. The small world index   \u03c3   is the ratio of the latter two metrics,   \u03b3  \/  \u03bb  . Small worldness is greater than 1 for networks with tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, as seen in regular networks, but also for short path lengths between elements, as in random networks ( ). As the network density increases, global network parameters become more similar. Global parameters were compared on group level with unpaired (GAERS vs. NEC) or paired (juvenile vs. adult) Student\u2019s   t  -test. The network density of   k  \u2009=\u20096, representing the strongest 240 connections between brain regions (i.e. approximately 8% of all connections), was selected as the threshold for all further analyses, as it approximately corresponds to the inflection point in global parameter plots. \n\n\n#### Local network parameters \n  \nLocal network parameters were calculated using MagnAn. Degree, strength, clustering coefficient, shortest path length, betweenness and hub score were determined for each node and data set. The degree represents the number of connections associated with a single node. The strength is calculated as the sum of link weights of a node. A high hub score indicates importance of brain regions with above-average high number of connections (degree), a high level of betweenness centrality and short average path length ( ). Local node parameter data did not pass Shapiro Wilk-test (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05) for normal distribution. Group comparisons were performed with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis-test (IBM SPSS statistics 25,  ). Obvious group differences in local node parameters were then tested for statistical significance by applying posthoc Mann Whitney U-test with correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \nGroup comparisons. \n  \nSummary of non-parametric testing (Kruskal\u2013Wallis-test) of local node parameters at   k  \u2009=\u20096.   (A)   First 38 bilateral brain regions were tested for interhemispheric differences. Then variance analysis of effects of strain (GAERS and NEC), age (juvenile and adult) and group (juvenile GAERS and NEC and adult GAERS and NEC, respectively) was applied to 42 brain regions.   (B)   Interaction between strain and age was significant for the local node parameters strength and path length in the juvenile groups. CC, correlation coefficient; PL, shortest path length; BW, betweenness; HS, hub score. \n  \n\n#### Network topology \n  \nCommunity structure was evaluated using Gephi, version 0.9.7, an open-source software for graph theoretical analysis ( ). The algorithm ( ) partitioned the rs-fMRI network into sub-communities of densely connected nodes, with nodes from distinct communities exhibiting sparse connections. To display the network ( ), we used the force-based algorithm implemented in Gephi ( ). Node labels identify anatomical brain regions. Color of nodes indicates affiliation with functional group. Magnitudes of degree were utilized to code node and label size in network depictions. Edge thickness was calibrated to reflect strength of correlation coefficients. Group differences in network connectivity between strains and age groups were assessed using network-based statistics (NBS), implemented in MagnAn. A homoscedastic Student\u2019s   t  -test between FDR-corrected correlation matrices at   k  \u2009=\u20096 was performed and corrected for multiple testing by 1,000 times permutation ( ). The identified significant component of functional connections that differed between GAERS and NEC, as well as between juvenile and adult NEC, is displayed as overlay on a set of representative midline axial and lateral sagittal T1w images ( ). \n  \nNetwork topology. Group-averaged force-based network plots of juvenile and adult GAERS   (A,B)   and NEC   (C,D)  , respectively, at a network density of   k  \u2009=\u20096. Nodes represent brain regions and edges connections between them. Arrangement and closeness of nodes takes correlation strength between brain regions into account. Brain networks subdivided into three major communities, indicated by light grey ellipses, irrespective of strain and age: one cortical community, comprising association cortex (orange) and sensorimotor cortex (red) mingling with basal ganglia (grey) and some limbic regions (blue); one sensory input community (green) colocalized with limbic region periaqueductal grey (blue) and one subcortical community comprising thalamic (pink), sensory input (green) and limbic regions (blue). Node and label size scale with degree and edge thickness represents the correlation strength between connected brain regions. Nodes are color-coded according to affiliation with functional group. Abbreviations of brain regions can be found in  . \n    \nNetwork based statistics. NBS at   k  \u2009=\u20096 revealed significant differences between brain networks of GAERS and NEC in both, the juvenile   (A,D)   and the adult   (B,E)   groups, and between juvenile and adult NEC   (C,F)  . Graphical layouts   (A\u2013C)   are overlaid, in approximate anatomical position, on one representative left and right sagittal and one axial MR image (scale bar in grey). Only nodes with significantly altered connections are shown. Colors encode affiliation with the functional group. The colors of the edges are a combination of the colors of the connected nodes. Statistically stronger connections in GAERS compared to NEC   (A,B)   and in adult compared to juvenile NEC   (C)   are represented by thick lines, thin lines represent statistically weaker connections for the respective comparison. Matrices   (D\u2013F)   summarize the numbers of significantly different connections between brain regions per functional group (please note, sensory cortex and motor cortex as well as limbic system and limbic output were combined) when comparing GAERS with NEC   (D,E)   and adult with juvenile NEC   (F)  . If two numbers are shown in one cell, the first represents the number of stronger, the second the number of weaker connections for the respective comparison. Group permutations: 1,000, alpha:   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n  \n\n\n### Manganese-enhanced MRI \n  \n#### Preparation \n  \nWithin a week after the last rs-fMRI examination, mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet, Model 2001) were subcutaneously implanted in the shoulder region. The pumps had been prefilled with 200\u2009\u03bcL MnCl \u2009\u00d7\u20094H O (Sigma) in 0.4\u2009M bicine buffer (Sigma), pH 7.4, to continuously deliver a cumulative dose of 150\u2009mg\/kg MnCl \u2009\u00d7\u20094H O within 7\u2009days at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL\/h. For surgery, animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane (initiation 5%\/continuous dose 2.5% in 100% oxygen) and received buprenorphine (bolus s.c. 0.05\u2009mg\/kg, Temgesic, Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare UK Ltd., Hull, United Kingdom) 30\u2009min before surgery. Rats tolerated subcutaneous pump implantations and 7d continuous manganese applications well. \n\n\n#### Acquisition \n  \nWe acquired T1w 3D FLASH scans prior to and at day 8 after pump implantation. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR\/TE: 21\/7.6\u2009ms, FA: 10\u00b0, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm  FOV, 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320\u2009\u00d7\u200980 matrix, 94\u2009\u00d7\u200994\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm . We applied fat suppression and respiration trigger. Signal enhancement in the pituary gland and dentate gyrus confirmed manganese delivery via osmotic pumps in all animals. \n\n\n#### Analysis \n  \nBrains were manually segmented from 3D T1w FLASH scans and registered on the template of the RatSigma atlas with 114 brain regions via ANTS (Advanced Normalization Tools [47], two stage build-template approach). Next, median smoothing with a 7\u2009\u00d7\u20097\u2009\u00d7\u20097 kernel was performed and a homoscedastic Student\u2019s   t  -test was calculated between registered images of GAERS vs. NEC animals (  n  \u2009=\u200912, each) to compare signal intensities. On the resulting   t  -values a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was applied and finally a multiple comparison correction (100 repetitions with random group assignment) was performed. Voxels were thresholded at 99.9th percentile   t  -value (  t  \u2009=\u20094.02420, corresponding to   p  \u2009=\u20090.00057). The resulting color map shows areas with more than 500 voxels exhibiting significant signal enhancement in GAERS compared to NEC, overlaid on the mean difference image. \n\nRegistration of high-resolution 3D T1w datasets additionally provided morphometric data. For analysis, the RatSigma atlas was transformed into each individual subjects\u2019 space using the inverse of the deformation field per subject obtained in the above registration step. The average volumes of each brain structure in all GAERS and NEC were analyzed using a Student\u2019s   t  -test to identify brain structures significantly differing in volume. The lack of difference in whole brain volumes pre and post manganese application (for NEC 1759\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009mm  (pre), 1767\u2009\u00b1\u200937\u2009mm  (post), Student\u2019s paired   t  -test 0.088; and for GAERS 1821\u2009\u00b1\u200940\u2009mm  (pre), 1828\u2009\u00b1\u200936\u2009mm  (post), Student\u2019s paired   t  -test   p  \u2009=\u20090.403) suggests that signal enhancement due to manganese accumulation did not significantly impact brain volume determination in T1w 3D data sets. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe present longitudinal rs-fMRI study started with 3\u2009months old rats, an age at which GAERS have a seizure prevalence of 100% ( ). We found general differences between epileptic and non-epileptic brain networks. Other than expected, no brain network alterations\/adaptations were detected in GAERS over the ensuing 5 months of life. \n\nThe initial analysis of   z  -transformed correlation coefficients averaged by strain and examination time point ( ) showed generally higher FC for GAERS than for NEC (repeated measure (rm) ANOVA,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01;  ). However, no substantial differences were observed with increasing age of animals. It was assumed that animals had fully matured at 6\u2009months of age, and therefore, correlation matrices were averaged across 3, 4, and 5\u2009months data and classified as juvenile NEC\/GAERS, and averaged across 6, 7, and 8\u2009months data and classified as adult NEC\/GAERS. This grouping of data was based on the body weight time profile, which demonstrated an increase from 3 to 5\u2009months of age, followed by a plateau from 6\u2009months and onwards ( ; rm ANOVA  ). Brain volumes (determined through data registration), also only increased significantly between 3 to 5\u2009months of age ( ; rm ANOVA  ). A similar age categorization had been applied in a recent longitudinal study in Long Evans rats (which also exhibit absence seizures) by Kozac et al. ( ). The subsequent analyses were performed on these grouped data. \n\n### Global network topology \n  \nThe global network parameters clustering coefficient, shortest pathlength, and small world index became similar with increasing network density between all groups ( \u2013 ). The similarity in global parameters suggested that both GAERS and NEC have similarly efficient brain networks. To identify potential differences, we chose a   k  \u2009=\u20096 (inflection point in  \u2013 ), considering the 240 (that is the 8%) strongest connections as threshold for the construction of networks, the NBS, and the calculation of local node parameters. \n\n\n### Community structure \n  \nForce-based network plots ( ) at   k  \u2009=\u20096 were used to display network topologies of juvenile and adult GAERS and NEC. This graphic illustrates the 80 brain regions as nodes with the 240 strongest connections represented as edges. Arrangement and proximity of nodes takes correlation strength between brain regions into account. Node and label sizes scale with degree, which is defined as the number of connections per brain region, while edge thickness indicates the correlation strength between connected brain regions. Overall community structure was comparable in both age groups in GAERS ( , ) and NEC ( , ). Across all groups, most connections were formed between cortical regions. Brain networks subdivided into three major communities, indicated by light grey ellipses: One community was primarily cortical, with regions of sensorimotor cortex (red) and association cortex (orange) associated with basal ganglia (grey) and some limbic regions (blue). The second community was composed of regions from sensory input (green) and the limbic region periaqueductal gray (PAG, blue) and some basal ganglia regions in juvenile NEC. The third community included thalamic (pink), limbic (blue), and sensory input regions (green). In juvenile GAERS ( ), the cortical community was entirely separate from the exclusively subcortical communities. Even the limbic and basal ganglia regions, associated closely with the cortical community in all other groups, tended to form a small subcommunity in juvenile GAERS (to a lesser extent also observed in adult GAERS). The consistent gathering of respective left and right bilateral brain regions within the same community confirmed strong, preserved functional connectivity between the hemispheres. \n\n\n### NBS \n  \nNBS at   k  \u2009=\u20096 identified notable differences of brain networks between strains in both age groups ( , , , ), but only NEC showed significant differences with maturation ( , ). Brain networks of GAERS formed stronger connections (thick lines) than age-matched NEC, while only few connections were significantly weaker (thin lines) ( , ). When comparing juvenile groups ( , ), NBS revealed 42 nodes involved in network changes in the epileptic brain, with 111 stronger and 1 weaker connections (component probability   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). When comparing adult groups ( , ), 39 nodes were involved in 99 stronger and 3 weaker connections (component probability:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002). Overlaying nodes with statistically different connection strength on anatomical sagittal and coronal MR images ( \u2013 ), highlights the enhanced FC of brain regions within and between hemispheres in epileptic animals. Irrespective of age, GAERS exhibited stronger connections, particularly among brain regions of association cortex (orange), sensory cortex (red) and motor cortex (rose) and with basal ganglia (grey) and limbic regions (blue). Similarly, thalamic regions (pink) were more strongly interconnected in GAERS when compared to NEC. Far less statistically significant differences were identified between juvenile and adult brain networks of rats of the same strain. For NEC ( , ), there were 21 nodes identified, with 29 stronger and 1 weaker connection (component probability:   p  \u2009=\u20090.028). Adult NEC formed stronger connections within and between limbic (blue) and sensory input regions (green), and between cortical (red and orange) and basal ganglia (grey) regions. However, in GAERS, NBS did not indicate significant age-related differences (component size: 14 nodes, 14 connections; component probability:   p  \u2009=\u20090.182). \n\n\n### Local node parameters \n  \nLocal node parameters were calculated in addition to the NBS to further pinpoint which brain regions were specifically engaged in the epileptic network. Across all groups, the top 20 regions in terms of degree rank were observed in both hemispheres in association cortex, sensorimotor cortex and limbic system (highlighted by bold colors in  ). In all groups except juvenile GAERS, sensory input regions were also present in the top 20 regions of degree. Almost exclusively in GAERS, basal ganglia regions were among the top 20 in degree. The laterality index of brain region-wise degrees did not indicate hemispheric dominance ( ). Additionally, group comparisons did not reveal significant interhemispheric differences for any of the local node parameters between 38 bilateral brain regions ( ). Kruskal\u2013Wallis-Test revealed significant effects of strain (for strength and path length), but not of age. Significant interactions were found between groups for strength and path length, with a significant effect in juvenile groups ( ). Radar plots illustrate the local node parameters strength ( ) and path length ( ) in juvenile rats, averaged by hemispheres. The posthoc analysis (Mann Whitney U-Test) of juvenile groups revealed significantly higher strengths of the basal ganglia regions nucleus accumbens (Acb) and claustrum (Cl), and the limbic region habenulum (Hb) in GAERS. Path length was significantly lower in the insular cortex (Ins) and in the basal ganglia regions Acb and Cl in juvenile GAERS. By closer examination of local parameters that were averaged over hemisphere and age ( ), posthoc testing revealed significantly higher strength ( ) and degree ( ) in GAERS in regions of the association and the sensorimotor cortex, cingulate cortex (Cg), parietal association cortex (PtA), Ins, and primary motor cortex (M1), as well as in the limbic region septum (Sep). In NEC, degree was higher in periaqueductal gray (PAG) and in the sensory input regions superior colliculus (SC) and tegmentum (Teg). In NEC, significantly higher clustering coefficients were observed ( ) in the sensory input regions pretectal area (PTA) and pontine nucleus (Pn), and in paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV). The association cortex regions PtA and Ins, sensory cortex of the hindlimb (S1HL) and the basal ganglia region Cl exhibited significantly lower path length ( ) in GAERS when compared to NEC. A statistically significant higher betweenness ( ) was observed in Acb and caudate putamen (Cpu). Secondary sensory cortex (S2) betweenness was higher in NEC. PtA, Acb, and Cpu showed a significantly higher hub score ( ) in GAERS. In NEC, the sensory input regions Teg, SC, Pn and raphe nucleus (R) were identified as network hubs. \n  \nLocal parameters.   (A)   Laterality indices of the local parameter degree for both juvenile and adult GAERS and NEC do not indicate hemispheric dominance. Dots represent brain regions, light grey areas indicate the laterality index (LI) threshold set at 0.3. Radar plots display strength   (B)   and path length   (C)   of juvenile GAERS (light blue) and NEC (light orange) averaged across hemispheres. Asterisks indicate significant differences between strains (Posthoc Mann Whitney U *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01). List of abbreviations of brain regions can be found in  . Summary of results of non-parametric variance analysis are reported in  . \n  \nDifferences in local network parameters supported the picture revealed by NBS, highlighting the segregation of cortical regions, and the prominent role of basal ganglia and limbic nodes in the epileptic network. \n\n#### MEMRI \n  \nNext, we investigated whether an alternative functional readout based on long-term accumulation of manganese over time in adult behaving animals after the rs-fMRI study\u2019s last time point would yield results consistent with our rs-fMRI findings. In general, continuous manganese application over 7\u2009days to 8\u2009months-old rats of both strains resulted in non-uniform SI enhancement, particularly strong in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex ( ). Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was applied to compare manganese accumulation pattern between strains. TFCE maps ( ) show significantly higher signal intensity in GAERS in sensory cortex regions like barrel field and jaw. Additionally, significantly higher signal was evident in GAERS in the association cortex (retrosplenial, insular and cingulate cortex). Striatum and limbic regions, specifically the septum and hypothalamus also showed statistically significant signal increase. \n  \nMEMRI post-contrast signal difference maps. Pixels with significantly higher post contrast signal intensity in GAERS than NEC are shown and overlaid onto the mean difference image. Ellipses highlight selected areas with significant vs. NEC\u2019s signal enhancement. Color scale uses arbitrary units for signal intensity difference. Color of labels and ellipses indicate functional group affiliation. \n  \nTo facilitate individual comparison of MEMRI with rs-fMRI data, the 8\u2009m rs-fMRI data underwent a secondary graph analysis. A multiparametric analysis was conducted using the RatSigmaAtlas brain template, which consisted of 114 grey matter brain regions with fine-grained resolution of cortical and limbic regions and much coarser labelling of subcortical regions, in order to fully leverage the high resolution of MEMRI data. The resulting rs-network topology of GAERS at   k  \u2009=\u20096 (342 strongest connections) is displayed in  . The network segregated again into 3 communities (indicated by dashed grey lines). One community was composed of sensorimotor (red) and association (orange) cortex regions, the second community united limbic regions (blue), sensory input regions (green) and thalamus (pink), and the third community included sensory input, limbic, basal ganglia (grey) regions and brain stem (white). Node size in   scales with degree, highlighting the particularly strong FC within cortical brain regions. \n  \nSynopsis.   (A)   Force-based network plot of community structure for GAERS based on analysis of 8\u2009m rs-fMRI data with the RatSigma template at   k  \u2009=\u20096.   (B)   Same network plot as in   (A)  , but only highlighting regions with significant MEMRI hyperintensity.   (C)   Same network plot as in   (A)  , but only highlighting regions with significant volume increase. Node sizes scale with degree   (A)  , % signal enhancement   (B)   or % volume increase   (C)  , respectively. Colors indicate functional group affiliation (orange\u2009=\u2009association cortex, red\u2009=\u2009sensorimotor cortex, grey\u2009=\u2009basal ganglia, blue\u2009=\u2009limbic system, green\u2009=\u2009sensory input, pink\u2009=\u2009thalamus). Brain region abbreviations are listed in  . \n  \nApplying the RatSigmaAtlas brain template to MEMRI data revealed significantly higher manganese accumulation in approximately half of the analyzed brain regions in GAERS compared to NEC in line with TFCE maps ( ) (i.e., 56 of 114 brain regions using the unpaired Student\u2019s   t  -test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected). In particular, a significantly higher level of signal enhancement (highlighted in color in  ) was observed in the retrosplenial cortex (retrosplenial granular cortex part A, RSGA and retrosplenial dysgranular cortex, RSD), as well as in the insular (dysgranular insular cortex, InsD and cingulate cortex (primary, CG1, and secondary, CG2 cingulate cortex). Also the basal ganglia (striatum, STR, and basal forebrain, Bfb), the interpeduncular nucleus of sensory input region (IP), limbic regions such as the septum (Sep), hypothalamus (Hyp), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and subregions of the hippocampus (cornu ammonis, CA1 and CA3), and brain stem (BS) showed significantly higher manganese accumulation. The size of the nodes in   is proportional to the percent difference in MEMRI signal between post-contrast GAERS and NEC. \n\n\n#### Deformation-based volumetry \n  \nTotal brain volumes were slightly greater in GAERS (WM 213\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009mm ; GM 1586\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u2009mm ; ventricle 32\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009mm ) compared to NEC (WM 201\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mm ; GM 1537\u2009\u00b1\u200938\u2009mm ; ventricle 32\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009mm ) at 8\u2009months of age (Student\u2019s   t  -test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). Deformation-based analysis revealed significantly higher volumes (highlighted in color in  ) for secondary cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex (dysgranular cortex and granular cortex part B) in GAERS. Also, several regions of the sensory cortex (barrel field, dysgranular zone 0, trunk upper lip and primary and secondary visual cortex), as well as the limbic region dentate gyrus and the thalamus had higher volumes in GAERS. \n\n\n#### Synopsis of 8\u2009months data \n  \nFunctional readouts and morphometry yielded consistent but partly complementary results. rs-fMRI identified more and stronger connections within the cortical community in GAERS, suggesting an important role of association and sensorimotor regions in the epileptic network. Notably, approximately half of the regions of the cortical community exhibited significant manganese accumulation. Specifically, secondary cingulate cortex and retrosplenial granular cortex part B also showed volume increase. Limbic regions exhibited strong rs-FC within the functional group and with association cortex and sensory input regions in GAERS. However, this high temporal synchronicity was associated with MEMRI hyperintensities only in PAG, Sep, hypothalamus (Hyp) and some hippocampal subregions (CA1 and CA3). The thalamus (right hemisphere) and the sensory input region interpeduncular nucleus (IP) and basal ganglia also exhibited significant MEMRI hyperintensity, but only the thalamus increased in volume. The basal ganglia, thalamus and IP showed relatively lower degree compared to cortical nodes. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Major findings \n  \nOur longitudinal rs-fMRI data suggested that GAERS have a characteristic, disease-specific resting state-brain network, which appears to be fully developed in juvenile rats and differs from the network found in age-matched non-epileptic controls. MEMRI and volumetry data obtained from 8\u2009months-old animals added further evidence for functional and morphological differences between GAERS and NEC. \n\n\n### rs-fMRI \n  \nGraph theory analysis revealed that global network parameters were within the expected range and similar in GAERS and NEC, implying efficiently working brain networks in both strains. Across all timepoints, resting state-FC was consistently higher in GAERS. In line with our previous study ( ), we found strong FC intra-cortically and between cortical, basal ganglia, and limbic regions in GAERS. \n\nIn contrast to the previous study, we now applied a different anesthesia protocol, using low-dose Isoflurane instead of Neurolept. By applying Isoflurane, GAERS were in a SWD-free state, under the same controlled anesthetic condition as NEC. We compared brain networks between GAERS and NEC, and expected the impact of low-dose Isoflurane to be similar and constant in both strains. Isoflurane-dose-dependent cortical segregation, and disruption of thalamo-cortical and subcortical FC have been reported ( ,  ), and have been associated with loss of consciousness under anesthesia. We applied 1.1\u20131.2% Isoflurane and kept examination times short in order to preserve major brain networks ( ,  ). The general network topology of GAERS and NEC in the present study was in agreement with rs-fMRI studies in na\u00efve rodents, under Medetomidine ( ,  ) and in the awake condition ( ). In both strains, key nodes of the sensorimotor network, default mode network (DMN, Rs, and cg) and salience network (Ins and cg) formed a shared cortical community associated to varying extent with basal ganglia regions. Furthermore, a subcortical community consisting of limbic, sensory input, and thalamic regions was observed. In agreement with D\u2019Souza ( ), a small additional community with the sensory input region SC and with PAG was found. \n\nWe recognize that FC within the cortical community and with basal ganglia was rather high, whereas FC of thalamic nuclei within the brain network was less strongly represented. Despite the fact that these findings may indicate potential anesthesia effects, we detected significantly enhanced FC in GAERS compared to NEC in both age groups which seemed to be characteristic for the epileptic brain. We retrieved network components previously identified during absences in both animal models and human patients. The peri-oral region has long been shown to be the region of onset of absence seizures in WAG\/Rij rats ( ) and in GAERS ( ). During ongoing seizures, SWD then occur generalized over the entire cortex. A high degree of cortico-cortical correlation has been reported in WAG\/Rij rats under Neurolept sedation during epochs with and without SWDs, but not in non-epileptic control Wistar rats ( ). Clemens et al. ( ) interpreted the increased FC of the seizure onset area with the remaining cortical areas in humans as a state facilitating seizure propagation among the cortical network. The findings of Studer et al. indicate that in GAERS increased synaptic connectivity, especially through horizontal links from deep cortical neurons are critical in the neuronal synchronization in absence seizures ( ). In absence epilepsy patients, involvement of the DMN and salience network (bilateral insular, anterior cingulate, and temporal\u2013parietal cortices) has been recognized and has been associated primarily with cognitive dysfunction and disruption of attention and awareness during seizures ( ). Other studies, using fMRI ( ) or MEG ( ,  ), additionally reported increased FC between sensorimotor and limbic regions and increased cortical FC between hemispheres ( ). However, there are also some conflicting findings, such as reports of reduced interictal DMN ( ) and attention network FC ( ) in human patients compared to controls. Involvement of the basal ganglia in the remote control of absence seizures ( ) has previously been suggested by pharmacological and electrophysiological studies in animal models of absence epilepsy ( ). Consistently, a recent rs-fMRI study in CAE ( ) found strong FC within the basal ganglia network and between basal ganglia nuclei and other brain regions. \n\nDespite the occurrence of hundreds of absence seizures per day between 3\u2009months and 8\u2009months of age, we did not detect progressive FC changes in epileptic animals. Only in NEC we found age-related differences in FC. In adult NEC, NBS identified a component with statistically stronger intracortical connections, stronger FC between cortical regions and basal ganglia, and stronger FC between limbic and sensory input regions than in juvenile NEC. This aligns with findings in human studies ( ,  ), which suggest an increase in the segregation of functional brain circuits with age. The shift is from stronger short-range connections in children, limited to primary sensory and motor brain regions, to stronger and more distinct patterns of long-range connections in adults, involving retrosplenial and insular cortex and subcortical regions. This shift has been linked to brain growth and expanding myelination, which enables faster information transmission ( ). No such network differences were found between juvenile and adult GAERS. We speculate that the pathology in juvenile GAERS may have interfered with the normal shaping of circuitry during maturation. Aberrant functional connectivity has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ). \n\nWhen comparing between strains, NBS revealed a component with a higher number of significantly stronger connections in GAERS compared to NEC in both age groups, predominantly involving brain regions from association and sensorimotor cortex, from basal ganglia, and from limbic regions. Our NBS results support the notion that strong cortico-cortical FC reflect the strong synchronicity found during SWD activity. Basal ganglia regions, in particular the nucleus accumbens which showed high FC in our study are believed to play a central role in seizure control through their interplay with the striato-nigral pathway and the dopaminergic system ( ). Enhanced expression of D3 dopamine receptor mRNA in the nucleus accumbens of adult GAERS in comparison to NEC has been observed ( ). High FC within limbic regions and with cingulate cortex and insular cortex, also referred to as limbic cortex, on the other hand, may be related to social behavior deficits observed in GAERS ( ). Sociability in rodents is thought to be mediated by neural circuits densely populated with T-type calcium channels and GAERS contain a missense mutation in the Cav3.2\u2009T-type calcium channel gene. Henbid et al. observed reduced sociability in female GAERS ( ). \n\nLongitudinal neuroimaging data is more accessible from rat models of TLE. TLE models induce status epilepticus (SE) by focally lesioning the brain (e.g. with kainate injections). After an initial latency period, spontaneous recurrent convulsive seizures occur in the long-term (chronic phase). Histopathological examinations revealed massive local neuronal degradation and gliosis in this model. The severe pathology of TLE models compared to absence epilepsy models is associated with progressive brain network alterations. In a longitudinal rs-fMRI studies, analyzed through graph theory, Christiaen et al. ( ) observed a decrease in global FC that was most significant during epileptogenesis, specifically occurring between 1 and 3\u2009weeks post-SE. Afterwards, network connectivity remained unchanged. In addition to the finding that the maximum loss of hippocampal volume occurred 1\u2009week post-SE, the authors concluded that alterations in network topology resulted from neuronal tissue loss. One intriguing finding from that study was a negative correlation between early shifts in network topology and later seizure frequency, suggesting that a minimal level of organization is necessary for seizures emergence. In agreement, Bertoglio et al. ( ) reported widespread hyposynchrony at 2\u2009weeks post-SE in the same model. However, a significant increase in network synchronicity occurred between 2 to 4\u2009weeks post-SE, suggesting potential network reinforcement during seizure recurrence. Gill et al. ( ) also observed elevated intra- and interhemispheric connectivity, particularly within the DMN and between limbic and DMN structures, 5\u2009weeks after SE in animals, with postmortem histologically confirmed neuronal damage. Li et al. ( ) detected increased FC in the sensorimotor cortex and limbic regions at 10\u2009days post-SE, which was found to be a predictive marker for epileptogenesis. This was confirmed through longitudinal EEG recordings between the ages of 2 and 4\u2009months. In these rodent models, progressive brain network alterations towards lower FC appeared to occur in temporal sequence with TLE-related macroscopic brain alterations. Once the epilepsy phenotype is established, network connectivity that is either stable or increased is observed. The brain regions involved in this network include cortical, basal ganglia, and limbic regions, which are of importance also in our current study of absence epilepsy. \n\n\n### MEMRI \n  \nWe utilized MEMRI as an independent readout of FC for 8\u2009months-old GAERS and NEC. Our findings demonstrated that GAERS exhibited higher overall brain signal enhancement, which indicated higher integrated manganese accumulation in epileptic brains and is consistent with enhanced overall rs-FC. TFCE-maps revealed the highest significant bilateral differences in the retrosplenial cortex, medial entorhinal cortex, brain stem and interpeduncular nucleus, as well as in the right primary visual cortex and somatosensory cortex. Region-based analysis revealed significantly higher signal intensities in approximately half of the analyzed brain regions in GAERS compared to NEC. Both MEMRI and rs-fMRI consistently showed higher brain activity in GAERS compared to NEC in cortical key components of sensorimotor network, DMN (retrosplenial and cingulate cortex) and salience network (insular cortex). In subcortical regions, functional readouts showed less distinct resemblance. MEMRI hyperintensities were prominent in interpeduncular nucleus, limbic regions septum, hypothalamus and PAG, while rs-fMRI displayed relatively higher connectedness in sensory input regions and various hippocampal subregions (dentate gyrus and fasciola cinereum). Both rs-fMRI and MEMRI provided consistent but partly complementary information. rs-fMRI took a \u201csnapshot\u201d of synchronous, spontaneous, neuronal activity in the anesthetized animal. However, fMRI only provides an indirect readout of neuronal activity. The temporal representation of brain activity by fMRI is inherently blurry, because the hemodynamic response is slow (range of seconds) compared to neuronal activity (tens of millisecond range) and the time resolution of the rs-fMRI sequences is in the range of seconds. MEMRI hyperintensity reflected the integrated neuronal activity (with and without seizures) over a week in behaving 8\u2009months-old animals. Recently, the role of astrocytes as a sink for manganese has been discussed ( ), but it should be noted that MRI is unable to distinguish astrocytes from other cells. Enhanced manganese accumulation was observed during post-stroke inflammatory processes and was associated with activated microglia and reactive astrocytes ( ). Neuronal loss as a prerequisite of local brain inflammation was not found in GAERS ( ), but reactive astrogliosis coupled with altered cytokine expression has been observed in GAERS and was linked to epileptogenesis ( ). \n\nSeveral previous publications have demonstrated the high sensitivity of MEMRI to map neuronal activity. In na\u00efve animals, both natural ( ) and artificial stimuli ( ) elicited local hyperintensities following the systemic administration of MnCl . Eschenko et al. ( ) reported patterns of running-induced T1-weighted MRI signal enhancement resulting from increased Mn  accumulation in activated brain regions in voluntarily running rats, compared to the sedentary controls. Another study found that MEMRI can identify brain regions linked to food intake, reward\/addiction and locomotor activity in a rat model of hyperphagia ( ). However, in other studies examining TLE, MEMRI contrast was not sensitive to prolonged seizure activity during the chronic phase ( ,  ). Dedeurwaerdere et al. ( ) even reported an inverse correlation between seizures and MEMRI signal after intraventricular MnCl  injection in the chronic epileptic phase. Only Alvestad et al. ( ) identified MEMRI hyperintensities in the entorhinal cortex and amygdala after subcutaneous injection of manganese in a TLE study during the chronic phase. In our study, we observed overall MEMRI hyperintensities at maximum moderate levels. Absence seizures are characterized by highly synchronized neuronal activity generalized across the cortex, but the degree of activity may be lower than anticipated, especially when considering the ratio of total seizure time (ictal) to interictal time. Furthermore, a recent EEG-fMRI study in GAERS ( ) revealed long-lasting decreased seizure-associated activity in most cortical and thalamic neurons. The authors linked their findings to the loss of consciousness during seizures. \n\n\n### Volumetry \n  \nAt 8\u2009months of age, we observed higher brain volumes in GAERS as compared to age-matched NEC. Boullieret et al. ( ) also found increased volumes in GAERS compared to NEC in amygdala and cortex already at 3\u2009months of age. But, Kirazli et al. ( ) reported reduced thickness in auditory and visual cortices, and striatum, and overall brain size in GAERS at 1 and 2\u2009months of age based on a histological study. Notably, in that study, normal Wistar and GAERS did not show significant volumetric differences at P10, and the authors speculated that GAERS are ordinary at that early age. The clinical findings remain conflicting and differ by region. In agreement with the current study, a voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis ( ) confirmed augmented gray matter volumes in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate. Additionally, an increased thickness of the posterior medial cortex, a region linked to the DMN, was reported in patients with newly onset CAE ( ). Some researchers have observed widespread cortical thinning in patients with absence seizures ( ), while others have found no cortical thinning with age ( ). Thalamic volumes have been found to be increased ( ), but several CAE studies have reported thalamic and caudate atrophy ( ). \n\n\n### General conclusion \n  \nrs-fMRI, MEMRI and volumetric data collectively suggest the importance of cortical networks in GAERS, which correlates with an increased fronto-central connectivity in human absence epilepsy patients. Our findings also verify involvement of basal ganglia and limbic regions. The network differences between GAERS and NEC are observed already in juvenile animals. The findings by Jarre et al. ( ) who identified initial oscillatory discharges in the primary somatosensory cortex as early as in the third week of life in GAERS by cortical LFP measurements indicate that the formation of the epileptic network occurs before 3\u2009months of age. In clinical studies, Davis et al. ( ) found increased cortical EEG-connectivity during sleep already in infants with disrupted early brain development at the cellular level in tuberous sclerosis complex who later developed epilepsy. These authors speculated that neurological diseases occurring during critical stages of brain maturation may affect normal neurodevelopment. Our preclinical study indicates that an epilepsy-related network is already present very early in neurodevelopment and that this early condition shapes dynamic brain function more than chronic absence seizures. Clinical studies to further test this hypothesis are recommended. \n\n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe animal study was approved by Landesamt f\u00fcr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany.

Difficulties performing intraoperative mapping have limited its adoption for lesions in\/near eloquent regions. In this institutional case series, we demonstrate the utility of fMRI-adjunct planning for LITT near language or motor areas. Six out of 7 patients proceeded with LITT after fMRI-based tractography determined adequate safety margins for ablation. All underwent successful ablation without new or worsening postoperative symptoms requiring adjuvant corticosteroids, including those with preexisting deficits. fMRI is an easily accessible adjunct which may potentially reduce chances of complications in LITT near eloquent structures. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLaser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical ablation technique with shown efficacy in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors, radiation necrosis (RN), and epileptogenic foci [ ]. The advent of MR guidance [ ] and real-time thermography [ ] have made LITT an increasingly utilized tool among neurosurgeons. Initially used primarily for deep-seated lesions, LITT\u2019s increasing indications include patient frailty, patient preference, and decreased morbidity in some cases relative to open surgery [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Despite these advantages, LITT can still pose a risk of unintended thermal damage to adjacent normal brain tissue [ ]. Near eloquent structures, LITT may cause postoperative deficits in motor or language function, even with the aid of MR guidance [ ]. This is further exacerbated by the inability to perform cortical or subcortical mapping during ablation secondary to targeting\/trajectory disturbances from physiologic movement. Therefore, many are investigating utilization of awake neurologic assessment [ ] or non-invasive patient immobilization [ ]. However, these additions are not without extra cost to the patient and increased discomfort during the prolonged procedure. \n\nGiven these limitations, our institution has adopted fMRI for preoperative language and motor mapping to better guide treatment choice and intra-procedural thermal safety. In this institutional case series, we present 7 patients with intracranial lesions in or near eloquent structures who underwent preoperative fMRI for consideration of LITT. By reporting clinical outcomes in this cohort, we aim to demonstrate an easily accessible adjunct measure for improving LITT outcomes in patients with high-risk lesions. \n\n\n## Case series \n  \nPatients who underwent LITT at our institution for any indication and fMRI prior to treatment (Neuroblate, Monteris Medical) were identified retrospectively with institutional IRB approval (Table\u00a0 ). fMRI was performed to lateralize language, localize functional areas with respect to lesions, indicate risk of functional deficits, and determine feasibility and safety margins for LITT (Figs.  ,  , and  ). Only one patient [Patient 7] did not undergo LITT due to significant eloquent involvement on fMRI analysis and ultimately succumbed to widespread disease progression (Fig.\u00a0 ). Surgical outcomes and postoperative deficits were subsequently reported (Table\u00a0 ).\n   \nSummary of 7 fMRI-adjuvant LITT candidates including primary disease, lesion location, fMRI indication, and surgical decision making \n  \n GBM   glioblastoma multiforme,   SCLC   small cell lung cancer,   NSCLC   non-small cell lung cancer,   IOM   intraoperative monitoring \n    \n[Patient 4] fMRI demonstrating left temporal lesion (purple) without invasion of Wernicke\u2019s area (pink) or the communicating superior portion of the temporal stem and orbital frontal lobe (orange); green dotted line\u2009=\u2009trajectory planning for laser ablation probe \n    \n a   [Patient 5] fMRI demonstrating left supramarginal gyrus lesion (orange) posterior to the postcentral gyrus without invasion of functional language areas (pink); orange dotted line\u2009=\u2009trajectory planning for laser ablation probe.   b   [Patient 5] Intraoperative temperature safety points (white crosshairs) and ablation safety margin (blue outline) using Monteris Neuroblate system \n    \n a   [Patient 6] fMRI used to determine safety margin for a left parietal lesion near angular gyrus (purple) posterior to Wernicke\u2019s area; orange dotted line\u2009=\u2009trajectory planning for laser ablation probe.   b   [Patient 6] Intraoperative temperature safety points (white crosshairs) and ablation safety margin (blue outline) using Monteris Neuroblate system \n    \n[Patient 7] fMRI demonstrating paracentral lesion too close to activation of leg motor (green) and hand motor (yellow) shown with respective subcortical tracts; patient underwent open resection with mapping instead of LITT \n    \nPostoperative surgical and long-term clinical outcomes of fMRI-adjuvant LITT \n  \n BM   brain metastasis,   RN   radiation necrosis,   N\/A   not applicable.

Asterisks (**) mean patient deceased \n  \n\n\n## fMRI-guided tractography \n  \nImaging was obtained on Siemens Prisma 3-Tesla MRI scanner. MRI protocol included high-resolution T1 and T2 images suitable for surgical navigation and a 64-direction DTI scan (  b  \u2009=\u20091000, 64 directions, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm voxel dimension) for tractography. fMRI protocol included 96 T2* images (TE\/TR\/Voxel Size\/FOV\u2009=\u200930\/2.5\/3.1\u2009\u00d7\u20093.1\u2009\u00d7\u20093\/200\u00a0mm) with fat saturation. Matched-bandwidth high-resolution protocol was acquired at TE\/TR\/Voxel Size\/FOV\u2009=\u200935\/5.0\/1.6\u2009\u00d7\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u20094\/200\u00a0mm, 28 slices. \n\nfMRI studies comprised three language tasks: an object naming and verb generation task, verbal responsive naming task, and auditory responsive naming task per previously described methods [ ,  ]. Coplanar matched-bandwidth T2 images were collected before and after each scan for overlay in interpretation. fMRI preprocessing involved minimal data adjustments except for a 2-mm spatial smoothing kernel. Predicted BOLD correlation (canonical HRF and block design) was computed as Pearson\u2019s   r  . Conjunctive AND combined threshold activation (  r  \u2009=\u20090.2, equivalent to   p  \u2009=\u20090.05) only on all 3 language scans in a set. The resultant activation map included only primary language areas with   p  \u2009<\u20090.000125. Functional maps were then overlaid as 3D objects onto coplanar matched-bandwidth MRI and DTI images using BrainLAB planning software. Deterministic tractography was done using the fMRI activation regions as fiber tract seeds. After the surgeon\u2019s final review and trajectory addition, the completed plan was uploaded into BrainLAB Navigation hardware for surgery. \n\n\n## Operative technique \n  \nPatients were placed in Mayfield head holders and underwent stereotactic registration (Brainlab). Stereotactic accuracy was improved using preoperative CT with Leksell head frame (  n  \u2009=\u20091), bone fiducials (  n  \u2009=\u20092), or intraoperative AIRO CT (  n  \u2009=\u20093). Within the BrainLab Elements station, a predetermined trajectory was planned along the lesion\u2019s long axis. Multiple trajectories were planned if ablation width diameter exceeded 2\u00a0cm. A stereotactic-guided 4.5-mm burr-hole was created. Dura was punctured with a coagulative blunt probe, and stereotactic biopsy was performed. We secured Monteris\u2019 LITT bolt into the burr hole then capped to maintain sterility during MRI transport. At MRI, the laser probe was sterilely driven through the bolt to target using Monteris robotic system. Probe position was confirmed on initial T1 with half-dose gadavist. Once confirmed, safety points were placed by the neuroradiologist (NS) onto the intraprocedural scan to represent the functional areas of activation from the fMRI, and ablation was performed with sequential probe movement until adequate ablation was achieved. A post-ablation T1 MPRAGE was obtained after administering the remaining contrast agent. Upon completion, the patient was returned to the MRI antechamber, the laser probe and bolt were removed, and the incision was closed. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this series, we described our technique for using fMRI as an adjunct in cases with eloquent area lesions to help guide patient selection, operative planning, and intraoperative guidance for LITT. In our workflow, fMRI activation serves as the basis of segmentation of eloquent cortical areas. In contrast to standard, anatomical-based tractography, we use the fMRI validated cortical functional regions as the seeds for the subsequent segmentation of functional tracts. We then used these cortical and subcortical tract segmentations to guide the LITT trajectory and set heat threshold safety points during the ablation. With this approach, we saw good functional outcomes in our six LITT-treated patients without compromising EOA. \n\nSharma et al. [ ] describe another approach to asleep LITT in eloquent areas. Their technique for LITT-ablation of a left thalamic GBM employed intraoperative transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and free-running electromyography (EMG) in a patient with preoperative right-sided weakness. They observed onset of right-sided EMG firing when the real-time temperature at the tumor border encroaching on the posterior limb of the internal capsule reached 40 \u00b0C, at which point they ended the ablation. Their patient had a stable exam apart from new right facial droop, which was not present immediately postoperatively, likely due to developing edema as opposed to direct thermal damage. Del Bene et al. describe their technique for IOM during LITT for lesions near the motor tract [ ]. For preoperative planning, they integrate DTI and magneto-encephalography to serve as a functional tractographic roadmap, similar to how we use fMRI and DTI tractography in our practice. Intraoperatively, in addition to SSEP and MEP monitoring, they performed microelectrode subcortical monopolar stimulation along the planned LITT probe tract to map proximity to motor tracts. From this, they extrapolated the ablation safety radius using the 1\u00a0mA\u2009=\u20091-mm framework. They describe the use of this approach to treat a previously radiated, asymptomatic rolandic BM without any new postoperative deficits. \n\nTwo groups have described their experience with awake LITT. In a 10-patient series, Laurent et al. used thermoplastic masks to facilitate head stabilization during ablation [ ]. They do not comment on proximity to eloquent regions. One patient had an intra-procedural seizure which abated with anti-epileptics, and four patients required rescans following patient movement. Hajtovic et al. report a series of 6 patients with eloquent tumors undergoing intraprocedural monitoring of speech, motor, or visual function every 5-min during ablation [ ]. In this awake series, 5\/6 patients were immobilized in stereotaxic frames. They report no intraoperative seizures or instances of rescanning due to patient movement. Based on these early experiences, awake LITT may be feasible in experienced centers, but not without challenges unique to LITT (e.g., importance of patient immobility) and common to awake neurosurgery more generally (e.g., risk of intraoperative seizures, patient discomfort). \n\nRegardless of approach used for LITT in awake patients, even with accurate targeting and avoidance of direct thermal damage to eloquent structures, some patients do experience delayed neurological dysfunction. Transient cytotoxic edema following ablation is believed to cause temporary perioperative deficits or worsen preexisting deficits [ ,  ,  ], which often necessitates postoperative steroids to resolve [ ,  ,  ]. Within our cohort, 4\/6 patients were on steroids at time of procedure. Steroid treatment was continued post-procedure and tapered gradually. The other two patients were placed on short dexamethasone tapers (<\u20091\u00a0week) post-procedure. None of the patients had to increase dosage or restart steroids after end of taper due to new symptoms. This is an unusual finding, as virtually all the aforementioned studies reported cases of new or worsened perioperative deficits which responded to corticosteroids. Even with the use of awake testing, Hajtovic et al. reported 3\/6 patients experienced delayed neurological deterioration 2\u20133\u00a0weeks post-ablation, which resolved with subsequent steroid treatment. Patients should be advised on the possibility of delayed deficits, and that these often respond to corticosteroids and abate with time. These may be more common in those with preoperative deficits [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nWhile our cohort is small, the utility of adjunct fMRI for pre- and intra-operative planning is promising. Tractography based on fMRI activation can guide safe ablation near eloquent regions without awake testing. Our cohort showed consistent perioperative improvement, with no evidence of permanent neurological deficits. Further studies with larger cohorts and more extensive follow-up periods are required to better understand the long-term outcomes of fMRI as adjunct planning for LITT near eloquent structures. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10844152,"text_md5":"843739fef0081d1d311d8a5796c26f32","field_positions":{"authors":[0,146],"journal":[147,168],"publication_year":[170,174],"title":[185,320],"keywords":[334,441],"abstract":[454,1210],"body":[1219,13533]},"batch":1,"pmid":38316692,"doi":"10.1007\/s00701-024-05970-x","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10844152","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10844152"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10844152\">10844152<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10844152  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as adjunct for planning laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) near eloquent structures"}

The present manuscript describes the sample, the acquisition protocols, the processing pipelines including quality control and standardization, and the applied analysis tools and derived markers of the MRI data of the now-completed population- and patient-based BiDirect cohort study, the latter first described in 2014 by Teismann et al. [ ]. It is an update and extension of the feasibility report published after the first two examination time points and focused on rates and reasons of (non)participation in the MRI sessions [ ]. The present manuscript complements this work by presenting the following: (1) the description of the last two of a total of four examination time points (follow-ups two and three) of the core MRI protocol; (2) the extended MRI data acquisition in a subsample (\u201cplus\u201d protocol) of follow-ups two and three; and (3) the final data handling and processing of the entire MRI data of the study. Another publication related to the descriptions presented here is an evaluation of the performance of the automated lesion segmentation algorithm (BIANCA) in our BiDirect MRI data by Wulms et al. 2022 [ ]. \n\nThe selection of an appropriate acquisition protocol depends on the specific research question and the imaging modality used. The STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE) recommend the use of T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), and T2*-weighted (T2*w) sequences as well as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2w FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as minimally necessary sequences in large-scale epidemiological studies investigating small vessel disease and aging [ ]. \n\nIn addition to selecting an appropriate acquisition protocol, it is important to ensure that the protocol is executed consistently and that data quality is maintained over time. To achieve high-quality results, several quality control measures can be implemented throughout study acquisition, processing, and analysis. Image artifacts such as signal dropouts through motion [ ] or tissue susceptibility variation [ ] and scanner drift [ ] can affect the quality of the data and should be identified and addressed manually or with automated tools such as MRIQC [ ]. In addition, incidental findings should be identified and documented to allow flexible application of inclusion and exclusion criteria depending on the specific research question. \n\nAnother important aspect for reproducibility is the structure of the data [ ]. Complex neuroimaging data offer many opportunities for structuring, processing, and analysis that compromise transparency and reproducibility. Therefore, in addition to a complete description of the acquisition protocol, the use of open software and frameworks is critical for reproducible neuroimaging [ ,  ]. Adherence to a data organization standard, such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification [ ], is also highly recommended for MRI data management. \n\nThe aim of this article is to provide comprehensive information on the MRI data from the monocentric prospective BiDirect study. This includes a detailed description of the sample over time, the imaging protocols, the data organization and quality control measures, and the analysis tools used and markers available. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of M\u00fcnster and the Westphalian Chamber of Physicians in M\u00fcnster, Germany. All participants gave written informed consent. \n\n### Sample description \n  \nThe BiDirect study is a twelve-year monocentric prospective cohort study established to investigate the bidirectional association between subclinical atherosclerosis and depression. Starting in 2010, a cohort of residents (  n   = 911 at baseline) was randomly drawn from the population of M\u00fcnster. A second cohort of participants with diagnosed depression (  n   = 999 at baseline) was recruited from psychiatric hospitals and outpatient services in and around M\u00fcnster. A third cohort of patients with recently diagnosed acute cardiovascular disease was recruited from hospitals and rehabilitation facilities in and around M\u00fcnster (  n   = 347 at baseline) (Table  ). A variety of examinations [ ] were performed, including clinical, psychometric, and socioeconomic assessments as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain [ ]. All data were collected in four study sessions between 2010 and 2021 (Fig.  ). At baseline, participants were between 35 and 65 years of age (Fig.  ).\n   \nDescriptive statistics of the BiDirect study presented stratified by acquisition time point (s0, s2, s4, s6).

Shown are boxplots with the median at each session and dotplots with a bin width of 0.5 years on the left. The color intensity of the distributions shows a confidence interval from 66 to 95% \n  \n\n\n### Acquisition \n  \nMRI of the brain was performed at each of the four examination sessions on the same 3T scanner (Philips Intera with Achieva upgrade, versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3, and 3.2.3) throughout the entire period at the University Department of Radiology, M\u00fcnster University Hospital. The first feasibility report on the BiDirect MRI protocol was published in 2017 [ ], focusing on sequence parameters and the study population in the first two examination sessions. For a detailed overview of the available data per sequence, cohort, and session, see Figs.   and   and Table  .   \nBar chart of available MRI data stratified by session on the   x  -axis and cohort by horizontal subplot.

The   data availability   coloring of the bars shows loss to follow-up (orange), study participation without acquisition of MRI data (blue), and available MRI data (green) \n  \n\n\n### Core MRI protocol \n  \nAs also previously described in a first feasibility report [ ] 3D T1w, T2w FLAIR (T2w sequence with complete cerebrospinal fluid suppression), 2D T2*w, and 2D T2w sequences were used for anatomical imaging. In addition, a DWI sequence and a resting-state functional sequence (72 images at baseline and first follow-up and an extended version with 133 images at third and fourth follow-up) were performed. The parameters of the core protocol are listed in Table  . All data were acquired with a single channel transmit\/receive birdcage head coil.\n   \nMRI acquisition parameters of the core protocol.

The emotion processing task is a short version of a previously published fMRI paradigm investigating neural responsiveness to happy and sad facial expressions in patients with major depression [ \u2013 ]. Facial stimuli consist of happy, sad, and neutral expressions according to Ekman and Friesen [ ]. The passive viewing task with a presentation time of 3\u00a0min is subdivided into 6 blocks of 30\u00a0s each. During the first 20\u00a0s of a block, facial stimuli falling in the same category are presented for 500\u00a0ms each in a random sequence. The remaining 10\u00a0s of a block serve as no-face epoch. The order of blocks is sad-neutral-happy-sad-neutral-happy\n \n\nPrior to this sequence participants were instructed to remain motionless, mainly keep their eyes open, not to fall asleep, and not to think of anything in particular\n \n  \n\n\n### Emotion processing task \n  \nThe emotion processing task was performed only at baseline (s0). It was a short version of a previously published functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm investigating neural responsiveness to happy and sad facial expressions in major depression [ ,  ]. Facial stimuli consisted of sad, happy, and neutral expressions [ ]. Subjects were presented with alternating 20-s epochs of a facial emotion category interleaved with 10-s epochs of a no-face baseline (crosshair). In a passive viewing task, facial stimuli were presented twice per second for 500 ms in a random sequence within each face category. Each 20-s face category epoch was followed by a 10-s no-face epoch and was presented twice, resulting in a total presentation time of 3 min. The order of blocks was sad-neutral-happy-sad-neutral-happy for each participant. For the emotion processing task, T2* functional data were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar sequence, with parameters selected to minimize distortion in the region of central interest, while retaining adequate signal-to-noise ratio and T2* sensitivity. Volumes consisting of 35 slices were acquired (parameters are listed in Table  ). \n\n\n### MRI plus protocol \n  \nFor approximately 200 randomly selected participants in each of the population-based and depression cohorts, an additional MRI protocol (BiDirect Plus, Table  ) with higher-resolution anatomic sequences including 3D T1w, 3D T2w, 3D FLAIR, and 3D (combined) multiecho fast field-echo was performed at follow-ups 2 and 3. Data were acquired using a six-channel phased array head coil. The plus protocol parameters are listed in Table  . \n\n\n### Quality control \n  \nThere was no hardware upgrade after the start of the MRI study. The software updates did not alter the imaging features of the sequences reported here. A routine checkup of the scanner performance consisted of a mainly weekly Periodic Imaging Quality Test (PIQT) applying a vendor-provided head phantom measured in a birdcage head coil. The parameters tested were signal-to-noise ratio, geometric distortion, and floodfield homogeneity. The vendor service was called if the parameters exceeded specific limits defined by the vendor. During the lifetime of the scanner, the highest diagnostic image quality was maintained. Measures of quality control on manual segmentations of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) have been published in [ ]. \n\nAll images were reviewed for incidental findings by (neuro)radiologists in a setting comparable to routine clinical diagnostics. The description of this procedure and the respective results have been previously published in Teuber et al. [ ]. An experienced team of neuroradiologists, neurologists, and epidemiologists met regularly to decide by consensus which findings were clinically relevant and should be reported to the participants [ ]. The presence and nature of all incidental findings were also included in the study database to allow the adaptable application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for all subsequent data analyses. \n\nAll metadata were extracted from the DICOM headers and matched to the BiDirect database to avoid misclassification by ID, age, or sex and to check for deviations from standard MRI protocol (  e.g.  , different resolution, echo time, voxel size). We processed each image using the fully automated MRIQC pipeline [ ] to assess image quality. In addition, we use the \u201cBIDSconvertR\u201d Shiny app [ ] to provide quick visual access to each sequence and participant. \n\n\n### Standardization \n  \nAll MRI data was saved and synchronized weekly in DICOM format. The data was then converted to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative\u00a0and structured into the BIDS specification [ ] using the in-house developed R-package BIDSconvertR [ ]. DICOM images were converted with dcm2niix (Linux; v1.0.20190902 [ ]), and all potentially identifying information was removed from the header. All sequences were renamed and copied to the BIDS specification [ ] and irrelevant sequences (  e.g.  , localizer) were discarded. \n\n\n### Analysis tools and available markers \n  \nStructural and functional markers were derived only from the core protocol using established tools and pipelines (Fig.  , Table  ).   \nNeuroimaging pipelines: input sequence types, frameworks, and functions used \n  \n\n\n### Anatomical pipeline \n  \nT1w data were processed with CAT12 for voxel-based morphometry [ ] in developer mode to allow optional WMHs output. The \u201cfsl_anat pipeline\u201d of FSL (v6.0.3) [ \u2013 ] was used to process defaced T1w and T2w FLAIR images, which were then used to segment WMH in BIANCA [ ,  ]. The fsl_anat-derived bias-corrected T1w images and the native T2w FLAIR\/T2w\/T2star images were extracted from the brain using \u201cfsl_deface.\u201d The T2w-derived brain masks were aligned to T1w space, and the transformation matrix was inverted and applied to the distorted T1w images to bring them into T2w space. The T1w images were downsampled to T2w space to be used with the T2w FLAIR images (required for BIANCA) for WMH segmentation. All 2D T2-weighted sequences (T2w, T2*w, T2w FLAIR) have the same resolution and voxel size. The brain mask was then realigned using the transformation matrix and applied to the bias-corrected T2-weighted sequences. Cortical thickness was calculated using Freesurfer (release v6.0 and v7.1.0,  ). A user-defined function was used to extract all variables from the whole brain and specific regions of interest (ROIs) using different atlases. \n\n\n### WMH segmentation \n  \nTwo raters manually segmented WMHs in 201 T2w FLAIR images from the population-based cohort. These gold standard lesion segmentations were used to evaluate the performance of the automated lesion segmentation algorithm (BIANCA) as previously described by Wulms et al. [ ]. We decided to use BIANCA after comparing the robustness of various white matter segmentation tools with respect to lesion volume estimation, which can be read here [ ]. FSL BIANCA [ ] was then trained with brain-extracted bias-corrected fsl_anat images (T1w, T2w FLAIR, same space, manual masks) based on the manually segmented lesion masks. The trained model was then applied to all other T1w and T2w FLAIR images (also bias-corrected, brain-extracted, in T2w FLAIR space) in the data set. The total lesion volume and lesion number were extracted from each image. \n\n\n### Diffusion-weighted imaging \n  \nDWI data were processed with PSMD marker (v1.5) [ ] to calculate the peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) and mean skeletonized mean diffusivity (MSMD) values. The PSMD value and MSMD value were extracted, and the temporary file output argument was used to extract native and normalized fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images, as well as the skeletonized FA and MP maps for TBSS (tract-based spatial statistics). The normalized images were then used to extract mean FA and MD from the whole brain, white matter masks, TBSS images, and four ROI masks (MNI152 atlas: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital). \n\n\n### Functional imaging pipeline \n  \nFor the emotion processing task, a standard processing pipeline in SPM12 ( ) was implemented. Functional imaging data were motion-corrected, spatially normalized to standard MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space, and smoothed (Gaussian kernel, 8-mm FWHM (full width at half maximum)). For each subject, trials were averaged for each emotion condition. Brain responses to the emotion stimulus categories were isolated by convolving a vector of onset times of the sad, happy, neutral, and no-face conditions with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Two individual 1st level contrast images (happy-neutral, sad-neutral) were generated for 2nd level group statistics. Resting-state sequences were pre- and post-processed using fMRIPrep [ ] using standard settings that deviate from the protocol only by turning off Freesurfer processing and usage (for detailed information, see supplementary material: fMRIprep boilerplate). Alternative postprocessing was performed in specific data analysis projects [ ]. \n\n\n### Software and hardware \n  \nUbuntu 18.04 LTS was used as the operating system. We also used locally installed versions of MATLAB (R2018b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), with SPM12 [ ] including the CAT12 toolbox (r1742) [ ], FSL (v6.0.3) [ \u2013 ], and Freesurfer (v6.0 and v7.1.0). We used pipelines for quality control and functional preprocessing in Dockerized versions: MRIQC (v0.16.0) [ ] and fMRIPrep (v20.2.1) [ ]. File management and FSL functions were wrapped and parallelized [ ,  ] using the tidyverse library [ ] in R (v4.2.1) [ ]. CAT12 and PSMD computations were performed on a Dell Thinkstation-P520, Intel\u00ae Xeon(R) W-2125 (4.00GHz \u00d7 8 cores), 16 Gb DDR4-Ram. Freesurfer calculations were performed on a Dell Thinkstation-P500, Intel\u00ae Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 (3.50GHz \u00d7 12 cores), 16 Gb DDR4-Ram. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample description \n  \nThe distribution of age per cohort and study population is shown in Fig.  . With all 4 study waves, BiDirect comprises a total of 6895 study examinations (49% women) with 4,315 MRI core protocols (53%) and 752 MRI plus protocols (56% women) (Figs.   and  , Tables   and  ). In total,   n   = 320 of the population cohort and   n   = 200 of the depression cohort participated in all 4 MRI sessions of the core protocol (Fig.  , Table  ).\n   \nDescriptive statistics of available MRI data. The table shows the available data (expressed as a percentage of the total study population) by cohort and acquisition time point (s0, s2, s4, s6) \n  \n n   (% at session, cross-sectional proportion)\n \n  \n\nDue to termination through participants, technical reasons, motion artifacts, or altered parameters, some sequences were missing or discarded. Further information on contraindications and other reasons for nonparticipation in MRI examinations are listed in the MRI feasibility report of the BiDirect study [ ]. During the 12 years of follow-up, starting from a study population of 2,257 participants, 842 participants (37%) were lost resulting in 1,415 participants at the last follow-up (Fig.\u00a0 ). Regarding MRI data, 1,460 MRI sequences were acquired at baseline and 846 MRI sequences were acquired at the last follow-up, resulting in 614 participants (42%) lost to follow-up. \n\nThe population cohort with MRI lost 74 participants (11%) between baseline (s0) and first follow-up (s2), 198 participants (29%) between baseline (s0) and second follow-up (s4), and 189 participants (28%) between baseline and third follow-up (s6). The depression cohort with MRI lost 290 participants (39%) between baseline (s0) and first follow-up (s2), 412 participants (56%) between baseline (s0) and second follow-up (s4), and 433 participants (59%) between baseline and third follow-up (s6). The CVD cohort with MRI gained 38 participants (73%) between baseline (s0) and first follow-up (s2), 25 participants (48%) between baseline (s0) and second follow-up (s4), and 8 participants (15%) between baseline and third follow-up (s6). \n\n\n### Acquisition and processing \n  \nThe parameters of the MRI core protocol are listed in Table   and have previously been published in the BiDirect MRI feasibility report by Teuber et al.

WMH lesion segmentation pipelines extracted measures of lesion volume, lesion count, and the actual three-dimensional lesion map. In addition, diffusion-weighted imaging pipelines extracted measures of microstructural integrity, including fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe BiDirect study features a unique combination of three cohorts of middle-aged men and women captured across four examinations over twelve years. Compared with other cohort studies using cerebral MRI, it is at the upper end of the sample size range [ ] with a total number 6,895 imaging sequences from 1,460 subjects (672 from the general population, 736 with depression, and 52 with cardiovascular disease) with MRI data at baseline. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) collected data from 1,100 volunteer participants starting in 2010 [ ]. The prospective Rotterdam Scan Study examined imaging markers from 5,286 population-based participants from the Ommoord neighborhood in Rotterdam. The German National Cohort recruited 205,000 participants at 18 study sites in Germany [ ] via population registers. At baseline, 56,971 participants underwent in-depth phenotyping and 30,861 of them participated in 3-T MRI of the brain [ ]. The German Rhineland Study also targets 30,000 subjects [ ]. The UK Biobank collected data from about 500,000 volunteer participants and in 2014 began inviting 100,000 of those original volunteers for brain, heart, and body imaging [ ]. Imaging data from 10,000 volunteers has already been processed and made available [ ]. \n\nRegarding follow-up losses, the population cohort lost 218 participants (24%) between baseline (s0,   n  \u2009=\u2009911) and last follow-up (s6,   n  \u2009=\u2009693). Among participants with MRI, there was a loss of 189 participants (28%, s0\u2009=\u2009672 and s6\u2009=\u2009483). In comparison, the Rotterdam Scan Study showed a decrease from 3,932 participants (2,956 with MRI) to 3,122 participants (1,854 with MRI) over 10 years from 2005 to 2015 [ ], corresponding to a loss to follow-up of 810 participants (21%) from the total cohort and of 1,102 participants with MRI (37%). \n\nThe cardiovascular disease cohort lost 127 participants (37%) between baseline (s0,   n  \u2009=\u2009347) and last follow-up (s6,   n  \u2009=\u2009220). However, they gained 8 participants with MRI (15%) between s0 (  n  \u2009=\u200952) and s6 (  n  \u2009=\u200960). This gain resulted from contraindications, such as newly implanted coronary stents, which made them temporarily unavailable for MRI [ ]. However, all participants were given the opportunity to participate in an MRI session at a subsequent follow-up visit. \n\nThe depression cohort lost 497 participants (50%) between baseline (s0,   n  \u2009=\u2009999) and last follow-up (s6,   n  \u2009=\u2009502). Among participants with MRI, there was a loss of 189 participants (59%, s0\u2009=\u2009736 and s6\u2009=\u2009303). This 1.4- to 2.4-fold higher probability of dropout compared with the population-based cohort was expected because of the underlying disease [ ]. \n\nIn BiDirect, we used T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted sequences to measure anatomic features and white matter connectivity. Thus, the MRI protocol complies with STRIVE criteria [ ]. We also acquired two functional sequences, a task-based paradigm with emotional faces (baseline only) and a resting-state sequence. WMH were extracted using BIANCA, a widely used and validated tool [ ,  ]. During the study period, higher-resolution imaging techniques were increasingly used in routine clinical practice [ ]. In follow-up visits 2 and 3, we therefore added high-resolution imaging sequences for a subcohort of approximately 400 participants. \n\nAll MRI data from the BiDirect study were standardized to BIDS using the BIDSconvertR [ ]. The BIDS specification [ ] is a widely used tool for organizing neuroimaging data that is being actively developed by the BIDS consortium. We applied easy-to-use, widely available, and open-access pipelines (  e.g.  , BIDS apps [ ]) developed for or adapted to BIDS structured data to improve the reproducibility of our data. \n\nThe study is associated with certain limitations. The sequences used were not updated during the study period and were therefore increasingly outdated, except for the plus protocol. We did this intentionally to ensure optimal comparability over time. In addition, the T2w images were not acquired at baseline. Moreover, given the large number of images acquired, we did not perform manual quality control or image quality assessment. This is left to the individual scientist for each specific project. \n\nThe present manuscript also needs to be distinguished from previous work, mainly the MRI feasibility report by Teuber et al. [ ], which presented the MRI data acquisition of the first two examination time points together with the rates and reasons of MRI non-participation, as well as the report on the evaluation of the performance of the automated lesion segmentation algorithm (BIANCA) in our MRI data by Wulms et al. [ ]. \n\nThe BiDirect study comprises a thoroughly phenotyped study population with structural and functional MRI data. The imaging data is standardized to the BIDS specification and already processed with the most common analysis tools. Both the images and the MRI markers are available for collaboration and sharing. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10853141,"text_md5":"04b1b4e3de9744f2a8077557025efdf2","field_positions":{"authors":[0,177],"journal":[178,192],"publication_year":[194,198],"title":[209,348],"keywords":[362,469],"abstract":[482,2697],"body":[2706,29949]},"batch":1,"pmid":38332362,"doi":"10.1186\/s41747-023-00415-z","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10853141","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10853141"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10853141\">10853141<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10853141  Cerebral MRI in a prospective cohort study on depression and atherosclerosis: the BiDirect sample, processing pipelines, and analysis tools"}

These disorders may lead to sensory and motion disorders, causing considerable psychological distress. Recent studies found that virtual reality (VR) technology can be an effective tool for treating spinal cord injuries. Owing to this discovery, we developed an exploratory research project to investigate the impact of this intervention on the postoperative recovery of patients with CSM. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of combining VR technology with conventional rehabilitation strategies for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. A total of 78 patients will be recruited and randomized to either the conventional rehabilitation group or the group subjected to VR technology combined with conventional rehabilitation strategies. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale will be the main tool used, and secondary outcomes will be measured via the visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and functional MRI (fMRI). The data analysis will identify differences between the intervention and control groups as well as any relationship between the intragroup changes in the functional area of the brain and the subjective scale scores after the intervention. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of VR training on the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM after 12 intervention treatments. Positive and negative outcomes will help us better understand the effectiveness of the intervention and its neural impact. If effective, this study could provide new options for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \nChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300071544). Registered 17 May 2023,  . \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186\/s13063-024-07962-9. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nCervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a spinal cord disease characterized by degenerative changes in the cervical spine, such as degenerative disc disease, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and hypertrophy of the yellow ligament. These changes can cause the surrounding blood vessels and nerve structures to become compressed, thus leading to a range of sensory and motor symptoms. The clinical symptoms included limb weakness, gait instability, and diminished sensory and motor function. In severe cases, quadriplegia can occur. Moreover, CSM is more common in middle-aged and elderly individuals older than 55 years [ ]. In North America, the incidence and prevalence of CSM are at least 41 and 605 per million people, respectively, while in East Asian countries, the hospitalization rate for patients with CSM is 4.04 per 100,000 person-years [ ,  ]. With social progress, technological advancements, and changes in human lifestyles and work patterns, the incidence of CSM is increasing annually, particularly in young people [ ]. Surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with middle and advanced stage disease [ ]. However, some postoperative CSM patients still experience sensory and motor disorders, such as lower limb weakness, gait instability, and numbness, which need to be addressed. With the development of neuroimaging, researchers studying brain plasticity found that CSM could lead to brain plasticity, which plays an important role in functional recovery after surgery for CSM [ ]. A deeper understanding of the development of CSM-related brain plasticity is highly important for developing appropriate rehabilitation plans and improving clinical efficacy. \n\nThe central nervous system (CNS) has been confirmed to be able to reorganize structurally and functionally after injury, enabling repair through neuroplasticity [ ]. Brain plasticity is the brain\u2019s ability to modify its structure and function to adapt to environmental changes and experiences [ ]. Researchers revealed that the recovery of neural function in CSM patients depends on both spinal cord compression and injury as well as brain function reorganization or plasticity [ ]. Moreover, cortical plasticity compensates for some function by involving brain regions that are not primarily involved in a specific task [ ]. Therefore, when spinal cord injury occurs, cortical plasticity also occurs. Sabbah, P. et al. discovered that cortical reorganization, either physically or via mental imagery, could activate the lower limb cortical network years after injury and is therefore an adaptive remodelling response known as cortical-spinal neural plasticity [ ]. Liu, M. et al. conducted a study using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on 41 CSM patients both before and after surgery and compared the VBM measurements to those of a control group [ ]. They assessed the changes in the cortical grey matter volumes in CSM patients before and after surgery and found that, compared to those in the control group, the grey matter volumes in the left caudate nucleus and the right thalamus were lower in the preoperative CSM patients. Six months after surgery, the bilateral grey matter volume in the posterior cerebellar lobes decreased in the postoperative CSM patients, while the grey matter volume in the brainstem was greater than that in the preoperative CSM patients. Compared to the control group, the postoperative CSM patients in the present study had a significantly lower grey matter volume in the left caudate nucleus but higher grey matter volumes in the right inferior temporal gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and bilateral lingual gyri\/cuneus\/precuneus cortex. Therefore, based on the scientific theory of brain plasticity, it is important to select appropriate methods to regulate the CNS and promote spinal cord recovery after surgery to ensure the smooth rehabilitation of CSM patients. In recent years, VR technology has been increasingly applied in clinical treatment, particularly for incomplete spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and other areas, to promote rehabilitation through brain remodelling [ \u2013 ]. This technology could also be a potential therapeutic option for CSM patients after surgery. \n\nVR technology is a tool that allows users to create and experience computer-generated 3D environments and interact with various objects in real time through visual, auditory, or tactile feedback. VR is a simulated 3D interactive system with dynamic scenes and entity behaviours that allows the integration of multiple sources of information such as scene displays, force\/tactile sensors, and position trackers. Motion training has shown promise in that patients can become immersed in virtual environments, thereby providing a pleasant and exciting experience for users. Multisensory stimulation provided by VR can potentially promote the reshaping and reconstruction of the central nervous system, improving gait instability. Kirsch, P et al. used fMRI technology to demonstrate that monetary rewards produced greater brain activation than verbal rewards, suggesting that the type of reward has a strong stimulating effect on brain activity [ ]. Animal and human neuroimaging studies have shown that reward delivery is associated with the activation of the subcortical edge and anterior brain areas, including the substantia nigra, thalamus, striatum, orbital frontal cortex, insula, and precentral gyrus. The activation of these relevant brain regions through the reward system may lead to brain reshaping. The degree of motor function recovery depends on the extent of neural population reshaping induced by the intervention. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that VR can induce cortical reshaping of motor pathways, including the primary sensory motor cortex, SMA, cerebellum, precentral gyrus, and ipsilateral and contralateral marginal gyri, through visual, auditory, and tactile feedback [ ]. This approach creates a realistic environment and provides a safe and stimulating learning environment for subjects. By stimulating brain plasticity through a large number of movement repetitions and multisensory methods, brain reshaping mechanisms can be used to reconstruct gait. \n\n### Study aim \n  \nThe main objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. The secondary objective was to explore the potential patterns of cortical plasticity related to sensory and motor function recovery in CSM patients via pre- and postintervention fMRI and longitudinal JOA studies to provide a theoretical basis for investigating the central role of virtual reality training in promoting brain plasticity in patients who have undergone surgery for cervical spondylosis. \n\n\n\n## Method\/design \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThe aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) technology in the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. A total of 78 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either the routine rehabilitation group or the VR training combined with routine rehabilitation group (1:1). The primary outcome will be measured with the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) (Table  ) cervical myelopathy evaluation scale, and the secondary measures will include the visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans [ \u2013 ]. The intervention will be implemented in accordance with a standardized protocol, and independent researchers will execute and supervise the random allocation of patients in the trial. The study protocol is in compliance with the SPIRIT recommendation. For the SPIRIT checklist, see Additional file  , and the study design is presented in Figs.   and  .

Abbreviations: JOA, Japanese Orthopaedic Association; NDI, Neck Disability Index; VAS, visual analogue scale; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThe aim of this study was to recruit 78 patients who underwent surgery for CSM, with JOA scores between 5 and 15 and aged between 20 and 75 years. All eligible participants will be recruited from the orthopaedic and rehabilitation medicine departments of our hospital and other hospitals. The study was conducted at multiple centres, including Shanghai Longhua Hospital, Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Shanghai Shuguang Hospital, Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Both of these hospitals are located in Shanghai, China. Prior to the experiment, we provided a comprehensive explanation of the study\u2019s purpose, type of intervention, and potential risks and benefits of using VR technology to the participants who consented to participate. We will respect their decision to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. At the same time, we maintained regular contact with participants, created incentives, provided personalised designs, simplified experiment procedures, and increased communication and engagement to increase loyalty and participation and to ensure that the experiment would be successful. \n\n\n\n## Enrolment \n  \n### Inclusion criteria \n  \nAll participants who met the following criteria were included: (1) diagnosed with CSM and underwent surgery between 24 h and 3 months prior to enrolment; (2) aged between 20 and 75 years of either sex; (3) a Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score of 5 to 15; (4) no less than a primary school education; (5) no cognitive dysfunction; and (6) understood the study, agreed to participate in the study, and signed the informed consent form. \n\n\n### Exclusion criteria \n  \nParticipants were excluded if they met any of the following conditions: (1) contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (such as a cardiac pacemaker, cardiac stent, artificial heart valve, bone fracture fixation plate, or claustrophobia); (2) concurrent limb fractures, degenerative diseases of the lumbar or thoracic vertebrae, cerebrovascular disease, other neurological disorders, intraspinal space-occupying lesions, history of cervical trauma, previous cervical spine surgery, hip or knee joint diseases, or other serious systemic diseases; (3) severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction; or (4) pregnant or lactating. \n\n\n### Withdrawal or dropout criteria \n  \nIn this study, the intervention measures for both the trial group and the control group may be stopped if the subject meets any of the following criteria: (1) the subject requests to withdraw from the clinical study; (2) the subject is unable to complete the relevant test as needed, which affects the data collection; (3) the subject receives other treatments during the treatment period without authorization; (4) the subject experiences adverse events or serious adverse events during the trial that require their withdrawal from the study; (5) the subject experiences significant worsening of the disease, complications or special physiological changes that require their withdrawal from the study; (6) the researcher considers it unsuitable for the subject to continue participating in this study. \n\n\n### Who will provide informed consent? \n  \nAll eligible postoperative patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) were informed about the methods and objectives of this study as well as the potential benefits and risks involved. Patients were provided with an informed consent form for review and signing. \n\n\n### Intervention \n  \nInterventions using VR technology were conducted on the GRAIL system (Netherlands Motek Medical Company SY02097646), with all participants undergoing diagnostic assessment by a professional spine specialist or rehabilitation medicine physician prior to participation to ensure suitability. The training time was scheduled in accordance with the GRAIL guidelines to ensure that the VR intervention was appropriate and safe, as it has been shown to be the most effective intensity of training for patients with CSM. All intervention measures were implemented by qualified therapists, and the participants\u2019 reactions were recorded after each intervention. Safety measures were taken to prevent harm to all participants. \n\n\n### Conventional rehabilitation group \n  \nPatients in the rehabilitation group underwent a programme that focused primarily on strength training to improve their performance ability and coordination [ ]. The postoperative limb muscle strength, sensation, and motor function of patients was assessed to develop a functional training program based on existing problems. The program included the following exercises: (1) finger extension and forceful bending and gripping movements were repeated 5\u201310 times, and the frequency of training sessions was appropriately increased. (2) Patients were guided in performing active knee and hip joint movements 3 times a week for 15 min each 24 h after surgery. (3) Straight leg lift exercises were performed 2 times a week for 15 min each. (4) Isometric contraction exercises, such as those involving the quadriceps femoris, were performed 3 times a week for 10 min each. (5) Ankle joint dorsiflexion and plantar flexion exercises were performed 3 times a week for 15\u201320 min each. (6) Walking training was performed 3 times a week for 10\u201320 min each time. \n\n\n### Conventional rehabilitation and virtual reality training group \n  \nThe same specific plan as previously described was used for conventional rehabilitation treatment. Additionally, virtual reality technology was used to supplement the GRAIL procedure. The treatment plan involved instructing patients to perform corresponding activities on a treadmill while being suspended by a harness and surrounded by suitable virtual scenes. The frequency of treatment was three times a week, with each session lasting 15\u201320 min. This treatment lasted for 4 weeks, during which time a doctor was present to guide and monitor the patient throughout the sessions. \n\nThe virtual reality rehabilitation sessions will be conducted using a commercially available VR system. Participants in the intervention group will wear a VR headset and engage in various virtual reality activities that target specific motor and functional aspects affected by CSM. These activities will include exercises and games designed to improve range of motion, strength, coordination, and balance. \n\n\n### Outcomes \n  \nPrior to the intervention, individuals who expressed interest in participating in the study were invited to schedule an appointment for additional information. \n\nIf they choose to participate, they will sign an informed consent form and be screened by independent researchers to determine if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be included in the study. Descriptive data, including general information such as age, sex, race, occupation, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, education level, medical history, medication use, smoking status, drug use, and alcohol consumption, will be carefully collected before randomization. In addition, all participants were assessed using three scales: the JOA, the VAS, and the NDI. \n\nBoth the intervention group and the control group completed a total of 12 rehabilitation sessions over a period of 4 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed immediately after the 4-week intervention period and compared with baseline data. The primary outcome will be the change in functional ability, assessed using a standardized functional assessment tool (JOA score). The secondary outcome measures will include pain level (VAS score), neck disability (NDI score), and changes in the functional areas of the brain. \n\n\n### Measurements \n  \nFigure   lists the schedule of all study assessments and the timeframe in detail. The assessments are described briefly below: \n\n#### Primary outcome measurement \n  \nThe primary outcome measure was the change in the JOA score for the cervical spine. The JOA score consists of a total of 17 points, with 4 points each for upper and lower limb motor function, 2 points each for upper and lower limb and trunk sensation, and 3 points each for bladder function. Patients were assessed using the JOA score before intervention, after intervention, and during follow-up in accordance with the JOA evaluation criteria for cervical spine disease treatment established by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. The results were categorized into five groups: > 75% excellent, 50\u201374% good, 20\u201349% fair, 0\u201319% no change, and < 0 deterioration. \n\n\n#### Secondary outcome measures \n  \nThe secondary outcome measures consisted of the VAS score, NDI score, and neuroimaging data. The data will be collected at the baseline assessment and at the end of the intervention (4 weeks after randomization). \n\n\n#### Visual analogue scale (VAS) \n  \nThe VAS pain consists of a 100-mm horizontal line with the words \u201cno pain\u201d and \u201cworst possible pain\u201d at the line\u2019s ends. Patients were asked to quantify their neck pain by drawing a vertical mark on the area of the horizontal line that best represented their pain level during the preceding 24 h. \n\n\n#### Neck disability index (NDI) score \n  \nThe NDI measures disability related to neck pain and includes 10 items related to neck pain intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headache, concentration, working, sleeping, driving, and recreation. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe disability. The results are interpreted as follows: 0\u201320% indicates mild disability, 21\u201340% indicates moderate disability, 41\u201360% indicates severe disability, 61\u201380% indicates very severe disability, and 81\u2013100% indicates complete disability or the need for further examination to rule out symptom exaggeration. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging scans \n  \nThe data for this study were collected at the Radiology Department of Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, which is affiliated with the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Participants were positioned in the supine position, and their heads were secured using a specially designed head mask. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed using a Siemens Magnetom Verio 3. T MRI scanner. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were obtained using a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with interleaved scanning of 43 slices, a flip angle of 90\u00b0, a matrix of 64 \u00d7 64, a TR of 300 ms, a slice thickness of 3.0 mm, an FOV of 230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230\u00a0mm , and a gap of (voxel size of 3.6 \u00d7 3.6 \u00d7 3.0 mm ). T1-weighted structural scans were obtained using a weighted fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) sequence with TR\/TI\/TE of 190\/900\/2.93 ms, a flip angle of 9\u00b0, an FOV of 256 \u00d7 256 mm , a slice thickness of 1.0 mm, a matrix of 256 \u00d7 256, and an average of 1.0. All assessments involving scales and MRI scans were conducted prior to the intervention and then repeated after 4 weeks of intervention. \n\n\n\n### Safety assessment \n  \nAny adverse events such as discomfort caused by MRI procedures, headache, or VR training that cannot be tolerated will be recorded throughout the intervention period and reported to the ethics committee to ensure safety. Operators conducting GRAIL procedures should be familiar with the trial protocol and procedures related to safety, and ethics must strictly follow the Grail operation guidelines. In case of an adverse event during the intervention, the participant will receive appropriate medical care, and all the details will be recorded and reported to the principal investigator and ethics committee to determine if the participate should continue the trial. All collected adverse events will be truthfully reported in future publications, and the incidence rate of adverse events will also be considered in the analysis. \n\n\n### Sample size calculation \n  \nThe goal of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of VR technology in the rehabilitation of patients with CSM after surgery. Due to a lack of research on the effect of VR technology on the rehabilitation of CSM patients after surgery, we conducted a small-sample pilot study. The sample size was estimated based on the improvement in JOA scores for cervical spondylosis reported by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. One month after surgery, the average JOA scores and SDs for the VR rehabilitation intervention group (  n   = 10) and the conventional rehabilitation group (  n   = 10) were 15.30 (SD = 0.90) and 14.7 (SD = 0.78), respectively, with an effect size (Cohen\u2019s   D  ) of 0.71. Using the Gpower 3.1 software, we calculated the needed sample size, which, with a type I error of   \u03b1   = 0.05 and a type II error of   \u03b2   = 0.2, was estimated to be a sample size of   n   = 64. Considering a dropout rate of 20%, 39 participants were needed for each group, for a total of 78 participants. Finally, we randomly allocated the 78 participants into a VR training combined with rehabilitation intervention group and a conventional rehabilitation group, each consisting of 39 participants. \n\n\n### Randomization and allocation concealment \n  \nAfter the baseline evaluation, each eligible participant was randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group at a 1:1 ratio. The random allocation cards will be generated using the random permutation principle with a random number table generated by SPSS21. These cards will be placed in opaque envelopes, with the envelope numbers corresponding to the card numbers. The envelopes will be opened in the order of the participants\u2019 visits, and the participants will be randomly assigned to either the conventional rehabilitation group or the conventional rehabilitation combined with VR training group based on the grouping specified on the card inside the envelope. This method of random allocation will ensure that the assignment is unbiased and that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to either group. \n\n\n\n## Blinding \n  \n### Who will be blinded \n  \nFor this trial, the individuals responsible for brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collection and analysis were kept blinded. A physiotherapist who was involved in the treatment of spinal disorders and belonged to the same institution as the first author was the therapist. Patients, therapists, and evaluators were not blinded to the treatment group to which the patients had been allocated. \n\n\n### Procedure for unblinding \n  \nThe unblinding procedure was conducted at the completion of the trial or at the specified endpoint. An independent unblinding committee composed of experts unrelated to the study was established. The committee members were blinded to the allocation of participants throughout the trial to maintain independence and objectivity. A detailed unblinding plan, including the timing, sequence, and identity verification process of unblinded participants, was developed and approved by the ethics committee of Yueyang Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine prior to trial initiation. Randomization codes and group assignments were securely stored by an independent data manager or committee member. The unblinding process was executed by members of the unblinding committee or by authorized individuals; this process involved the verification of participants\u2019 group assignments and the provision of treatment codes or the decryption of treatment groups. After unblinding, the data analysts analysed the data and interpreted the trial results based on the unblinded data, including comparisons and assessments of statistical significance between the treatment and control groups. \n\n\n### Data collection and management \n  \nInitially, the screening personnel reviewed the inclusion and exclusion criteria and collected basic characteristic data prior to random allocation. Trained assessors, who are blinded to the allocation and not involved in the intervention, will play a crucial role in measuring the primary and secondary outcomes. The data for all participants will be recorded in a designed case report form (CRF). Additionally, each CRF will be checked twice to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data collection throughout the study. All relevant documents will be coded with specific identification numbers and kept in a secure, locked box to safeguard the privacy and data safety of the subjects. The magnetic resonance scans obtained during the study will be saved on a computer with restricted access and a password known only to the principal investigator. The materials will be securely stored in compliance with medical records retention regulations and good clinical practice principles for 5 years after the trial. The study will also be monitored for safety by a physical therapist and two clinical doctors who are not involved in the research. The researchers will ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs), monitor the study\u2019s progress, review all adverse events, and discontinue the trial if any measures cause significant adverse effects such as headache, nausea, or vomiting. The assessors reported any adverse events to the   data monitoring committee   (DMC) and the ethics committee of Yueyang Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. DMC is independent from the sponsor and competing interests. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll nonimaging data will be analysed using SPSS version 21 by an independent statistician who is blinded to the treatment and control groups to ensure objectivity and reduce bias. The statistical significance level for testing will be set at 0.05 with a two-tailed test. Continuous variables are presented as the mean, standard deviation, or maximum or minimum values based on their statistical distributions. Independent sample   t   tests or nonparametric tests (Mann\u2013Whitney   U   test) will be used to compare the results presented as continuous variables and mean values to validate the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, intra- and intergroup comparisons were made at 4 weeks to observe the differences between the two intervention methods. If necessary, logistic regression, general linear correlation, or regression was used to compare different types of results based on the variable type and distribution. Basic data comparisons between the treatment and control groups will be performed using   t   tests, chi-square tests, or nonparametric tests. Participants who drop out during the intervention period will not be excluded according to the intention-to-treat principle, and missing data will be replaced using the last observation carried forward method to maintain statistical power and avoid bias. \n\nThe amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) is an indicator of the amplitude energy of the low-frequency spectrum and reflects the spontaneous activity of neurons in the resting state of the brain. The ALFF is a useful tool for analysing functional MRI data to study longitudinal neural changes and explore the relationship between brain plasticity and the recovery of sensory and motor function induced by stimulation [ ]. In this study, the REST 1.9 software from Beijing Normal University ( ) was used to perform linear drift and calculate the amplitude of signal oscillation in each voxel in the low-frequency range (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) to obtain ALFF images. Finally, the ALFF values of each participant were   Z  -transformed for further statistical analysis. \n\nLongitudinal measurements in a resting-state task and further correlation analysis of imaging and scale score data obtained from baseline and postintervention measurements were performed to explore the relationships between brain remodelling and postoperative sensory and motor function recovery in CSM patients. \n\n\n### Protocol amendments \n  \nThis trial will be conducted in accordance with Protocol Version 1.0. Any modifications to the protocol will be formally amended and submitted to the Ethics Committee of Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Any deviations from the protocol will be documented and reported to the Ethics Committee. \n\n\n### Dissemination plans \n  \nThe results of this study will be accessible in peer-reviewed publications and presented at academic conferences. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCSM is the most severe type of cervical spondylosis, and in severe cases, it can lead to paralysis. Surgery is the only reliable solution for patients with advanced CSM who suffer from severe sensory and motor dysfunction, such as lower limb weakness, limb numbness, unstable gait, and limited fine motor activity of the hands. However, even after relieving the pressure on the spinal cord caused by prolonged compression, damaged nerve function may not fully and quickly recover. As a result, residual sensory and motor impairments after surgery can cause significant psychological stress. Rehabilitation is considered an important component of recovery in many neurological disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and spinal cord injury (SCI) [ ,  ,  ]. Despite these findings, there has been a lack of clinical research promoting rehabilitation for CSM patients [ ]. New evidence suggests that rehabilitation strategies may have a substantial impact on the recovery of CSM patients, and existing rehabilitative interventions for traumatic SCI and stroke may be applicable due to their similar pathophysiology [ ]. Various rehabilitation methods can be used for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM, such as gait training, hand function training, and VR training. The latter is particularly interesting due to its multisensory stimulation, which promotes brain reshaping and functional recovery, integrating traditional gait training into more enjoyable VR training. Additionally, numerous technologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation, have been rapidly developed as noninvasive neuroregulation techniques. These techniques have been widely used in the clinical treatment of various neurological disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic pain, depression, and addiction, with promising results [ \u2013 ]. No relevant literature on postoperative neuroregulation treatments for CSM patients at the brain functional level have been found. However, we believe that using noninvasive neuroregulation techniques to purposefully regulate brain function after effective cervical spine surgery decompression could be highly important for improving its short-term efficacy and the long-term recovery of CSM patients. One potential limitation of this trial is that it was not a double-blind controlled trial. Although we attempted to blind everyone, this approach is not always feasible in nonpharmacological studies, and we cannot expect participants in the trial to pretend to be blind to the recovery treatment or to the therapists and clinicians [ ]. However, throughout the trial, outcome assessors or statisticians will be blinded to the study design to eliminate any potential bias. \n\nOverall, the aim of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate the potential of 12 sessions of VR stimulation in promoting gait stability while also seeking to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this stimulation. This research will fill the research gap regarding the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with cervical spondylosis using VR training. These positive results from our trial may provide new treatment options and evidence for improving gait instability. \n\n\n## Trial status \n  \nThis is version 2.0 of the protocol, dated 30 May 2023. Participant recruitment began on 7 June 2023. Recruitment is predicted to continue until December 2024. Currently, recruitment is still ongoing at the time of submission. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10877862,"text_md5":"a2ca71c7a170c55b4017818aeb90e0ea","field_positions":{"authors":[0,142],"journal":[143,149],"publication_year":[151,155],"title":[166,352],"keywords":[366,499],"abstract":[512,2598],"body":[2607,35322]},"batch":1,"pmid":38374040,"doi":"10.1186\/s13063-024-07962-9","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10877862","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10877862"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10877862\">10877862<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10877862  The efficacy of virtual reality technology for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial"}

This bias is often accompanied by heightened amygdala activity in patients with BPD as compared to healthy controls. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies exploring differences between patients and healthy controls in facial emotion processing have produced divergent results. The current study explored fMRI and heart rate variability (HRV) correlates of negative facial emotion processing in patients with BPD and healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study included 30 patients with BPD (29 females; age: M\u2009=\u200924.22, SD\u2009=\u20095.22) and 30 healthy controls (29 females; M\u2009=\u200924.66, SD\u2009=\u20095.28). All participants underwent the \u201cfaces\u201d task, an emotional face perception task, in an fMRI session simultaneously with ECG. In this task, participants are presented with emotional expressions of disgust, sadness, and fear (as a negative condition) and with the same pictures in a scrambled version (as a neutral condition). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found no differences in brain activity between patients with BPD and healthy controls when processing negative facial expressions as compared to neutral condition. We observed activation in large-scale brain areas in both groups when presented with negative facial expressions as compared to neutral condition. Patients with BPD displayed lower HRV than healthy controls in both conditions. However, there were no significant associations between HRV and amygdala activity and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of this study indicate no abnormal brain activity during emotional facial processing in patients with BPD. This result contrasts with previous studies and more studies are needed to clarify the relationship between facial emotion processing and brain activity in patients with BPD. Possible reasons for the absence of brain activity differences are discussed in the study. Consistent with previous findings, patients showed lower HRV than healthy controls. However, HRV was not associated with amygdala activity and BPD symptoms. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nEmotional dysregulation, usually described as an inability to control and regulate one\u2019s affective state, is one of the core features in borderline personality disorder (BPD) [ ]. It is linked with difficulties in the personal experience of emotion and with the perception of emotion in others [ ,  ]. Given that facial expressions are fundamental emotional stimuli for everyday social functioning [ ], biased processing of emotional faces in patients with BPD may lead to frequently observed maladaptive behaviors and interpersonal problems, including loneliness, conflictual relationships, and fear of abandonment. \n\nMitchell et al. [ ] reviewed 25 studies (  N  \u2009=\u20091279) exploring differences in facial emotion processing between patients with BPD and healthy controls (HC). They found conclusive evidence of a tendency in patients to interpret ambiguous and neutral expressions as negative expressions. However, the findings for negative and positive expressions have been divergent. Whereas some studies found impaired accuracy in recognizing a wide range of negative expressions [ ], others found impairment only for specific expressions such as fear or disgust [ \u2013 ] or no impairment at all [ ,  ]. Furthermore, no recognition difficulties were found in full-intensity happy expressions [ ]. Patients were more accurate in recognizing happy faces than angry, sad, and neutral faces and displayed even greater accuracy than HC [ ,  ]. \n\nProcessing emotional expressions requires diverse psychological effort driven by multiple neural structures [ ]. Fusar-Poli et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis on 105 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies exploring the neural correlates of human facial expression processing in healthy respondents (  N  \u2009=\u20091600). They found increased activation of various visual areas (fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle occipital gyri), limbic areas (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus), temporal areas (middle and superior temporal gyrus), temporoparietal areas (parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, insula), prefrontal areas (medial frontal gyrus), and in the putamen and cerebellum. Although the specific interactions between these areas have not been clarified, it is hypothesized that the initial perceptual processing of faces occurs in the occipital and temporal lobes, which construct detailed representations from facial features. Subsequently, a set of brain areas, including the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, links the perceptual representation of the face to the meaning of the signaled emotion [ ]. The amygdala is a crucial brain area associated with BPD symptoms, and studies often report its hyperactivity during emotional processing in patients [ ]. Its activity may also be altered during the processing of facial expressions. \n\nRecently, there has been an increase in fMRI studies exploring brain activity differences in patients with BPD. The review by Mitchell et al. [ ] also described the differences in neural activation during facial processing between HC and patients with BPD. Heightened activity of the left and right amygdala in patients during the presentation of facial stimuli was found across studies. Specifically, patients with BPD exhibited increased amygdala activity in response to neutral stimuli and heightened amygdala activity in response to fear. A later study by Wrege et al. [ ] presented images of faces with neutral and moderately fearful expressions (50%) or intensively (100%) fearful expressions to 39 patients with BPD and 25 HC. Besides higher amygdala activation, the results revealed higher activations when viewing neutral faces (neutral faces > fixation cross) in the right temporal pole, hippocampus, pallidum, and orbitofrontal cortex in the patients with BPD as compared with the HC. There were no group differences in whole-brain activation when viewing fearful facial expressions of both intensities (moderately fearful faces > fixation cross; intensively fearful faces > fixation cross). However, the region of interest (ROI) analysis (intensively fearful > neutral; moderately fearful > neutral faces) focused on the amygdala and hippocampus revealed higher bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus activity in response to moderately fearful expressions in patients with BPD as compared with HC. Lamers et al. [ ] showed patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200920) and HC respondents only fearful faces stimuli. During this task, the patients with BPD showed hyperactivation of the frontostriatal, posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior parietal brain areas compared to HC (negative > neutral faces). ROI analysis also suggested higher activation in the emotion regulation network (amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex; ACC, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in the patients with BPD (negative > neutral faces) when compared to HC. \n\nAs for other negative emotions, Donegan et al. [ ] presented patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200915) and HC with sad facial expressions. They found heightened left amygdala activity in response to sadness (sad faces > fixation point) in patients with BPD as compared with HC. Another study by Minzenberg et al. [ ] used angry expressions in a sample of patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200912) and HC. In comparison to HC, the patients exhibited less activity in the bilateral amygdala, but more activity in the bilateral rostral ACC in response to angry expressions (anger > neutral faces). Baskin-Sommers et al. [ ] also presented respondents (N \u2009=\u200913) with angry expressions. In this study, patients with BPD demonstrated higher activity in response to anger in the left superior frontal gyrus (angry > neutral faces) relative to HC. \n\nNo unusual amygdala activity or typical patterns in brain activation were found regarding the processing of happy expressions in fMRI studies. Baskin-Sommers et al. [ ] (N \u2009=\u200913) found increased activity of the left inferior and decreased activity of the left superior frontal brain areas (happy > neutral faces); a more recent study by Lamers et al. [ ] (N \u2009=\u200922) did not replicate these findings. Besides the activity of temporal, limbic, and occipital areas in both groups, hyperactivation of the bilateral caudate was observed in the patients with BPD (happy > neutral faces). \n\nWith respect to the heterogeneous results of fMRI studies in this area, other methods might be useful to identify differences in facial processing between patients with BPD and healthy people. There has been increasing interest in heart rate variability (HRV) as a physiological marker of emotional stability and flexibility. HRV is the inconsistency of time intervals between individual heartbeats resulting from the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system [ ]. Alteration of HRV emerges from the loss of balance between these branches and the constant need of the heart to adapt to changing circumstances. High HRV is associated with better adaptation to environmental stressors and emotional stimuli, whereas low HRV is associated with emotional dysregulation and worse ability to control mental and behavioral impulses [ ,  ]. \n\nFluctuations of HRV (as an index of cerebral autonomic regulation) are associated with functional changes between and within brain regions included in the central autonomic network (CAN; prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, periaqueductal gray, pons, and medulla) [ \u2013 ]. Although imaging studies have pointed out that changes in the neural activity of the amygdala, claustrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus contribute to HRV [ ,  ,  ], less is known about their relationship during emotion regulation and specifically facial emotion processing. Steinfurth et al. [ ] explored the relationship between habitual resting state vmHRV and neural activity during explicit emotion regulation in healthy controls (  N  \u2009=\u200924). The results showed an association between vmHRV and the activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala during emotion regulation of unpleasant emotions. The group with high vmHRV displayed modulated activation of the right amygdala during the reappraisal strategy, and the group with low vmHRV displayed modulated activation of the right amygdala only when using the response modulation strategy. Similarly, respondents with high vmHRV displayed increased activation of the right PFC when regulating unpleasant emotion with reappraisal, whereas low vmHRV respondents displayed the same activation of PFC when using response modulation. Based on these results, the author suggested that different levels of vmHRV are associated with different patterns of brain activity during emotion regulation. A later study by Miller et al. [ ] assessed neural activity and resting HRV while observing and imitating emotional faces in healthy respondents (  N  \u2009=\u200941). They found negative correlation between resting HRV and activation in the mirror neuron system, insula, and amygdala during observation, but not the imitation of emotional faces. Thus, the results supported the idea, that resting HRV is linked to neural sensitivity to other\u2019s emotional cues, such as facial expressions. \n\nOnly a few studies have explored the alteration of HRV in patients with BPD. Koenig et al. [ ] performed a meta-analysis on five studies (  N  \u2009=\u2009200) focused on vagally-mediated HRV (vmHRV) in patients with BPD and HC. Results revealed lower vmHRV in patients with BPD relative to HC in resting state. Later studies found a significant relation between reduced HRV and greater BPD symptom severity together with worsened psychosocial functioning and higher emotional dysregulation, negative affective state, and depressive symptomatology [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, differences associated with emotional dysregulation between patients with BPD and HC may be apparent in HRV. \n\nTo our knowledge, there has not yet been a study reporting HRV in patients with BPD during facial emotion processing. However, Mai\u00df et al. [ ] explored HRV during the approach-avoidance task (AAT) in 42 patients with BPD. In this task, respondents are presented with happy and angry expressions and must pull or push these pictures according to their reaction. The results indicated a relationship between low HRV and an attenuated approach to angry faces with an averted gaze, suggesting that patients have a tendency to avoid this facial expression. \n\nTo summarize, patients with BPD are consistently reported to show deficits in processing neutral or ambiguous facial expressions, which they tend to interpret as negative. This bias is usually accompanied by higher amygdala activity in fMRI studies. However, the findings of fMRI studies regarding facial processing of other emotional valence have been inconsistent. Some studies found heightened left amygdala activity in patients with BPD in response to sad expressions [ ]; others found lowered bilateral amygdala activity and heightened activity of the bilateral rostral ACC or left superior frontal gyrus in response to angry expressions [ ,  ]. In this study, we explored fMRI and HRV correlates of processing facial expressions with negative valence since patients often experience difficulties in negative social situations. For this purpose, we used the \u201cfaces\u201d task [ ]. All respondents were presented with negative facial expressions (disgust, sadness, and fear) and with scrambled pictures as a control condition during fMRI with simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) measurement. We did not use neutral expressions as a control condition because there is evidence of altered neural activation while viewing neutral faces in patients with BPD as compared to HC; this could diminish the activation differences associated with negative facial stimuli [ ]. We used self-report questionnaires to assess fundamental symptoms of BPD (emotional dysregulation, rejection sensitivity, dissociation, and childhood trauma) that might affect emotional experiences during face processing in patients with BPD. We hypothesized that there are differences in neural activity between patients with BPD and HC while processing negative faces as compared to during a control condition. Based on previous studies, we specifically expected higher amygdala activity in the patients with BPD. We presumed that patients with BPD exhibit lower HRV than HC while viewing negative faces based on the previously found relationship of low HRV with emotional dysregulation. Lastly, in accordance with our previous suggestions, we expected higher amygdala activity to be associated with lower HRV during the processing of facial expressions in BPD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was part of more extensive research exploring the neural mechanisms of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) in patients with BPD. The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Boards of the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, and University Hospital Brno. \n\nThe current study was conducted before DBT treatment. We included 30 patients with BPD (29 females) and 30 matched HC (29 females). Patients with BPD were recruited from outpatient treatment at the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Brno. Inclusion criteria were: 1) at least five out of the nine DSM-V criteria for BPD and 2) one or more suicide attempts and\/or non-suicidal self-injury episodes in the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria were psychotic disorder, severe neurological disorder, or any contraindication to fMRI scanning. HC were recruited via social media advertisements. They were matched with patients in age (same age +\/\u2212 2 years), gender, and education (same level +\/\u2212 one level). Educational levels were primary school, lower secondary, higher secondary, and university. Healthy controls had no current or lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. \n\nMost patients (90%) also met the criteria for other psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) (50%), social anxiety disorder (33.3%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (23.3%), substance use disorder (alcohol\u2009=\u200936.7%; drugs\u2009=\u200916.7%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (13.3%), and panic disorder (13.3%). We also included medicated patients (83.3%). All participants were instructed not to take any sedative medication 24\u2009hours before the fMRI session. They were allowed to take their other prescribed medication, consisting mainly of antidepressants and antipsychotics. \n\nSince medication may alter neural activity [ ,  ] we made a medication index to assess the possible effects of patient medication on neural activity. The medication index was made as an ordinary scale of medication according to Barte\u010dk\u016f et al. [ ]: 0\u2009=\u2009no medication, 1\u2009=\u2009one or more drugs at lower than the therapeutic dose, 2\u2009=\u2009one drug at the therapeutic dose, 3\u2009=\u2009more drugs with one at the therapeutic dose, 4\u2009=\u2009more drugs at the therapeutic dose. Since major depressive disorder is one of the most common conditions that occur alongside BPD [ ] and most prescribed medication in BPD patients includes antidepressants and antipsychotics [ ,  ], we chose therapeutic doses of these two types of medication recommended for major depressive disorder. Therapeutic doses of antidepressants were specified according to the Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (ATRQ; [ ]). Therapeutic doses of antipsychotics were determined according to Wang et al. [ ]. The medication index was then used as a covariate in statistical analyses. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAll of the participants were informed about the study before the assessments and gave their written informed consent. On the first day, participants attended a semi-structured interview with a trained psychiatrist and completed self-report questionnaires on BPD symptoms. The next day, they performed three tasks during fMRI, starting with the \u201cfaces\u201d task. Then participants underwent the Neurofeedback task (assessing the emotion regulation ability) and the Cyberball task (assessing rejection sensitivity). The whole assessment took about two and a half hours. This study presents the fMRI data from the \u201cfaces\u201d task and its relation to the self-report questionnaires. Results from the Cyberball task in the same sample were published in L\u00e1talov\u00e1 et al. [ ] study. \n\n\n### Measurements \n  \nThe BPD diagnosis was assessed by a trained clinician using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V Personality Disorders [ ]. \n\nSelf-report questionnaires were used to assess the severity of BPD symptoms (Borderline Symptom List; BSL-23 [ ]; Czech version: [ ], emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form; DERS-SF [ ]; Czech version: [ ], rejection sensitivity (Rejection Sensitivity RS-Adult questionnaire; A-RSQ [ ], and dissociation (Multiscale Dissociation Inventory; MDI [ ]. We also assessed childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire CTQ [ ]; Czech version: [ ]). Since there is no validated Czech version of the A-RSQ and MDI questionnaires, we translated these questionnaires using the back-translation method. \n\n\n### Experimental task \n  \nWe used the exact version of the \u201cfaces\u201d task according to Paret et al. [ ]. Participants viewed pictures of faces (12 actors and 12 actresses) with emotional expressions of disgust, sadness, and fear (negative condition; NgC) from the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures ( ), and the same pictures in a scrambled version (neutral condition; NC). In all, 72 emotional faces and 72 scrambled faces were used. The pictures were presented in 24 blocks (12 NgC and 12 NC), with the order pseudorandomized with maximally two identical conditions following each other. Every block consisted of a sequence of six faces, each presented for 3 seconds. Within each block, faces with different emotional expressions of different people occurred randomly. The inter-block interval included a fixation cross on a black background, lasting randomly between nine and 11 seconds. To maintain attention, we instructed respondents to press the left or right button according to the gender of the presented face (NgC) or the color of the frame around the picture (NC). \n\n\n### Functional and structural MRI acquisition and ECG \n  \nThe acquisition was performed on the Siemens Prisma 3\u2009T MR whole-body scanner with 64-channel head-neck coil. A high-resolution structural T1 image was scanned for each participant. This makes it possible to localize the active brain areas more accurately than using functional images only. Parameters of the MPRAGE sequence were 240 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.34\u2009ms, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm). Functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) MR data were acquired in a single scanning session with a T2*-weighted multiecho multiband echo-planar imaging (ME MB EPI) sequence of 1250 scans (60 slices, TR\u2009=\u20091000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200914, 34.63 and 55.26\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009200\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u200950\u00b0, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm, MB factor\u2009=\u20095). TE values were chosen according to recommendations for ME EPI [ ], where the second echo was very close to the typical value of single echo acquisition. Simultaneously with the fMRI data, ECG and respiration were measured by Brain Products BrainAmp ExG MR system with 5\u2009kHz sampling frequency. Both signals were corrected for MR gradient artifacts [ ] in Brain Vision Analyzer 2 and then used for RETROICOR correction of fMRI data. Processed ECG signal was also used for HRV calculation. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Self-reported data \n  \nSelf-reported data were analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistic (Version 27) [ ]. Independent t-tests were performed to explore group differences in age and in self-report questionnaires. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences in the level of education between patients and HC. \n\n\n#### fMRI data pre-processing \n  \nAll scans were realigned first. The process was applied to middle echo scans when each middle echo scan was aligned to the first middle echo scan. Estimated translations and rotations were used in the realignment procedure of other echoes. RETROICOR technique [ ] suppressed any physiological noise originated in ECG and respiration in all scans. Information from all three echoes was used to create a composite scan using the contrast-to-noise weighted average. In each voxel, temporal SNR (tSNR) values were computed for each echo. The resulting voxel value was given by the weighted average of the three original tSNR-weighted values and echoes [ ,  ]. Composite functional scans were then coregistered to high resolution structural T1-weighted images and all data were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. As a last step, the spatial smoothing of functional data was calculated by Gaussian filter with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 5\u2009mm. \n\nThe data quality was checked for the presence of spatial abnormalities in Mask Explorer [ ] and for the presence of excessive movement in the movement_info tool ( ). The movement in the data was controlled by a framewise displacement (FD) measure [ ]. Data from all participants were eligible using the thresholds of 20% of scans exceeding FD\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm and 1% of scans exceeding FD\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm [ ]. \n\n\n#### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe data were processed with SPM12 toolbox ( ) running under MATLAB R2021a [ ]. General linear modelling (GLM) was used to analyze the pre-processed data. \n\nAt first, the difference between NgC and NC condition and the comparison between BPD and HC group were examined. GLM was performed on the subject level, where the design matrix contained three time courses of visual stimuli timings convolved with canonical hemodynamic function and six confound regressors for movement (translations and rotations from realignment pre-processing procedure). The task was modelled as a block design, where three time courses represent the NgC blocks, the NC blocks, and the inter-block interval. First-level contrasts correspond to NgC and NC and their difference. \n\nIn the next step, group level GLM analysis was performed. We used a two-sample t-test to find the differences between patients with BPD and HC. Group results were evaluated at the cluster level inference with an initial cut-off of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and cluster size larger than 20 and   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with FWE correction on the cluster level. For the evaluation of the NgC and NC difference across all measured subjects one-sample t-test was used. The Xjview 10.0 toolbox was used to display results [ ]. \n\nTo assess the effect in the region of interest (ROI) only, the pipeline was the same as for the whole brain analysis. The amygdala region was selected based on masks created from automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. The ROI representative was extracted as a mean of voxels assigned to the ROI. The extraction was performed on contrast estimates (NgC \u2013 NC). The medication effect was first shown using the medication index as a covariate in the group level GLM analyses. Then, statistical comparison between contrast estimates with and without medication was computed by paired t-test. For the analysis of amygdala habituation, the task regressors in the subject level GLM model were modulated by linear function, which characterizes the linear change of the effect over time. In the SPM model, the specifications of the first order time modulation were selected for task regressors. Time modulation of regressors allows for the characterization of nonstationary responses, e.g., habituation. We modeled linear effect\/linear change of heights in regressors over time. This approach was used, for example, in Peters et al. [ ]. The advantage lies in using all scans in one model, which provides a better signal-to-noise input into the model than comparing the average BOLD signal from 18\u2009seconds of first and last blocks. Random order of the blocks (with max 2 repetitions consequently) also didn\u2019t allow to split each subject data into two parts of the same length. \n\nCorrelation analyses were conducted to examine associations between amygdala activity, specifically, HRV, and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n#### Heart rate variability \n  \nECG data were preprocessed in the BrainVision Analyzer 2 [ ]. MR gradient artifacts were suppressed by a subtraction approach [ ]. The data were resampled to a 250\u2009Hz sampling rate and filtered with the Butterworth zero phase low pass filter with a cut-off at 40\u2009Hz. Then, R waves were detected by a template matching procedure and manually checked with a visual inspection. \n\nThe standard deviation of heart rate values was computed in the NgC blocks as the heart rate variability (HRV) parameter. The comparison between the patients with BPD and HC groups were calculated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test in MATLAB R2021a. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine associations between HRV and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results of the independent t-test showed no significant differences between BPD and HC groups in age. Significant between-group differences were found in BSL-23, A-RSQ, DERS-SF, MDI, and CTQ scores. In all questionnaires, patients with BPD had significantly higher scores than HC. A Mann-Whitney U test suggested a significant difference in education. Details are presented in Table  . Since there was a significant difference in educational level between groups, the possible effect of education on self-report questionnaires was explored by ANCOVA (using education as a covariate). Results showed no effect of education on differences between the groups in any of the self-report questionnaires.\n   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample \n  \n BPD   borderline personality disorder,   HC   healthy control,   M   mean,   SD   standard deviation,   BSL-23   Borderline Symptom List,   A-RSQ   Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire,   DERS-SF   Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form,   MDI   Multiscale Dissociation Inventory,   CTQ   Childhood Trauma Questionnaire \n  \n\n### fMRI results \n  \nThe between-group comparison did not show any significant whole-brain differences between patients with BPD and HC in the NgC contrasted to the NC. Further, we performed a region of interest (ROI) analysis focused on the differences between groups specifically in the amygdala. The ROI analysis revealed no significant differences between patients and controls in amygdala activation. \n\nAs we identified no differences in fMRI between the groups, we compared the task conditions on the whole sample. The cluster-level whole-brain analysis identified eight large clusters in the NgC contrasted to NC condition (contrast NgC minus NC). Clusters had activation peaks in the cerebellum posterior lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, medial frontal gyrus, putamen, superior and frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus (Fig.  ). A detailed description of clusters is provided in Table  .   \nActivation map showing areas with higher activation during negative facial processing in all subjects (patients with BPD and HC\u00a0together).

Results showed no significant differences. \n\n\n### Additional analyses \n  \n#### Medication effect \n  \nThe results showed no significant differences between contrast estimates (NgC minus NC) with and without medication (Fig.  ).   \nResults of the comparison of contrast estimates (NgC minus NC) with and without medication \n  \n\n\n#### Amygdala habituation \n  \nSome authors have suggested that it might not be that the average amygdala activity is impaired in patients with BPD during emotional stimuli, but rather that patients with BPD show lower habituation on emotional stimuli as compared with HC [ ,  ]. Since we did not find differences in amygdala activity between the groups, we also explored differences in amygdala habituation. The group comparison results did not show differences in amygdala habituation between the patients with BPD and HC (t\u2009=\u20094.55; p \u2009=\u2009.47). \n\n\n\n### Heart rate variability results \n  \nThe results showed significantly lower HRV in patients with BPD than in HC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.004;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) in NgC condition, as illustrated in Fig.  . HRV was significantly lower in patients also in NC condition (  p  \u2009=\u2009.003,   r  \u2009=\u2009.35). No differences were found within-groups in NgC versus NC condition (BPD group:   p  \u2009=\u2009.70;   r  \u2009=\u2009.007; HC group:   p  \u2009=\u2009.52;   r  \u2009=\u2009.03). \n\n  \nDifferences between patients with BPD and HC during the NgC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.004;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) and NC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.003;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) condition \n  \n\n\n### Correlation analyses \n  \n#### Amygdala activity and HRV \n  \nNo significant correlations were found between the left amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.12,   p  \u2009=\u2009.53) and the right amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.11,   p  \u2009=\u2009.56) in BPD patients. No significant correlations were found between the left amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.01,   p  \u2009=\u2009.95) and the right amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.09,   p  \u2009=\u2009.65) in healthy controls. \n\n\n#### Amygdala activity and self-report questionnaires \n  \nSince no differences were found in amygdala activity between groups, correlations were performed on the whole sample. No significant correlations were found between the left amygdala activity and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.08;   p  \u2009=\u2009.54), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.07;   p  \u2009=\u2009.58), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.07;   p  \u2009=\u2009.55), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .03;   p  \u2009=\u2009.79), or CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .06;   p  \u2009=\u2009.61) scores. No significant correlations were found between the right amygdala activity and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.20;   p  \u2009=\u2009.11), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .02;   p  \u2009=\u2009.87), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.13;   p  \u2009=\u2009.31), or DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.13;   p  \u2009=\u2009.32) scores. \n\n\n#### Heart rate variability and self-report questionnaires \n  \nNo significant correlations were found between HRV and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.15;   p  \u2009=\u2009.43), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.15;   p  \u2009=\u2009.43), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.19;   p  \u2009=\u2009.31), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009.33;   p  \u2009=\u2009.09), and CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.04;   p  \u2009=\u2009.81) scores in patients with BPD. As well in HC, no significant correlations were found between HRV and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.00;   p  \u2009=\u2009.99), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.08;   p  \u2009=\u2009.67), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009.24;   p  \u2009=\u2009.22), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.04;   p  \u2009=\u2009.83), or CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.17;   p  \u2009=\u2009.38). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study explored fMRI and HRV correlates of negative emotional facial processing in patients with BPD and HC. We found large scale activation across the brain in the whole sample while processing negative facial expressions as compared to the control condition (scrambled pictures). Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no significant differences between patients with BPD and HC in neural activity nor higher amygdala activity specifically in patients with BPD as compared with HC when processing negative facial expressions as compared to the control condition. Moreover, amygdala activity was unrelated to BPD symptom severity. The results suggest no abnormal BOLD activity during negative emotional facial processing in patients with BPD. Further, patients with BPD displayed lower HRV as compared with HC, regardless of condition type. However, there was no significant association between HRV and BPD symptoms, rejection to sensitivity, dissociation, emotional dysregulation, and childhood trauma as measured by self-report questionnaires both in patients with BPD and HC. These findings indicate that low HRV may be associated with BPD, but it was unrelated to experimental condition and symptoms assessed in this study. \n\nIn the whole sample, we found heightened activity in the cerebellum posterior lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, medial frontal gyrus, putamen, superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus. Activity in the superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, and medial frontal gyrus was also found in previous studies exploring brain activity during facial processing in HC and patients with BPD [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Thus, the \u201cfaces\u201d task seems a valid method for eliciting the activity of areas connected to facial emotion processing. However, differences between patients with BPD and HC were not detected by the \u201cfaces\u201d task in this study, although the differences in self-reported BPD symptoms between the groups were very high. \n\nSeveral factors may explain the discrepancy between our findings and previous findings regarding brain activity and mainly amygdala activity during facial processing in patients with BPD. Previous studies found amygdala hyperactivity in patients while viewing neutral and fearful expressions [ ,  ,  ]. In the current study, we presented respondents with mixed expressions of fear, disgust, and sadness. Wrege et al. [ ] pointed out that the neural substrates of emotion processing seem to be task-dependent and affected by the type of comparison. Thus, it is possible that combining negative expressions of different emotions might have diminished amygdala hyperactivity or brain differences between groups in general. Moreover, there seem to be fMRI correlates during facial expression experiencing other than the amygdala. For example, studies found heightened activity of the superior frontal gyrus [ ,  ,  ], medial frontal gyrus [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ], and precuneus [ ,  ,  ]. Other studies did not find heightened amygdala activity [ ,  ]. It is possible that amygdala activity is heightened primarily in processing neutral or fearful expressions; therefore, various emotional valences should be explored separately. Moreover, altered brain activity to neutral faces in BPD is a stable finding [ ,  ]; using neutral faces as a control condition for comparing to negative faces might be therefore biased. It follows that the relationship between higher amygdala activity and processing negative facial expressions is not straightforward. \n\nAccording to some studies [ ,  ], differences between patients with BPD and HC in emotion processing are not connected to amygdala hyperactivity but rather to slower amygdala habituation in patients. Following this hypothesis, we also analyzed differences in amygdala habituation to investigate the possibility of this effect. However, we did not find significant differences in habituation, thus we can rule out this process in our study and support previous ideas. \n\nStudies by Frick et al. [ ] and Mier et al. [ ] that identified amygdala hyperactivity in patients with BPD during neutral and negative expressions used tasks in which the respondents were instructed to identify the presented facial emotion. Following the procedure from Paret et al. [ ], respondents in our task were instructed to identify gender on the facial pictures to maintain their attention while viewing the faces. It is possible that neural correlates identified in previous studies might have reflected the emotion recognition process, not only the emotional experience while viewing faces. However, further research is needed to explore how ways of maintaining attention may affect these tasks. We may speculate that passive viewing of emotional expression is insufficient to detect abnormalities in brain processing of emotional faces in patients with BPD, even though Donegan et al. [ ] found heightened amygdala activity even in this type of task. It is also possible that identifying gender on the face pictures might have diminished the power to detect differences between the groups. \n\nAnother possible influence in our study is patient medication. According to Schulze, Schmahl and Niedtfeld [ ], medication considerably influences neural activations of the left amygdala and hippocampus. In their study, medication-free patients displayed hyperresponsivity to negative stimuli compared to HC. However, no hyperresponsivity was found in patients with BPD currently taking various psychotropic medication. This suggestion was supported by a later study by Paret et al. [ ], in which a single dose of citalopram reduced bilateral amygdala activity while viewing negative affective expressions in the same task that was used in the current study. Since we included mostly medicated patients (83.3%) in our study, we analyzed the possible effect of medication. However, we did not find significant differences in neural activity with and without medication. Thus, we can rule out the effect of the medication on neural activity in this study. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the effect of the medication completely since we had one group with various kinds of medications and the second group without any medication. \n\nThis study\u2019s second focus was examining HRV differences during facial emotion processing. Compared to HC, patients exhibited lower HRV when viewing both negative expressions and scrambled pictures. This finding suggests that patients generally have a lower HRV compared to HC. However, we did not find a significant relationship between HRV and amygdala activity in the patient group. The absence of this relationship might be explained by no differences in amygdala activity between patients and healthy controls. Also, there was no relationship between HRV and BPD symptom severity, rejection sensitivity, dissociation, emotional dysregulation, or childhood trauma. This result contrasts with previous studies [ \u2013 ,  ,  ]. A possible explanation may lie in methodological differences. The studies that found a positive relationship between HRV and BPD measured HRV outside the fMRI, whereas we measured HRV in fMRI. Although we did not clarify the association between lower HRV and BPD symptoms, low HRV seems to be connected to a worsened ability to react to emotional stimuli [ \u2013 ] and it might underlie disturbed emotion processing in BPD. A possible explanation for why group differences were found in HRV and not in fMRI may lie in the RETROICOR preprocessing technique. This routinely used technique suppresses the variability associated with physiological noise in the context of fMRI data, including the heart pulsation. On the basis of the timing of R-waves in the ECG, basic functions are regressed from fMRI, which suppresses undesired physiological artifacts and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio [ ,  ]. In our case, a partial suppression of the desired effect might occur. In general, it seems appropriate to assess emotional dysregulation by various markers, including both fMRI and psychophysiological functions. According to our expectations, BPD patients have lower HRV in general. Although we still do not know what processes underlie lower HRV in patients, it was not task dependent in our study. \n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be discussed. As mentioned, we used the \u201cfaces\u201d task with a combination of negative expressions instead of focusing on one specific emotion. Presenting more than one emotion and quickly changing among several expressions may affect neural activity and diminish potential differences. Although this may be understood as a limitation, this \u201cfaces\u201d task design is diverse and complex, thus resembling social interactions in everyday life. \n\nBecause of our sample composition, we cannot generalize results to men. We also did not exclude patients with BPD with comorbid disorders. Therefore, we cannot reject the possibility that the absence of diversity in neural activity and lower HRV are associated with patient comorbidities. However, comorbid disorders are natural in patients with BPD. Moreover, most of our BPD patients were medicated, thus we cannot rule out the medication influence completely, and further studies could include a direct comparison of medicated and unmedicated patients. \n\nPrevious studies and reviews [ ,  ,  ] provided evidence about abnormal amygdala activity of patients with BPD during facial emotion processing. However, we did not find any differences in brain activity. The relationship between BPD symptoms and the amygdala seems more complex, and more research is needed. Future research should explore neural activity connected to specific emotional valence rather than multiple emotions. It is also necessary to clarify the role of medication in changing neural activity and comorbidity in HRV abnormality. Although low HRV seems connected to emotional instability and worsened ability to react to emotional stimuli [ \u2013 ], more studies are needed to better understand its relationship. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study exploring brain activity together with heart rate variability and their relationship during facial emotion processing in BPD patients. We did not find any differences between patients and healthy controls in brain activity, neither in amygdala, specifically. Further, there were no difference in amygdala habituation during the task between the groups. Although heightened amygdala activity is a frequently reported result, it seems that its connection to facial emotion processing is not straightforward, and future studies should explore its activity during specific emotional valence rather than multiple emotions. The results showed lower HRV in patients with BPD than in healthy controls, but HRV was not associated with BPD symptoms. Therefore, low HRV seems to be connected to the emotion dysregulation disorder, however its relationship to specific symptoms or functions needs to be clarified. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10870473,"text_md5":"c71e41b05ccad053eaff70ee8e7e36fb","field_positions":{"authors":[0,153],"journal":[154,194],"publication_year":[196,200],"title":[211,342],"keywords":[356,481],"abstract":[494,2692],"body":[2701,44874]},"batch":1,"pmid":38360712,"doi":"10.1186\/s40479-024-00245-4","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10870473","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10870473"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10870473\">10870473<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10870473  Facial emotion processing in patients with borderline personality disorder as compared with healthy controls: an fMRI and ECG study"}

This paper reports on a neuroimaging-based study designed to investigate the responsivity and attribution of the index at different levels of anticipatory anxiety and pain perception. The index was measured in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment that randomly combined three visual anticipation cues and painful stimuli of two intensities. The peripheral and cerebral responses to pain anticipation and perception were quantified to corroborate bodily responsivity, and their temporal correlation was also assessed to identify the response attribution of the index. Contrasting with the high responsivity across levels of pain sensation, a low responsivity of the index across levels of anticipatory anxiety revealed its specificity across pain experiences. Discrepancies between the effects of perception and anticipation were validated across regions and levels of brain activity, providing a brain basis for peripheral response specificity. The index was also characterized by a 1-s lag in both anticipation and perception of pain, implying top-down innervation of the periphery. Our findings suggest that the SNS responds to pain in an emotion-specific and sensation-unbiased manner, thus enabling an early assessment of individual pain perception using this index. This study integrates peripheral and cerebral hemodynamic responses toward a comprehensive understanding of bodily responses to pain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPain is commonly defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual and potential tissue damage . The experience of pain leads to the onset of perceptual changes that may begin with early anticipation of pain by integrating contextual information, prompting the body to avoid underlying pain based on previous experience . Pain perception can activate the body\u2019s responses in motor and autonomic dimensions to prepare for and minimize potential injury with the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response . Both the central and peripheral nervous systems respond to pain, with the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in particular functioning to modulate the cardiovascular system to transport the energy resources needed for perception and motor responses . Whereas the anticipation of pain is considered an emotional and cognitive attribute of the pain experience, its high correlation with pain modulation, individual differences in pain sensitivity, and even the development of chronic pain syndromes urges us to accurately detect and assess its neural activation status for early medical intervention . Physiologically, the anticipation of pain retrieves past pain perceptions from memory and evokes fear and\/or anxiety due to possible threats to bodily integrity. Moreover, depending on their duration and level, these evoked emotions could recruit cortical activation and descending activation of the SNS to modulate pain perception and behavior . Therefore, these clarified mechanisms provide rich evidence for assessing pain perception and its early anticipation in human neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies.   \nOverview of the method for validating the responsivity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index and brain activity to early anticipation of pain. The method comprises three parts: Measurements and stimuli, data processing, and co-varying analyses.   I  : stimulus current intensity;   t  : time;  : systolic blood pressure;  : diastolic blood pressure; BP: blood pressure; MBP: mean blood pressure;  : peripheral arterial stiffness index;  : pre-processed index; GLM: general linear model. \n  \n\nThe mediating role of the SNS facilitates the noninvasive assessment of anticipatory responses to pain through peripheral measurements . Given the integral role of vasomotion in the hemodynamic consequences of sympathetic activation, our research group proposed a noninvasive method to estimate sympathetic modulation of vascular tone using a sympathetic vasomotion assessment index, termed the peripheral arterial stiffness index, which is the inverse of the vascular conductance in the cutaneous vasculature . Sympathetic innervation of peripheral arteries normally constricts vascular smooth muscles and stiffens the arterial wall, resulting in a functional elevation in the stiffness of peripheral arteries. Consequently, these functional changes under sympathetic innervation can be quantified to assess the body\u2019s responses to exogenous and endogenous stimuli . Our proposed method approximates a nonlinear dynamic relationship between arterial radius and arterial pressure, practically deriving the index through simultaneous measurement of a finger photoplethysmogram (PPG) and continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP). This index has been shown effective in quantitatively assessing subjective pain sensation . In addition, a neuroimaging-based study provided evidence that the responsivity of this index following a painful stimulus was positively correlated with the level of brain activity associated with pain perception . However, the experience of pain is subjectively different from the fear and anxiety evoked by pain anticipation . Moreover, sympathetic responses in peripheral organs discard the impact of pain on the body in emotional and cognitive dimensions, thus providing only unbiased evidence of human responsivity to stimuli . Therefore, it can be challenging to accurately assess the emotional and cognitive aspects of the body\u2019s anticipatory responses to pain by relying solely on the peripheral arterial stiffness index. \n\nUpon reviewing the clarified mechanisms, the cerebral underpinnings of pain perception and its anticipation have been delineated to identify and dissociate these two processes based on functional neuroimaging methods . Among these, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can noninvasively measure and localize brain activity using the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal to detect hemodynamic responses caused by central activation . Utilizing this technique, activated brain regions and their functional connectivity related to pain perception were revealed at the individual level, rendered in the form of a pain matrix mainly comprising anterior cingulate (ACC), insular (INS), prefrontal (PFC), and somatosensory cortices, the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum (Cb), and amygdala . Brain regions activated during pain anticipation, although distinct, are closely related to those involved in pain perception, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), ACC, PFC, INS, medial frontal lobe, and Cb . Further, fMRI also revealed that the level of brain activation associated with pain intensity fluctuates depending on the anticipatory intensity of the pain . An fMRI biomarker, based on whole-brain functional connectivity, was proposed to characterize pain-related brain activity and predict the intensity of sustained pain in experimental and clinical settings . In addition, empathy for pain, a physically painless but psychologically anticipated pain process, is mediated by the cognitive and emotional attributes of the pain matrix rather than its sensory attribute, as evidenced by fMRI analyses . On the other hand, the combination of neurophysiological and neuroimaging analyses could give rise to converging evidence and provide a more valid basis for developing assessment methods for pain perception and its anticipation. Consequently, central hemodynamic responses depicted by fMRI brain activity should be introduced to enhance our understanding and accurate assessment of bodily responses in anticipation of pain. This would yield neuroimaging-based evidence for corresponding peripheral hemodynamic responses quantified by the peripheral arterial stiffness index. \n\nThis paper aims to assess the innervation role of the SNS during pain anticipation by investigating the responsivity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index and its neuroimaging-based evidence. An experiment incorporating anticipation cues and painful stimuli of different intensities was designed to examine and compare peripheral and central hemodynamic responses measured by the index and fMRI time series, respectively. In addition, temporal lags between the two responses were calculated to infer the temporal correlation in a body-wide response to pain perception and its anticipation. This might validate the effectiveness of the index as an early detector of pain experience and further leverage a valid theoretical basis for integrating central and peripheral hemodynamics during pain experience. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nFigure\u00a0  presents an overview of the study that uses fMRI time series to validate the responsivity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index during pain anticipation; this comprises three parts: measurements and stimuli, data processing, and co-varying analyses. The responsivity of the index and brain activity were evaluated to confirm the consequences of pain anticipation and perception. The covariation in hemodynamic responses between the brain and periphery was analyzed to identify and underpin the attribution of responses of the index to anticipation and perception. \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe measured the peripheral arterial stiffness index and fMRI time series in 22 healthy young adults (males, age: 22.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 years [mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0S.D.]), none of whom had a history of neurological, psychiatric, or chronic pain. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants before conducting the experiments, and the study was approved by the Hiroshima University Ethics Committee (Registration number: E-965-5 and E-17-2).   \nExperimental configurations. (  a  ) Experimental protocol for one of the two sessions. VAS: visual analog scale; LA: low anxiety; MA: medial anxiety; HA: high anxiety; LS: low stimulus intensity; HS: high stimulus intensity. (  b  ) A rating scale displayed on a screen facing the participants (Japanese text in the image: \u201cPlease evaluate the degree of pain during the previous stimulus.\u201d). (  c  ) The rotary dial input device for participants to report their subjective sensations. \n  \n\n\n### Experimental configurations \n  \nThe experiment includes two consecutive sessions, with the experimental protocol for one session arranged as Fig.\u00a0 a. To generate anticipatory anxiety during the experiment, a pre-testing was conducted before the experimental task. The intensity of the stimulus current was set to a value   at which the participant verbally reported the pain level as \u201c30\u201d on the visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 to generate sufficient pain and reduce interindividual differences in pain perception. Each experimental task was initiated with a 60-s rest to relieve participants, followed by the execution of a 20-s pre-rating consisting of four items (pain, anxiety, pleasantness, and unpleasantness). Each trial commenced with a 16-s rest, then an 8-s anticipation cue, an 8-s painful stimulus, and ended with a 20-s rating with the same four items. These steps were repeated randomly a total of 12 times with varying anticipation cues and stimulus intensities. The experimental task ended with a 16-s rest, with a total duration of 1020 s for each session. \n\nAll participants were studied in the supine position at a thermoneutral ambient temperature throughout the experiment. In each task, a cue was randomly presented to indicate the probable intensity of a subsequent painful stimulus. Four anticipation cues were designed to induce different levels of anxiety: low stimulus\/low anxiety (LS\/LA), low stimulus\/moderate anxiety (LS\/MA), high stimulus\/moderate anxiety (HS\/MA), and high stimulus\/high anxiety (HS\/HA). The stimulus currents of 0.5  and 1.5  the pre-tested intensity   were applied to the participants, corresponding to LS and HS, respectively. During the rest and painful stimuli periods, a \u201c  +  \u201d symbol was displayed to help participants focus and relax. The color of the \u201c  +  \u201d symbols displayed during the anticipation cues corresponded to the level of pain anticipation, where blue indicates LS\/LA, green indicates LS\/MA or HS\/MA with a 50% possibility each, and red indicates HS\/HA. In this study, the rating on subjective sensations was gathered using the VAS based on a graduated line mark, with the leftmost 0 representing \u201cno pain\u201d and the rightmost 100 representing \u201cthe worst pain imaginable\u201d as shown in Fig.\u00a0 b. Rating subjective sensations by moving over the line marker was accomplished using a rotary dial input device as shown in Fig.\u00a0 c and visualized by Processing software (Ver.3.0, open project). In subsequent analyses, z-score normalization was applied to the ratings across sessions to minimize inter- and intra-individual differences. \n\nThe painful stimulus was generated by an electrocutaneous stimulus system that comprises an isolator (SS-203J, NIHON KOHDEN Corp., Tokyo, Japan), an analog function generation (WF1973, NF Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan), an electric stimulator (SEN-8203, NIHON KOHDEN Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and a surface stimulation electrode (NM-990W, NIHON KOHDEN Corp., Tokyo, Japan). During the painful stimulus experiment, a sinusoidal electrocutaneous stimulus with a frequency of 250 Hz and a predetermined intensity was generated and applied to the participant\u2019s right forearm to evoke pain and activate the SNS. \n\n\n### Biosignal measurement and processing \n  \n#### Biosignal measurement \n  \nTo analyze the responses of the peripheral arterial stiffness index and brain activity to the early anticipation of pain, electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive ABP, and fingertip PPG were measured simultaneously in the MRI environment. A three-lead ECG signal was measured using a BIOPAC ECG100C-MRI amplifier with LEAD110 electrode leads (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). ECG was measured to provide cardiac cycle timing for deriving the index beat by beat. The PPG signal from the left index finger was measured using a BIOPAC PPG100C-MRI amplifier with a TSD200-MRI sensor (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The systolic and diastolic blood pressure data were measured at the left middle finger using an MR-compatible device (CareTaker, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). All measured biosignals were collected at 1 kHz through a BIOPAC MP 150 modular data acquisition and analysis system (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA) into a laptop computer and visualized and recorded using AcqKnowledge Data Acquisition and Analysis Software Version 4.2 (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). \n\n\n#### Peripheral arterial stiffness index \n  \nAs described above, a peripheral arterial stiffness index was proposed to quantify the sympathetic innervation of peripheral arteries by estimating the corresponding changes in arterial diameter and mechanical properties in response to a radial force exerted on the arterial wall. Given the challenge of measuring the continuous arterial blood pressure in the MRI environment, an approximate index was proposed to fulfill the MR compatibility requirements by using only systolic and diastolic blood pressure, defined as : where  ,  ,  , and   denote the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and the maximum and minimum values of PPG for each heartbeat, respectively.   represents the relative stiffness value of the arterial wall. The high correlation between the primitive and approximate indices has been verified, as has the applicability of the approximate index in the MRI environment . Therefore, the approximate index was used to assess the responses of the SNS to the anticipation of pain in this study. \n\nTaking measurement noise into account, outliers in the index   would be removed when the corresponding ABP falls outside the range of mean blood pressure ( ) \u00a0mmHg. Since the peripheral arterial stiffness index   is calculated beat-to-beat on the basis of the R-peak time of the ECG, cubic spline interpolation is performed within two adjacent R-peak times to construct a continuous curve with a frequency of 1 Hz. Moreover, a 3rd-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.15 Hz is subjected to the interpolated results, considering that the respiratory modulation of the cardiovascular system lies in the frequency range of 0.16 to 0.33 Hz and the high-frequency noise in the MRI environment . This low-frequency component is considered to be the variation in arterial stiffness, reflecting changes elicited solely by external sensory stimuli and\/or mental stress . The filtered results are then normalized by their maximum value for the rest period of each trial in the experiment to highlight the variation and reduce inter- and intra-individual differences. \n\n\n#### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll statistical tests presented in the manuscript are Brunner\u2013Munzel test with Holm adjustment (significance level: 0.01) unless otherwise noted. Cliff\u2019s delta   is presented as a measure of effect size ranging from \u20141 to +1. The absolute value of   indicates the proximity of the two groups, while the sign of   denotes whether group A is greater (+) or vice versa (\u2212). The statistical package R, version 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), was used in this study for statistical analysis. \n\n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \n#### Data acquisition \n  \nA 3-T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head coil was used for the acquisition of MRI data. T2-weighted functional data encompassing the whole brain were acquired with gradient-echo planar imaging (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mm  voxels, slice thickness: 3 mm (without gap), repetition time (TR): 1000 ms, echo time (TE): 30 ms, flip angle: 80\u00b0, field of view (FOV): 192 mm, and 42 slices). A high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) structural scan (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm  voxels, slice thickness: 1 mm, TR: 2500 ms, TE: 2.98 ms, flip angle: 9\u00b0, FOV: 192 mm, and 176 slices) was performed to normalize and represent the functional data by individuals. \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI data were analyzed using SPM12  and custom MATLAB scripts. The following preprocessing steps were applied to the fMRI data before statistical analysis. The first ten volumes scanned during dummy cycles were discarded to allow for the stabilization of the BOLD signal intensity, resulting in a total of 720 volumes being analyzed in this study. Functional images were then corrected for timing differences in slice acquisition and realigned to the first volume to correct for image intensity outliers resulting from gradient and motion-related artifacts. To further accurately identify areas of brain activation, coregistration was performed between low-resolution functional images and high-resolution structural images. Subsequently, the co-registered functional images for each participant were warped to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template to match a common anatomical space, reducing inter-individual variations in brain shape and size. Finally, the functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm to suppress noise and enhance the signal. \n\n\n#### Task analyses \n  \nThe average brain activity and its group differences in anticipation and perception of pain were estimated and tested using a standard GLM analysis to verify the stimulus consequences and further evidence the attribution of peripheral responses. The first-level GLM analysis was conducted to estimate individual voxel-level brain activations. The 12 task trials in a single session for each participant in the experiment were separately divided and temporally sequenced in series according to the four components of a single run (rest, pain anticipation, painful stimulus, and rating), and each session was analyzed individually. Accordingly, different anticipation cues or painful stimulus intensities were pooled into separate regressors in task analyses. The model also incorporated the six estimated head motion parameters (X, Y, Z, pitch, roll, yaw) as regressors of non-interest, totaling ten regressors for the analysis. To examine brain activity across anticipation cues, 12 contrast images were calculated individually: six for pain anticipation states (HA>LA, HA>MA, MA>LA, LA>HA, MA>HA, and LA>MA) and six for pain perception states (HS\/HA>HS\/MA, LS\/MA>LS\/LA, HS\/MA>LS\/MA, HS\/MA>HS\/HA, LS\/LA>LS\/MA, and LS\/MA>HS\/MA). Second-level (group) analyses were conducted on all analysis results across sessions based on the summary statistic method, testing group differences in average brain activity using one-sample   t  -tests. Significant brain region activation for all participants was accepted with an uncorrected   p  -value of   at the voxel level and a cluster-level   p  -value of   corrected using FWE (family-wise error). \n\nTo clarify the attribution of responses in the peripheral arterial stiffness index, the covariation of responses between brain activity and the index was analyzed according to the temporal correlation . Here, the normalized   time series of the 12 task trials in each session were also divided to align with the four components of a single trial and sequenced separately alongside the ten regressors described above, for a total of 14 regressors in the first-level model. Moreover, the   regressors were progressively shifted by 1 s in the range of  3 to 3 s to conduct a stepwise co-varying analysis, represented by a time lag  . As earlier, the low- and high-frequency noise was filtered out. Voxel-wise parameter estimates for each covariation were calculated at the individual level, and one-sample   t  -tests were used to identify areas of brain activation that could be covariant with the time-shifted   in the group-level analysis. The significant covariation for all participants can be accepted with an uncorrected   p  -value of   at the voxel level and a cluster-level   p  -value of   corrected using FWE.   \nSensory changes in all participants across different experimental tasks rated by VAS results and normalized by individuals. The black point range lines represent the mean and standard deviation. The statistical test results based on the Cliff\u2019s delta   effect size and the Brunner\u2013Munzel test with Holm adjustment are also shown (significance level: 0.01), and significant   p  -values (<\u00a00.01) are in red. \n  \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n  \nExamples of ratings on pain and anxiety, stimulus intensity, measured heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure  , diastolic blood pressure  , photoplethysmogram (PPG), and peripheral arterial stiffness index   from Participant A during session two, respectively. ABP: arterial blood pressure. The black dashed lines represent periods of anticipation cues without physical painful stimuli (no pain). \n  \n\nThis study aimed to elucidate the anticipatory responses of the peripheral arterial stiffness index to pain using fMRI analyses. Participants rated pain intensity, anxiety, pleasantness, and unpleasantness following a painful stimulus under each of the four anticipation cues. As expected, painful stimuli of both intensities evoked pain sensations in the population and validated the dose-response relationship between stimulus intensity and pain (Fig.\u00a0 a). Comparison of LS\/LA and LS\/MA yielded a significant difference in pain ratings ( ,  ), but not between HS\/MA and HS\/HA ( ,  ). Consistent with previous research on experimental pain anticipation, anticipation cues before painful stimuli were effective in evoking anxiety in individuals and also exhibited a steep dose-response relationship between LS\/LA and the other three levels in terms of anxiety ratings (Fig.\u00a0 b,  ,  , and  ). A comparison between LS\/MA and HS\/MA yielded a significant difference in anxiety ratings ( ,  ), but not between HS\/MA and HS\/HA ( ,  ). The opposite patterns of results were found for pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings (Fig.\u00a0 c and d), which respectively decreased and increased with increasing levels of anticipation cues in an approximately linear dose-response relationship. The pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings were significantly different across anticipation cues, except for the comparison between HS\/MA and HS\/HA in unpleasantness ratings ( ,  ).   \nNormalized   and   for all participants in the experiment.

(  a  ) At rest. (  b  ) Period of pain anticipation. (  c  ) Period of pain perception. Here, analysis results across sessions covered all anticipation cues or painful stimulus intensities. The significant activation of brain regions for all participants can be accepted with an uncorrected   p  -value of   at the voxel level and a cluster-level   p  -value of   corrected using FWE. \n  \n\nNext, peripheral hemodynamic responses during the anticipation of pain and subsequent painful stimuli were investigated based on a panoply of measured and calculated biosignals shown as examples of time-series waveforms in Fig.\u00a0 . Peripheral activation was quantified using the peripheral arterial stiffness index based on the rise in blood pressure and the decline in PPG amplitude, which may be attributed to SNS activation triggered by corresponding emotional and sensory changes. Following several successive experimental runs, sensory adaptation and refractoriness of peripheral responses in the participant were observed at the lower levels of anticipation cues during the 450\u2013600 s period. HR, a commonly used index reflecting psychological status, was also examined in this study to assess cardiac responses to emotional and sensory changes. However, no significant increase was observed across individuals or anticipation cues as shown in Fig.\u00a0 a. A slight increase in the group average of the normalized index   was found during pain anticipation, and a more pronounced increase was found during pain perception, particularly for the anticipation cues of HS\/HA and HS\/MA. To expose the responsivity of the index, the normalized   and   during the anticipation of pain and subsequent painful stimuli were respectively averaged and investigated across anticipation cues as shown in Fig.\u00a0 b\u2013e. No significant differences in   were identified across the various anticipation cues from pain anticipation to pain perception ( ,  ). Despite no significant differences in   were found among the different anticipation cues during pain anticipation (Fig.\u00a0 d), there was a significant elevation in   when comparing LS\/LA to HS\/MA and HS\/HA (Fig.\u00a0 e,  ,  ;  ,  ), but only a minor elevation between LS\/MA and HS\/MA and HS\/HA ( ,  ;  ,  ).   \nGroup analysis results for the contrasts across anticipation cues in both sessions for all participants. (  a  ) Pain anticipation. (  b  ) Pain perception. The significant activation of brain regions for all participants can be accepted with an uncorrected   p  -value of   at the voxel level and a cluster-level   p  -value of   corrected using FWE. \n  \n\nNext, a whole-brain voxel-wise GLM analysis was performed to assess the activation of brain regions associated with pain and anxiety due to emotional and sensory stimuli, thereby identifying the attribution of peripheral hemodynamic responses to the anticipation of pain and subsequent painful stimuli. Participants were calm at rest and exhibited no significant activation in the brain as shown in Fig.\u00a0 a. A set of brain regions exhibited activation during pain anticipation, including the INS, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), thalamus, ACC, medial cingulate cortex (MCC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), angular gyrus (AnG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and Cb (Fig.\u00a0 b and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). The activation during painful stimuli was also observed in a set of brain regions, including the S1, INS, ACC, DLPFC, putamen, and Cb (Fig.\u00a0 c and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). All voxel-wise results reported are significant across individuals at a   p  -value of   voxel uncorrected and a   p  -value of   cluster FWE-corrected. These activated brain regions have been previously reported to be associated with pain anticipation (INS, ACC ), pain perception (S1, ACC, INS, and prefrontal cortex ), and sympathetic activation (DLPFC ), preliminarily attributing the peripheral hemodynamic responses to the descending activation of the SNS elicited by anticipatory anxiety and pain perception. \n\nGiven the observed differences in the responsivity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index, the responsivity of brain activity across anticipation cues was subsequently investigated by contrasting each anticipation cue against another at the voxel level. For the contrast HA>LA, the AIC, putamen, Cd, S1, thalamus, SMA, and VLPFC were significantly activated. For HA>MA, significant activation was found in the AIC, thalamus, S1, and SMG, suggesting a positive association between levels of brain activity and anxiety due to differences in AIC activation . For LA>HA, the SMA and S1 were significantly activated, hinting at a modulation of pain perception and the involvement of bodily defense actions during pain anticipation . Conversely, no significant activation was found for contrasts MA>LA, MA>HA, and LA>MA, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 a. As for pain perception, significant activation was observed for the contrast HS\/HA>HS\/MA in the AnG, SPL, dPCC, M1, Cb, and visual association cortex, indicating differences in sensory input and arousing attention at levels of anxiety under the same stimulus intensity . For LS\/MA>LS\/LA, regions related to subjective pain experience, including the VLPFC, thalamus, DLPFC, Cd, and SMA, were significantly activated, suggesting a modulatory role of anxiety on pain perception. For LS\/MA>HS\/MA, the SMA, S1, DLPFC, VLPFC, ACC, and Cd were significantly activated under the same anticipation cue. This activation of brain regions linked to reassurance and pleasant emotions was likely due to the actual stimulus intensity being lower than anticipated . Furthermore, there was no significant activation for contrasts HS\/MA>LS\/MA, HS\/MA>HS\/HA, and LS\/LA>LS\/MA as shown in Fig.\u00a0 b. Thus, brain activity exhibits response specificity across anticipation cues that elicit different degrees of anxiety and pain.   \nTemporal correlation of the peripheral and cerebral hemodynamic responses during pain anticipation across sessions for all participants.

(  b  ) Axial and sagittal views of the brain when   s. \n  \n\nFinally, time-series waveforms of the peripheral arterial stiffness index were incorporated as covariates of interest in the voxel-wise GLM analysis to determine the attribution of its responses in terms of temporal correlation between cerebral and peripheral hemodynamic responses. Cerebral hemodynamic responses to the anticipation of pain were found to be significantly covariant with peripheral hemodynamic responses as shown in Fig.\u00a0 a, reaching its strongest covariation (1844 voxels) at  1 s out of a significant time lag of  2 to 1 s. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 b, the co-activated brain regions included the secondary visual cortex (V2), INS, VLPFC, DLPFC, and ACC, which were associated with the anticipation of pain induced by visual transmission, providing evidence that peripheral hemodynamic arousal could be a manifestation of cerebral activation due to pain anticipation. Similarly, the strongest covariation (236 voxels) between the cerebral and peripheral hemodynamic responses to pain perception was observed at   s out of a significant time lag of  2 to 0 s, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 a. The co-activated brain regions included the S1 and SMG involved in pain perception as shown in Fig.\u00a0 b. This evidences a distinct central modulation of the cardiovascular system during painful stimuli, differing from that in pain anticipation. Together, these findings suggest that peripheral hemodynamic responses characterized by the index are centrally modulated differentially during the anticipation and perception of pain and exhibit a 1-s lag over the cerebral hemodynamic response.   \nTemporal correlation of the peripheral and cerebral hemodynamic responses during pain perception across sessions for all participants.

To this end, four anticipation cues were applied to healthy human participants with multiple biosignals measured simultaneously in an MRI environment. Subjective ratings suggested that anticipation of pain influenced pain perception only at the low stimulus intensity, whereas painful stimulus intensity was the primary determinant of peripheral hemodynamic responses. Neuroimaging analyses of fMRI data revealed that the brain was activated in anticipation and perception and exhibited a higher specificity in response to different anticipation cues. Central to the fMRI-based evidence was a co-varying analysis of cerebral and peripheral hemodynamic responses, which enabled the translation of the two responses from their temporal correlation to the underlying innervation mechanisms, yielding direct evidence for a sympathetic correlation between the brain and the periphery . \n\n### Anticipation effects on pain perception \n  \nAnticipation cues intervened in pain perception by recruiting anxiety under low-intensity stimuli, and its anticipation effects failed under high-intensity stimuli. Uncertainty about the intensity of an impending painful stimulus (MA) triggered comparable levels of anxiety as certainty about a high-intensity stimulus, suggesting a mediating role for predictability in shaping pain perception by harnessing potential anxiety or fear . The underlying dose-response relationship between anticipation cues and pain intensity indicates a positive contribution of moderate anticipatory activation in eliciting anxiety and hyperalgesia . Furthermore, a negative effect on participants\u2019 cognitive appraisal of impending pain was discerned based on the approximately linear dose-response relationships involving pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings. This finding forwards the bidirectional relationship between pain and cognition and indicates the potential for differential modulation of brain activity and subsequent peripheral responses in anticipation of pain . Therefore, the designed anticipation cues enabled different anticipatory effects on pain perception, providing a valid experimental basis for subsequent analyses of cerebral and peripheral hemodynamic responsivity. \n\n#### Bodily responsivity in anticipation and perception of pain \n  \nThe peripheral hemodynamic responses were aroused and modulated through different neural pathways in the anticipation and perception of pain, thus exhibiting different responsivities characterized by the peripheral arterial stiffness index. Cortical cardiovascular modulation is directly involved in anticipation of pain without sensory afferent signals, whereas medullary modulation dominates pain perception following pain afferents . Both types of central regulation involve the mediated activation of the SNS and its tonic constricting effect on the vascular smooth muscle cells of the peripheral arterial wall, leading to the resulting rise in the index. The nerve conduction velocities of sympathetic vasoconstrictor and sudomotor bursts recorded from the tibial nerve are approximately 0.76 and 0.95 m\/s, and changes in skin conductance due to sweating in the hands were reported an onset latency of 1.3\u20131.5 s . In addition, the BOLD response typically has a delay of 1\u20132 s to the stimulus, peaking around 4\u20136 s after stimulus onset . Overall, a top-down innervation of the periphery can be inferred using the peripheral arterial stiffness index based on the 1-s lag between peripheral and cerebral hemodynamic responses . \n\nConcurrently, discrepancies in the response specificity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index between periods of pain anticipation and pain perception were also revealed based on its responses across anticipation cues. Whereas different brain regions activated across periods and anticipation cues lead to different responsivity of the index, it is also plausible for functional connectivity between relevant regions to contribute to the responsivity . There is some evidence that functional connectivity for pain anticipation extends from higher-order to sensory brain regions, and the opposite is true for pain perception, which is consistent with the direction of central innervation of the SNS. More importantly, pain anticipation has been demonstrated to primarily affect interregional functional connectivity rather than altering local brain activity, whereas pain perception primarily impacts local brain activity based on stimulus intensity . Hence, the absence of significant variation in local brain activity may contribute to the low responsivity of the index in anticipation of pain. However, this evidence does not account for the potential impacts of uncertainty about stimulus intensity and the resulting anxiety on brain activity. Our findings may capture the mediating role of predictability and its subsequent effect on brain activity levels and regions during pain anticipation, which may minimally impact peripheral hemodynamic responses. Combined with the fact that the responsivity of the index coincides with the responsivity of brain activity in response to painful stimuli , the validity of the index in the early detection and assessment of pain experience is clarified on the basis of neuroimaging evidence. \n\n\n#### Underlying mechanisms bridge cerebral and peripheral responses \n  \nOur findings on the temporal correlation analyses suggest that the link between cerebral and peripheral hemodynamics may lie in the 1-s lag observed through the peripheral arterial stiffness index. A few studies have shown evidence that functional interactions in the brain could be extended to the heart in a bidirectional manner through sympathovagal control . Furthermore, this bidirectional mechanism has also been confirmed to maintain fear balance across fear levels by stressing the upward input of the vagus nerve to the INS . Thus, the mediating role of the autonomic nervous system may underline a similar bidirectional relationship of neural control between brain activity and peripheral hemodynamics in the anticipation and perception of pain. Although there is consensus on the lack of direct innervation of the peripheral arteries by the vagus nerve, the withdrawal of sympathetic tone may be attributed to upward signaling of vagal activation, which could modulate cerebrovascular tone and further interact with brain activity . Therefore, the relationship between vagal innervation and this index should be further clarified on the basis of cerebral and peripheral hemodynamics. Moreover, the duration and level of SNS activation are related to the bodily modulation of pain , which can be quantified by the index. Therefore, this evidence sets the stage for future work with the specific aim of incorporating peripheral hemodynamics modeled by the index into the analysis of interregional functional connectivity between the brain and periphery in order to investigate the bottom-up influence on brain activity in the anticipation and perception of pain by establishing a global BOLD signal. \n\n\n#### Limitations \n  \nConsidering the gender differences in pain perception and anxiety , the results obtained in this study should be further validated in female participants. The low levels of sympathetic activation associated with the experimental protocol were elicited under low intensity and short duration of the stimulus. Consequently, the underlying cause of the low responsivity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index may be the low degree of anxiety in anticipation of pain. Then, the temporal lag between peripheral and cerebral hemodynamic responses cannot be accurately interpreted due to the lack of direct measurements of neural activity in the SNS. Moreover, although the two sessions were analyzed separately, further studies are needed to investigate adaptations in participants\u2019 brain activity, arterial stiffness, or reported sensations between sessions. Finally, the index quantifies functional changes in arterial stiffness in response to sympathetic activation due to stimuli or triggers. Therefore, its applicability to pathological subjects with different degrees of arterial stiffness (e.g., hypertensive patients) requires further evaluation. \n\n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study leverages neuroimaging-based evidence to elucidate the response specificity of the peripheral arterial stiffness index to pain anticipation and perception, suggesting a sympathetic correlation between brain activity and peripheral vasomotion. The low responsivity during pain anticipation, high responsivity during pain perception, and the lagging characteristics of the index suggest that pain experiences of varying emotions and degrees lead to different characteristic patterning of central innervation and resulting differences in SNS activation. These results provide parallel neuroimaging and neurophysiological insights into cerebral and peripheral mechanisms of pain and its anticipation, fostering an unbiased approach to perceiving and assessing individual pain experiences. Furthermore, this study justifies efforts to unravel the link between the brain and the periphery, delivering a more comprehensive understanding of bodily responses to stimuli and informing the development of more clinically effective interventions for pain alleviation. \n\nTo refine the global hemodynamic linkage, further analyses of the interregional functional connectivity of pain anticipation and perception are necessary by incorporating the peripheral arterial stiffness index. It is also imperative to evaluate and synopsize the response characteristics of the index to remove the need for direct measurement of neural activity, thus providing firmer theoretical evidence for global hemodynamics. Furthermore, clinical patients should be considered in future studies to explore relevant pathologic changes and to provide further information about potential starting points for pain interventions. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10858222,"text_md5":"6b4f6acfaf1f829c8255ac11ac31a26e","field_positions":{"authors":[0,137],"journal":[138,145],"publication_year":[147,151],"title":[162,291],"keywords":[305,341],"abstract":[354,2170],"body":[2179,44596]},"batch":1,"pmid":38337009,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-024-53921-4","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10858222","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10858222"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10858222\">10858222<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10858222  Neuroimaging-based evidence for sympathetic correlation between brain activity and peripheral vasomotion during pain anticipation"}
{"text":"Dureux, Audrey and Zanini, Alessandro and Everling, Stefan\nCommun Biol, 2024\n\n# Title\n\nMapping of facial and vocal processing in common marmosets with ultra-high field fMRI\n\n# Keywords\n\nCognitive neuroscience\nSocial neuroscience\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nPrimate communication relies on multimodal cues, such as vision and audition, to facilitate the exchange of intentions, enable social interactions, avoid predators, and foster group cohesion during daily activities. Understanding the integration of facial and vocal signals is pivotal to comprehend social interaction. In this study, we acquire whole-brain ultra-high field (9.4\u2009T) fMRI data from awake marmosets (  Callithrix jacchus  ) to explore brain responses to unimodal and combined facial and vocal stimuli. Our findings reveal that the multisensory condition not only intensifies activations in the occipito-temporal face patches and auditory voice patches but also engages a more extensive network that includes additional parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas, compared to the summed responses of the unimodal conditions. By uncovering the neural network underlying multisensory audiovisual integration in marmosets, this study highlights the efficiency and adaptability of the marmoset brain in processing facial and vocal social signals, providing significant insights into primate social communication. \n  \n9.4\u2009T fMRI in marmosets shows a specialized brain network for face-voice cues processing, involving face patches and vocal areas along with parietal,\u00a0prefrontal and cingulate cortices allowing complex social communication. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPrimates emit a variety of signals during daily social communication, expressing specific emotional states, intentions, activities, or responses to external environmental features . These complex signals encompass visual, tactile, olfactory and auditory cues , with facial expressions and vocalizations serving as the primary sources for face-to-face primate communication, a notion already postulated by Charles Darwin . The crossmodal integration of facial expressions and vocalizations is vital for perceiving a conspecific\u2019s vocalization and concurrent facial behavior . \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that humans, Old-World macaque monkeys, and New-World marmosets share a face processing system, consisting of interconnected patches distributed across the temporal and prefrontal cortex. In humans, face-selective patches are found in the lateral occipital cortex, the fusiform gyrus and in anterior and posterior regions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) . In macaques, these patches are located along the occipitotemporal axis mainly along the STS and in the frontal cortex . In marmosets, similar patches have been identified along the\u00a0occipitotemporal axis and in\u00a0the lateral frontal cortex , following a similar organization as in macaques and humans . \n\nSeveral studies have also associated the processing of negative facial expressions with higher activations in temporal face-selective regions and in prefrontal and subcortical areas in both humans and macaques , a pattern that we also recently observed in marmosets . Furthermore, vocalizations and vocal production contribute to interaction and cohesion within primate groups . fMRI studies in humans have identified three voice-selective patches located along the mid-superior temporal gyrus to the anterior superior temporal gyrus (TVAa, TVAm, TVAp) and in premotor and inferior frontal areas . \n\nIn macaques, two clusters in the STS have been identified with stronger activations for vocalizations than for other sounds categories . Additionally, the recent discovery of a vocalization-selective cluster in the macaque anterior temporal pole suggests a similar functional organization of higher-level auditory cortex in macaques and humans . These results suggest that vocalization processing is organized in \u2018voice patches\u2019 in the temporal lobe, analogous to the well-establish \u2018face-patches\u2019 . \n\nRecently, we identified in marmosets a network akin to what was seen in humans. Vocalization-selective activations were observed in temporal, frontal and anterior cingulate cortices . Furthermore, three voice patches were discerned along the STS, potentially homologous to the three human voice patches . \n\nThe association between facial expressions and specific vocalizations enables a nuanced understanding of social cues, enhancing communication and social bonding among primate groups . Yet, even though facial and vocal patches in primates have been individually studied, the process of integrating these multisensory signals during social interactions remains intricate and not fully understood. \n\nRecent studies have begun to elucidate the neural substrates of multisensory integration in primates, demonstrating that audiovisual integration of social cues\u2014specifically, faces and vocalizations\u2014occurs in particular regions of the monkey face-patch and voice-patch systems  as well as in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) . Human studies have also highlighted the involvement of temporal , frontal , and parietal  cortices in the processing of combined visual and auditory social information. \n\nThe field of multisensory integration in primate communication has been extensively explored in Old-World primates and humans. However, in New-World monkeys, the common marmoset (  Callithrix jacchus  ) presents distinctive social behaviors, such as cooperative care of offspring and complex vocal communication, which are less common in Old-World species . These unique characteristics of marmosets provide a valuable comparative model that can enhance our understanding of the evolution of neural mechanisms underlying social behaviors and inform the study of human social cognition and disorders . In this context, the present study aims to explore the neural circuits for social multisensory integration in the common marmoset, an area so far unexplored. Utilizing ultra-high field MRI, we acquired whole-brain fMRI data from six awake marmosets while the animals were presented with videos of conspecific faces with no sounds, conspecific vocalizations with no videos, videos of conspecific faces with corresponding vocalizations, and scrambled versions of each of these conditions. By mapping these neural networks, we not only fill a significant gap in the literature but also provide insights that may be crucial for understanding the evolution of primate social communication and its implications for human social cognition, offering a potential avenue for translational research into social behavior and its disorders. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn this study, we employed ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4\u2009T to examine the neural correlates of multisensory processing in six awake common marmoset monkeys. Data were collected using a custom-built gradient coil with a 15\u2009cm inner diameter and a maximum gradient strength of 1.5\u2009mT\/m\/A, coupled with an 8-channel receive coil  (Fig.\u00a0 ). The image quality of the functional runs was assessed by the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), demonstrating high-quality data acquisition (Fig.\u00a0 ).

All elements were photographed by the authors.   b   Representation of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) achieved at 9.4\u2009T, indicating the high-quality data acquisition enabled (adapted from  with permission).   c   Schematic of brain coverage, designed by the authors, illustrating the fMRI scan achieved through 42 axial slices with an isotropic resolution of 0.5\u2009mm, superimposed on the NIH marmoset brain template  (publicly available).   d   Depiction of the stimuli used in the experiment, categorized into three intact and three scrambled conditions: 1) unimodal videos of marmoset faces, 2) unimodal marmoset vocalizations, and 3) multimodal presentation of marmoset faces with corresponding vocalizations. Screenshots from the original recorded videos and custom-generated sound histograms, alongside custom-created icons for movies and sounds in PowerPoint, are by the authors.   e   Schematic of the sparse fMRI block design created by the authors, showing the temporal sequence of the presentation of intact and scrambled stimuli, each lasting 12\u2009s, interspersed with 15\u2009s baseline periods marked by a central fixation dot. During each run, the six conditions were presented in a randomized order and repeated four times, resulting in a total of 24 stimulus blocks and 25 baseline blocks. Each 3-second repetition time (TR) included a silent period of 1.5\u2009s to ensure accurate perception of auditory stimuli. \n  \n\nDuring scanning sessions, monkeys were positioned in a sphinx posture within an MRI-compatible restraint system, with their heads secured using a head post and MRI-compatible auditory tubes placed directly into their ear canals. \n\nWe acquired eight functional runs per animal, covering the whole brain with 42 axial slices at an isotropic resolution of 0.5\u2009mm (Fig.\u00a0 ). To mitigate the masking of auditory stimuli by scanner noise, we implemented a continuous acquisition paradigm incorporating silent periods of 1.5\u2009s within each 3-second TR . Our block-design experiment utilized various stimuli, including marmoset face videos, vocalizations, marmoset face videos with corresponding vocalizations, and their scrambled versions, each presented for 12\u2009s in a randomized sequence interspersed with 15-second baseline periods (Fig.\u00a0 d,  ). \n\nFor detailed information on all methodological specifics, including surgical and anesthesia procedures, MRI training, positioning of marmosets within the MRI-compatible body restraint, fMRI scanning at 9.4\u2009T, and preprocessing and statistical analysis of functional images, please refer to the methods section and the recent protocol paper by our group . \n\nOur primary objective was to uncover the neural architecture responsible for processing and integrating face and vocal signals in marmosets. Specifically, we sought to identify the brain regions responsive to face and vocalization processing, and the regions that were\u00a0 activated by these combined signals. Our analysis included the creation of conjunction maps to explore both specific and common activations among these conditions, and the examination of the superadditive effect to investigate the responses to combined audiovisual stimulation. \n\n### Functional brain activations during the processing of visual signals \n  \nInitially, we examined the processing of marmoset face videos and their corresponding scrambled versions, compared to a baseline period where only a central dot was presented on the screen. The group activation maps for each condition, focusing on the left hemisphere, are depicted in Fig.\u00a0 a,  . For a detailed visualization of the activation maps of the right hemisphere, see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  et 1d. Marmoset face videos (Fig.\u00a0 ) recruited a bilateral network primarily along the occipitotemporal axis, encompassing visual areas V1, V2, V3, V4, V4T, MT, V6, dorsointermediate part (19DI), lateral and inferior temporal areas TE1, TE2, TE3, TEO, the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST), PGa-IPa, and ventral temporal areas 35, 36. The scrambled face videos (Fig.\u00a0 ) activated visual areas V1, V2, V3, V4T, MT, and the FST area. Subcortically, bilateral pulvinar, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and right amygdala were recruited by face videos, whereas no activations were observed for scrambled faces.    Brain networks activated by each condition   versus   baseline.  \nThis figure represents the group functional maps for each condition, showing significantly greater activations compared to baseline\u00a0for marmoset face videos (  a  ), marmoset vocalizations (  b  ), marmoset face videos with corresponding vocalizations (  c  ), scrambled marmoset face videos (  d  ), scrambled marmoset vocalizations (  e  ), and scrambled marmoset face videos with corresponding scrambled vocalizations (  f  ). These group maps are based on data from six awake marmosets and are displayed on both lateral and medial views of the fiducial marmoset cortical surfaces, left hemisphere. Subcortical activations are represented on coronal slices. The white line delineates the regions based on the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . The reported brain areas meet an activation threshold corresponding to z-scores > 2.57 (p\u2009<\u20090.01, AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+, cluster-size correction \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 from 10000 Monte-Carlo simulations). \n  \n\nNext, we identified brain regions more active during marmoset face observation by comparing the marmoset face videos condition with the scrambled condition (i.e., marmoset face videos > scrambled marmoset face videos contrast). The group activation map depicted in Fig.\u00a0  revealed significant activations for marmoset faces compared to scrambled faces in a bilateral network comprising regions in the occipital cortex (i.e., V1, V2, V3, V4, V4t), and the temporal cortex (i.e., TEO, FST, TE1, TE2, TE3, 35, 36, entorhinal cortex). We also observed higher activations in area 19DI on the left hemisphere and in subcortical areas in the right pulvinar and the right amygdala (Fig.\u00a0 ).    Brain networks involved in processing intact   versus   scrambled conditions.  \nThe group functional maps illustrate significantly greater activations for the comparison between (  a  ) marmoset face videos and scrambled marmoset face videos,   b   marmoset vocalizations and scrambled marmoset vocalizations, and (  c  ) marmoset face videos paired with corresponding vocalizations and their scrambled versions. These group functional topology comparisons are displayed on both the left and right fiducial marmoset cortical surfaces (lateral and medial views), as well as on coronal slices, to emphasize activations in subcortical areas. Regions are delineated by white lines, according to the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . Reported brain areas have an activation threshold corresponding to z-scores > 2.57 (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+, cluster-size correction \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 from 10000 Monte-Carlo simulations). \n  \n\nFor detailed quantitative comparisons of activation levels in various cortical regions under these conditions, refer to the bar graphs presented in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . These graphs visually demonstrate the variations in response levels across conditions and provide the statistical insights into the differences between them. \n\n\n### Functional brain activations during the processing of auditory signals \n  \nNext, we explored the activation patterns for vocalization processing by analyzing each auditory condition \u2013 marmoset vocalizations and scrambled marmoset vocalizations \u2013 compared to the baseline period. The group activation maps for these conditions, focusing on the left hemisphere, are depicted in Fig.\u00a0 b,  . For detailed visualization of the activation maps of the right hemisphere under these conditions, see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ,  . For quantitative comparisons of activation levels in various cortical regions under these auditory conditions, refer to the bar graphs presented in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  and to the Supplementary Table\u00a0 . \n\nMarmoset vocalizations (Fig.\u00a0 ) elicited bilateral brain activations in primary auditory cortex, including the core (primary area [A1] and rostral field [R], rostral temporal [RT]), belt (caudomedial [CM], caudolateral [CL], mediolateral [ML], rostromedial [RM], anterolateral [AL], rostrotemporal medial [RTM], rostrotemporal lateral [RTL]), and parabelt areas (caudal parabelt [CPB], rostral parabelt [RPB]). Additionally, activations were found in V1, V2, GI, TE1, TH, the medial superior temporal area (MST), the temporo-parietal-occipital area (TPO), the superior temporal rostral area (STR), the retroinsular area (ReI), as well as in bilateral frontal areas, including primary motor cortex 4ab, somatosensory cortex areas 3a, 3b and 1\/2, premotor areas 6DR, 6DC, cingulate area 24c and in left cingulate areas 32, 32\u2009v and 25. In the right hemisphere, there were also activations in S2I, DI, Ipro, agranular insular cortex (AI), medial part of parainsular cortex (PaIM) and 8aV. \n\nScrambled vocalizations (Fig.\u00a0 ) elicited responses mostly confined to the auditory cortex, with bilateral activations in core (A1, R, RT), belt (CM, CL, ML, RM, AL, RTM, RTL) and parabelt (CPB) cortices, as well as activations in the\u00a0right hemisphere in adjacent areas TPO, MST, STR, GI, GI, DI, S2I, Ipro and PaIM. \n\nTo directly identify cortical and subcortical clusters that were more active for vocalizations, we compared the vocal to the scrambled conditions (i.e., marmoset vocalizations > scrambled marmoset vocalizations contrast). The group map in Fig.\u00a0  shows stronger activations for vocalizations in R and RT areas of the core auditory cortex, in AL, ML, RTM, RTL areas of the belt auditory cortex and in RPB and CPM areas of the parabelt auditory cortex. We also found higher activations in occipito-temporal cortex in V1, V2, V2, V4, V4t, V5, TEO, FST, Pga-IPa, TPO, TE3, TE2, TE1, STR, 36, 35, Ent, and PaIM areas. More anteriorly, we found greater activations in the premotor cortex in bilateral area 6 ventral part (6Va) and in right areas 8 caudal part (8\u2009C) and 6DR; in the frontal cortex in bilateral areas 8Av, 45 and 47 medial part (47\u2009M) as well as in the right orbitofrontal cortex in areas 47\u2009O, 13 lateral (13\u2009L), 11 and orbital periallocortex (OPAI). Finally, higher activations were found in bilateral rostral cingulate areas 25, 32, and 29d. At the subcortical level, vocalizations induced stronger activations in the superior colliculus (SC), medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), caudate, pulvinar, and amygdala (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Functional brain activations during the processing of audiovisual signals \n  \nIn the intact audiovisual condition, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0  (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  for visualization of the right hemisphere) - where marmoset faces were combined with corresponding vocalizations - we identified activations that reflected the combination of the previously described unimodal maps (Fig.\u00a0 a,  ), alongside additional parietal, cingulate and frontal areas (Fig.\u00a0 ). Specifically, we observed activations in the previously mentioned areas along the occipital-temporal axis (i.e., bilateral V1, V2, V2, V4, V4t, MT, 19DI, TEO, MST, FST, Pga-IPa, TPO, TE3, TE2, TE1, STR, 36, 35, Ent), in auditory regions of the core, belt and parabelt cortices (i.e., bilateral A1, R, RT, CM, CL, ML, RM, AL, RTM, RTL, RPB, CPB), as well as in regions of the prefrontal and premotor cortices (i.e., bilateral 8aD, 8Av, 6Va, 45, 47\u2009M, 47\u2009O and 6DR). Beyond these areas, we found activations in bilateral posterior parietal areas surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), including the occipito-pareital transitional areas (OPt), and the anterior, lateral, medial and ventral intraparietal areas (AIP, LIP, MIP and VIP), as well as PG, PFG, PE and PGM areas. Within the cingulate cortex, activations were present in bilateral areas 32, 25, 24a, 23b, 30 and 29d. \n\nIn the scrambled audiovisual condition depicted in Fig.\u00a0  (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  for visualization of the right hemisphere) - where scrambled marmoset faces were associated with scrambled corresponding vocalizations - there were strong activations in bilateral auditory areas (i.e., A1, R, RT, CM, CL, ML, RM, AL, RTM, RTL, RPB, CPB), and in adjacent areas STR, TPO, MST, ReI, FST and Pga-IPa. Temporal areas TE3 and TEO, visual areas V1, V2, V3, V4t, MT, V6, as well as parietal areas LIP, PFG and PG were also recruited. In the right hemisphere, we also observed activations in areas 8Av, 45, and in the insular areas GI, DI, AI. \n\nQuantitative comparisons of activation levels in these cortical regions are further detailed in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nWhen comparing marmoset faces paired with corresponding vocalizations to their scrambled versions (Fig.\u00a0 ) (i.e., marmoset face videos with corresponding vocalizations condition > scrambled marmoset face videos with corresponding scrambled vocalizations condition), we found stronger activations for the intact stimuli in the occipitotemporal, frontal and orbitofrontal cortices in bilateral areas V1, V2, V3, V4, MT, V4t, FST, Pga-IPa, TPO, TE3, TE2, TE1, 35, 36, 8Av, 6Va, 45, 47\u2009M, 13\u2009L, 47\u2009O, OPAI, as well as in left areas 8aD, 6DR, 13\u2009M and in right areas 8\u2009C and PaIM. However, no greater activations were found in the primary auditory cortex. Subcortically, greater activations were found in SC, pulvinar and amygdala (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nOur results indicate that the integration of audiovisual signals involves a broad network, which includes not only the distinct face and vocal processing networks but also extends to encompass parietal, cingulate, and prefrontal regions. Notably, the intact and coherent pairing of marmoset faces with vocalizations\u2014compared to their scrambled and incoherent counterparts\u2014showed preferential processing along the occipitotemporal axis, in both the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices, and within the anterior cingulate cortex, especially area 32. \n\n\n### Common and distinct brain regions involved in processing visual, auditory and audiovisual signals \n  \nTo identify common and distinct brain regions engaged in processing visual, auditory, and audiovisual modalities, we conducted a conjunction analysis separately for intact and scrambled conditions. The results of this analysis are displayed in Fig.\u00a0  (intact stimuli) and Fig.\u00a0  (scrambled stimuli). Our findings revealed a substantial overlap between the visual and auditory activation maps with the multisensory map (depicted in yellow and purple in Fig.\u00a0 ).    Spatial overlap of cluster networks for visual, auditory, and audiovisual processing in intact and scrambled conditions.  \nMarmoset cortical surfaces for intact (  a  ) and scrambled (  b  ) conditions of both hemispheres are shown, displaying all significant voxels (z-scores >\u20092.57;   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+, cluster-size correction \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 from 10000 Monte-Carlo simulations) as blue (unimodal visual condition > baseline), green (unimodal auditory condition >\u2009baseline), or red (audiovisual condition > baseline). Network overlap is indicated by the color key above the surface maps. Regions are delineated by white lines, according to the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . \n  \n\nSignificantly, additional brain regions in the frontal, cingulate, and parietal cortices were found to be engaged only during multisensory stimulation (shown in red in Fig.\u00a0 ). This observation suggests that multisensory processing is not a simple summation of each modality but also involves additional brain regions. Both the intact and scrambled maps selectively activated bilateral posterior parietal areas (i.e., AIP, LIP, MIP, VIP, PG, PFG, PE, PGM) and cingulate areas (i.e., 29d, 30, 24a), with the intact condition further recruiting other cingulate areas (23b, 23a, 24c) and portions of rostral cingulate areas 25 and 32. Interestingly, the anterior portion of area 32 was solely activated by auditory stimulation (shown in green in Fig.\u00a0 ), while its most posterior portion was only activated by multisensory stimulation (depicted in red in Fig.\u00a0 ). Between these, the region was commonly activated by both auditory and multisensory conditions (indicated in yellow in Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nIn addition, certain prefrontal areas (8Av, 8aD) and premotor areas (6DR, 6DC) in the right hemisphere were shared between the auditory and multisensory intact maps (shown in yellow in Fig.\u00a0 ). However, other bilateral prefrontal (45, 47\u2009M, 47\u2009O) and orbitofrontal areas (11, 13\u2009L, Opro, OPAI) were specifically activated by the intact multisensory condition (depicted in red in Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nFor the scrambled condition, only portions of areas 6DR, 6DC, 8\u2009C, 8Av, 8aD, 47\u2009M, 47\u2009O in the right hemisphere were activated by the audiovisual stimuli (Fig.\u00a0 , shown in red). \n\nOverall, for the intact audiovisual conditions, regions responding primarily to visual stimulation (and not auditory) were predominantly concentrated in the occipital and temporal cortices (Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast, areas activated by auditory stimulation (but not visual) were situated in the primary auditory cortex, premotor cortex, and inferior frontal cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). These regions also responded to combined audiovisual stimulation (Figs.\u00a0 c and  , shown in yellow and purple). Notably, no regions were identified that responded to both unimodal auditory and visual conditions (absence of light blue in Fig.\u00a0 ). Areas responsive to combined audiovisual stimulation, but not to unimodal visual and auditory stimulation, were distributed across frontal, cingulate, and parietal regions (Fig.\u00a0 , shown in red). For the scrambled audiovisual conditions, regions responding to visual but not auditory stimuli remained concentrated in the occipital and temporal cortex, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig.\u00a0 ). The areas activated by auditory but not visual stimuli were primarily situated in the primary auditory cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). These regions also responded to combined audiovisual stimulation (Figs.\u00a0 f and  , shown in yellow and purple). In this scrambled condition, areas solely responsive to audiovisual stimuli were mainly observed in parietal regions, with only a few in cingulate and right prefrontal regions (Fig.\u00a0 , shown in red). \n\nIn summary, the intact, coherent conditions engage a more expansive neural network than the scrambled, incoherent ones, underscoring the intricate interplay of marmoset faces and vocalizations within the brain. The integration of these specific cues thus seems to engage extra brain regions, beyond those commonly activated by general audiovisual multisensory stimuli, as evidenced in the scrambled multimodal scenario. \n\nWe subsequently conducted a conjunction analysis to compare intact versus scrambled stimuli for marmoset faces, vocalizations, and their combined presentation. This was done to discern the common and distinct brain regions involved in processing coherent social signals from faces, vocalizations, and their integrated form. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 , the green and blue regions demonstrate preferential activations for intact vocalizations and faces, respectively. The green regions encompassed the auditory cortex, including core, belt, and parabelt areas, and some motor and somatosensory areas, underscoring vocalization-specific processing. In contrast, the blue regions, localized to sections of temporal areas TE2 and TE1, signal face-specific responses. The red regions, predominantly located in the posterior parietal, prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices, highlight areas that are uniquely responsive to a coherent combination of marmoset faces and vocalizations, as opposed to their scrambled versions.    Spatial overlap of cluster networks for the comparison between intact and scrambled conditions for faces, vocalizations, and combined faces with corresponding vocalization.  \nMarmoset cortical surfaces of both hemispheres are shown, displaying all significant voxels (z-scores > 2.57;   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+, cluster-size correction \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 from 10000 Monte-Carlo simulations) as blue (unimodal condition marmoset faces > scrambled marmoset faces), green (unimodal condition marmoset vocalizations > marmoset scrambled vocalizations), or red (audiovisual condition marmoset faces with corresponding vocalizations > scrambled marmoset faces with corresponding scrambled vocalizations). Network overlap is indicated by the color key above the surface maps. Regions are delineated by white lines, according to the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . \n  \n\nThe overlaid regions, delineated in purple, clear blue, yellow, and white, signify converging neural responses between the different contrasts. Specifically, the white regions along the occipitotemporal axis, encompassing V2, V3, V4, V4t, TEO, and parts of FST, TE3, TE2, and TE1, denote a common response to all three intact versus scrambled stimulus categories. \n\nThe yellow regions, involving portions of prefrontal area 45, premotor area 6Va, FST, Pga-IPA, MT, STR, PaIM, and early visual areas V1 and V2, show a shared neural response for processing both vocalizations and the integration of faces with corresponding vocalizations. In line with our previous results (Fig.\u00a0 ), the anterior section of area 32 shows a distinct response to intact vocalizations (in green), the posterior section to the integrated face-vocalization stimuli (in red), and an intermediate zone to both (in yellow). Notably, no regions showed a dual response to both marmoset faces and vocalizations or to marmoset faces and the combination of faces and vocalizations (indicated by the absence of light blue and purple). \n\nIn summary, our findings from the conjunction analysis reveal a nuanced neural representation of social stimuli, distinguishing specific and shared processing networks for marmoset faces, vocalizations, and their integrated combinations. A consistent network across the occipitotemporal axis responds to all three modalities when comparing intact to scrambled versions, suggesting an ability to process complex social cues. This network, with the engagement of additional parietal and frontal regions, which are specifically recruited for processing the integrated presentation of marmoset faces with vocalizations, allow multisensory integration in the marmoset brain. \n\n\n### Positive interaction for combined audiovisual signals: superadditive effect \n  \nTo determine the superadditive effect \u2013 corresponding to an increased activation when subjects integrate multimodal information compared to the sum of activations from single-modality inputs - we created activation maps displaying regions with stronger activations for the combined auditory and visual face-related information conditions compared to the sum of responses from unimodal face and vocal conditions (i.e., face videos with corresponding vocalizations > face videos + vocalizations). \n\nThis contrast, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0  for intact conditions and Fig.   for scrambled conditions, revealed that areas in the temporal (i.e., bilateral areas TEO, FST, MST, PGa-IPa, TE3, TE2, TE1, TPO, 36), parietal (i.e., bilateral areas MIP, LIP, VIP, AIP, PG, PE, PFG, PGM), cingulate (i.e., bilateral areas 23b, 23a, 29d, 30, 24a), as well as premotor and prefrontal (i.e., areas 8Av, 6va, 8\u2009C, 8aD, 6DR, 47\u2009M, 47\u2009O bilateral for intact and right for scrambled) cortices responded more robustly to combined audiovisual conditions compared to the cumulative response of isolated auditory and visual conditions. Furthermore, while visual (i.e., bilateral areas V1, V2, V3, V4, MT, V6, V3A, V4t, 19DI) and auditory (comprising bilateral regions like A1, CM, ML, CL, CPB, RBP) cortices also displayed notable response differences between multimodal and unimodal stimulations, the most significant variance in activations was primarily located in the temporal, parietal, and cingulate regions.    Superadditive neural processing of multisensory face and vocal signals.  \nGroup functional maps illustrate significantly greater responses to the multisensory audiovisual conditions compared to the sum of the responses for its unimodal constituents for both intact (  a  ) and scrambled (  b  ) stimuli. Significant differences were determined with paired t-tests, thresholded at z\u2009>\u20092.57 (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+, cluster-size correction \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 from 10000 Monte-Carlo simulations). The group functional topology comparisons are displayed on both left and right fiducial marmoset cortical surfaces, as well as on coronal slices. Regions are delineated by white lines, according to the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . \n  \n\nSubcortically, structures such as the superior colliculus, caudate, MGN, pulvinar, and amygdala exhibited a stronger response to the multisensory condition compared to the combined responses of unimodal conditions. Overall, this multimodal enhancement effect was more pronounced and extensive for intact conditions compared to scrambled conditions. Notably, area 32 was activated solely by the intact contrast. \n\nTo provide a more detailed understanding of these observations, we included bar graphs in the supplementary information (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), which display the beta values of various regions of interest (ROIs) under the different conditions. Additionally, our statistical analysis, which compared the beta values in the multisensory condition (faces with vocalizations) against the combined beta values from the unimodal conditions (faces + vocalizations) across these ROIs, revealed significant superadditive effects in all the ROIs, except for the frontal region 11 of the left hemisphere (all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.01, except for area 11 left hemisphere). This analysis underscores the nuanced and robust nature of the superadditive response, especially in regions involved in sensory integration and higher-order processing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study aimed to identify the distinct and shared neural substrates responsible for processing marmoset faces, vocalizations, and the combination of marmoset faces with their associated vocalizations. Within this multisensory framework, we further examined how these integrated audiovisual signals are processed in comparison to unimodal auditory and visual stimuli. The ability to recognize and integrate social cues is crucial for effective communication. Our central hypothesis proposed that marmosets process face and vocal signals in distinct face and vocal patches within their temporal and frontal cortices, and that these patches should also be involved in audiovisual multisensory processing, with responses to combined stimuli exceeding the summed responses of individual auditory and visual stimuli - a phenomenon known as superadditivity. \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we utilized ultra-high field fMRI acquisitions and exposed awake marmosets to various stimuli, including marmoset face videos, vocalizations, and their corresponding scrambled versions both separately and in combination. \n\nThe ability to recognize faces is paramount in deciphering the intentions of others, making the differentiation and interpretation of facial expressions vital for social communication . Previous fMRI research on face processing in human and nonhuman primates has identified face patches located across temporal and prefrontal cortices, which responded strongly to faces compared to non-face objects or scrambled faces . Our results from visual stimulation depicting marmoset face videos, as well as comparisons of these videos to their scrambled versions, are consistent with recent investigations into face processing in marmosets. These results emphasize the role of occipito-temporal regions in processing faces and facial expressions . These areas display robust activation in V2\/V3, V4\/TEO, V4t\/FST, TE2-TE3, corresponding to the previously identified face-patches in marmosets (i.e., patches O (occipital), PV (posterior ventral), PD (posterior dorsal), MD (middle dorsal) and AD (anterior dorsal) respectively) . Subcortically, face videos preferentially recruited the pulvinar, amygdala, and LGN, in contrast to scrambled faces which did not elicit the same responses. The selective activation of the LGN by face videos, and not by scrambled faces, may be influenced by cortical feedback mechanisms. The LGN is typically seen as a primary visual relay, but it is also subject to extensive feedback from cortical areas. This top-down influence from higher-order visual areas to the LGN is known to modulate sensory processing, potentially enhancing or suppressing neural responses based on the context and recognizability of stimuli . In the case of our study, the coherent, structured nature of face videos could engage these feedback pathways more robustly compared to scrambled faces, which lack meaningful visual content. Such dynamics align with the concept that perception is not a mere bottom-up process but a complex interplay of sensory and cognitive factors . Further research into these feedback mechanisms could elucidate how the brain discerns and prioritizes meaningful visual stimuli over less coherent ones. \n\nResearch in primate vocalization processing, another fundamental mode of communication in primates, has revealed the existence of selective voice patches in the temporal cortex, specifically along the STS, and in certain regions of the frontal cortex in humans, macaques, and marmosets . Our results align with these findings and our recent investigation in marmosets , showing similar activations in the primary auditory cortex, rostral cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortices in response to auditory stimulation playing vocalizations. Moreover, we observed comparable activations in the primary auditory cortex and MST for scrambled vocalizations. Intriguingly, our results show that activations in the MST region, for both vocalizations and scrambled vocalizations, are predominantly localized in its rostral part. This specific localization supports the hypothesis proposed by Majka et al. , suggesting that this part of MST might functionally correspond to the caudal subdivision of the superior temporal polysensory area (TPOc), indicating a complex functional anatomy within MST for auditory processing. \n\nOur analysis comparing vocalizations with their scrambled vocalizations has revealed additional activations in regions not observed in our initial study , including areas in occipital, inferior and lateral temporal, as well as prefrontal cortices. This pattern could be attributed to a notable decrease in activity within the occipitotemporal regions during both conditions, with a more significant deactivation during the presentation of the scrambled conditions (refer to Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  for visualization). Such deactivation was absent in our earlier auditory-only study , suggesting that our current experimental design\u2014incorporating visual and audiovisual stimuli either preceding or following the vocalization condition\u2014may influence the neural processing of auditory signals. \n\nMultisensory integration is defined as a process whereby the neuronal responses to two sensory inputs is different from the sum of the neuronal responses to each on its own . Numerous fMRI studies in humans and several electrophysiological studies in macaques have demonstrated audiovisual multisensory interactions in the temporal cortex. Specifically, the STS has been identified as displaying multisensory responses in both humans and macaques, exhibiting enhanced activity for bimodal auditory and visual signals over unimodal ones. Human fMRI studies have confirmed the STS as a multisensory region , emphasizing its specialization in integrating various types of information within modalities (e.g., visual form, visual motion) and across modalities (auditory and visual). In macaques, electrophysiological evidence has revealed that individual neurons in the STS may respond solely to auditory stimuli, exclusively to visual stimuli, or to both auditory and visual stimuli . Additionally, some research has indicated that STS also harbors cells with selective audiovisual responses to faces . \n\nBeyond the STS, recent evidence of audiovisual integration during naturalistic social stimuli has been found in specific regions of the monkey face-patch system , the voice-patch system , and the prefrontal cortex with the presence of multisensory neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) responsive to combined face and voice stimuli . \n\nUnderstanding the bimodal integration of visual and auditory signals in primates has previously been derived exclusively from human and macaque studies, leaving the processing of associations between vocalizations and dynamic faces in marmosets unexplored until now. \n\nIn our study, the multisensory condition, which combined marmoset face videos and corresponding vocalizations, increased the activity of face and voice patches, illustrating the similarity of these areas\u2019 role in audiovisual multisensory integration in marmosets with what has been observed in macaques. Moreover, the activations seen in the TE complex (i.e., TE3, TE2, and TE1) could correspond to the STS responses observed in macaques and humans , further showcasing multisensory integration in these regions in marmosets. A recent electrophysiology study in macaques established that neurons in the anterior fundus face patch in the STS (patch AF) responded to both visual and vocal stimuli, signifying their role in audiovisual integration during social communication . Our findings support this, showing activations in the temporal face-patches regions during the integration of faces and vocalizations. The activations observed in the anterior face patches MD and AD might be equivalent to the AF patch in macaques . \n\nIn the frontal cortex, we also observed activations in various prefrontal areas, unveiling their multisensory role during processing of simultaneous facial expressions and vocalizations. Significantly, the rostral cingulate area 32, previously found to be activated in response to vocalizations in marmosets  and during language processing in humans , was also engaged in voice-face multisensory processing in our study. \n\nOur conjunction analysis revealed that the processing of audiovisual stimulation extended beyond the recruitment of areas solely responsible for unimodal visual and auditory processing. This included not only the regions that process face and vocal signals but also additional cortical areas, suggesting a more intricate network engaged in multisensory integration. This finding highlights the complexity of multisensory processing, shedding new light on the underlying neural mechanisms. The areas activated solely by the multisensory condition were primarily situated in parietal, frontal and cingulate cortices, indicating that these regions may also serve as integrative hubs necessary to process the integration of both visual and auditory information for more efficient social communication. \n\nFirstly, our findings reveal a noteworthy pattern of bilateral posterior parietal activations in response to combined audiovisual stimuli, around the IPS and in parietal areas PF, PE, PFG and PGM. This finding aligns with and extends existing research conducted on humans and macaques, which implicates parietal areas in multisensory processing . In humans, numerous fMRI studies have revealed the involvement of the IPS in tasks that demand the integration of visual and auditory stimuli , aligning well with our present observations in marmosets. In macaques, although some studies suggest audiovisual integration in the posterior parietal cortex, responses to stimuli in bimodal conditions have not been directly examined . Our results with marmosets parallel the findings observed in humans, underscoring the potential evolutionary conservation of this region\u2019s role in multisensory processing across primates. \n\nSecondly, our results reveal several areas in the frontal cortex situated in some lateral prefrontal (i.e., 47\u2009M, 47\u2009O, 45) and orbitofrontal areas (i.e., 11, 13\u2009L, OPro, OPAI), as well as in posterior and anterior cingulate areas (i.e., 29d, 23d, 23a, 30 24a) responding only to the multisensory audiovisual condition. In macaques, the integration of auditory and visual information has been described in the VLPFC. Some studies have shown that single neurons in VLPFC integrate audiovisual species-species face and vocal communication stimuli, suggesting that these neurons are an essential node in the cortical network composed by unimodal auditory and visual regions responsible for communication . \n\nIn humans, fMRI studies have also demonstrated the activation of inferior frontal gyrus during the processing and integration of speech and gestures , suggesting a larger role of the IFG in communication than classical auditory-speech processing . Some studies have further demonstrated a decrease\u00a0activity in ventral prefrontal\u00a0cortex for incongruent faces and voices . In macaque monkey, the evidence shows that cells in the ventral PFC respond to and integrate audiovisual information, with some cells exhibiting multisensory enhancement or suppression when face-vocalization stimuli are combined . In humans, the integration of audiovisual stimuli also occurred at the level of the anterior cingulate\/medial prefrontal cortex . It has been shown that the activity in these areas was enhanced during pairing of congruent and incongruent cross-modal visual and auditory stimuli, and the activation was greater during matching conditions . These results align with our findings in marmosets, with activations for the combined audiovisual conditions in cingulate\/medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, our results have allowed us to add a piece of evidence that the ventral frontal lobe and the cingulate cortex of primates may be involved in processing the association between a face or facial gesture and a vocal stimulus. This suggest that the PFC may be a precursor to the more complex functions of the human frontal lobe, where semantic meaning is linked with acoustic or visual symbols . \n\nMoreover, we observed specific activations in parts of the premotor regions (e.g., 6DC) and the primary motor cortex in response to intact marmoset vocalizations. These activations may reflect a preparatory response for orienting toward a vocalizing conspecific, which is essential for primate social interactions. This aligns with findings from Roy et al. , who demonstrated the premotor cortex\u2019s involvement both before and during self-initiated vocalizations when marmosets engaged in vocal exchanges with conspecifics. Notably, a subset of premotor cortex neurons was activated specifically by vocal production and not by other orofacial movements, such as licking. This suggests that the premotor cortex may either control specific muscles involved in vocal production, such as those in the larynx, or represent upstream control signals for initiating vocalization . Our fMRI findings suggest an anticipatory neural mechanism in marmosets, potentially oriented towards the source of vocalizing conspecifics. Such a mechanism could be crucial for appropriate social responses in a context-dependent manner. \n\nIt is important to note that, although not previously reported in macaques and humans, we show that the rostral cingulate area 32 participates in the integration of visual and auditory stimuli. Interestingly, only the posterior portion of this area responded exclusively to multisensory stimulation. In contrast, the anterior portion was\u00a0activated solely in response to auditory cues. The intervening region displayed activation in both auditory and combined audiovisual conditions. Nevertheless, these findings held true only for intact, coherent stimuli and not for the scrambled, incoherent versions. Reser et al.  provide an important anatomical context to these findings. They observed that the marmoset RT area, part of the core auditory network, has direct projections to a region considered part of area 32. This anatomical connection might contribute to the role of area 32 in auditory cognition, as seen in our study. This underscores the complexity of the involvement of this area in processing auditory and audiovisual social cues. \n\nWhile similarities exist in the neural networks processing multisensory stimuli between intact and scrambled conditions, the activations elicited by intact audiovisual stimuli were more pronounced and extensive, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, compared to their scrambled counterparts. This difference was less marked in the parietal cortex. Directly comparing the two conditions, we observed that intact audiovisual stimuli elicited greater activations across the occipito-temporal axis, within the prefrontal cortex, and notably in the rostral cingulate area 32. Subcortically, the\u00a0SC, pulvinar and amygdala were also more activated in response to intact audiovisual condition. The distinct activation patterns within area 32, particularly the differential responses between its posterior and anterior portions, suggest a specialized role in integrating coherent and congruent multisensory information. Specifically, the posterior portion of area 32, which exclusively responds to multisensory stimulation, appears to play a key role in processing complex sensory information, aiding in distinguishing meaningful audiovisual social interactions from nonsensical or mismatched stimuli. This aligns with findings in humans where the anterior ACC is implicated in processing context-dependent multimodal events . For instance, Laurienti et al.  observed increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex when auditory and visual stimuli were contextually congruent, as opposed to when they were mismatched. These observations highlight the advanced cognitive function of area 32 in marmosets, extending beyond basic sensory integration to encompass context and relevance in social communication. Such evidence suggests that the rostral anterior cingulate area 32 might serve as an integration center for context-dependent audiovisual information in social cognition, significantly influencing social interactions. \n\nFurthermore, the differential activation observed across temporal, prefrontal, and cingulate regions in response to intact versus scrambled conditions could reflect a sophisticated neural mechanism. This mechanism is capable of differentiating relevant audiovisual social information from nonsensical or mismatched stimuli, thereby enhancing the precision and efficacy of primate social communication. \n\nThe principle of superadditivity, in which multisensory responses exceed the sum of the linear additive responses to the unimodal stimuli, has been advocated by some researchers as a requirement for brain regions involved in multisensory integration . In line with this, we assessed the augmented responses to the audiovisual multimodal conditions in comparison to the sum of visual and auditory unimodal conditions, aiming to identify the regions exhibiting a superadditive effect. Our findings revealed that this augmented response was not merely a simple summation of unimodal stimuli, but rather a complex interplay of activation across temporal, parietal, cingulate, lateral, and medial prefrontal areas. This suggests a synergistic enhancement of sensory processing that goes beyond mere additive effects. Both visual and auditory areas also demonstrated significant differences between multimodal and unimodal stimulations, although the more pronounced differences in activations were situated in the temporal, parietal, and cingulate areas. Subcortically, structures such as the SC\u00a0, caudate, MGN, pulvinar, and amygdala exhibited a stronger response to the multisensory condition compared to the sum of unimodal conditions. The superadditive effect, especially pronounced in these areas, contributes to the efficiency and robustness of multisensory integration, enhancing the marmosets\u2019 ability to perceive, interpret, and respond to complex social cues. \n\nThese enhancements, transcending traditional models of sensory integration, resonate with the dynamic and context-sensitive neural mechanisms proposed by Ghazanfar and Schroeder  and Stein and Stanford . This intricate interplay between sensory modalities, particularly evident in social contexts, suggests a nuanced and perhaps evolutionarily conserved mechanism where the brain integrates complex social cues in a way that significantly enhances overall perceptual experience. This implies that the integration of social sensory information in marmosets, and potentially other primates, relies on sophisticated neural networks extending beyond mere sensory combination, playing a crucial role in the rapid and effective processing of social cues during communication . \n\nWhile our study focuses on the integration of audiovisual social cues, it is important to note that other forms of audiovisual integration likely involve different neural substrates. A recent meta-analysis summarizing 121 neuroimaging studies that examined the neural basis of audiovisual integration in humans, has demonstrated that the experimental context and stimulus complexity influence the brain networks identified during audiovisual integration . Their results suggest that audiovisual integration can occur via engaging a network of different brain regions at multiple levels which are highly context-dependent. These include sensory sites (i.e., middle and inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and the middle portion of superior temporal gyrus), subcortical sites (i.e., thalamus), and higher association sites (i.e., superior temporal cortex and middle and superior frontal gyrus). These studies indicate that the neural pathways for audiovisual integration appear to be flexible rather than a fixed network of brain regions, with superior temporal cortex playing a central role in these neural assemblies. Furthermore, in macaques and marmosets, audiovisual integration for object\/sound source localization has been shown to rely on distinct structures. Notably, the caudal subdivisions of auditory cortex and adjacent superior temporal polysensory areas have direct projections to the primary visual cortex. This architecture is hypothesized to enhance stimulus localization in peripheral spaces . Such distinctions underline the complexity and specificity of multisensory processing across different contexts. Our study, by detailing the neural correlates of social cues integration, not only enriches the understanding of multisensory processing but also opens avenues for exploring how diverse forms of audiovisual integration come together to influence our overall sensory perception. \n\nFurthermore, it is pertinent to address the nature of the stimuli used in our study, specifically the inclusion of negative facial expressions. Previous literature indicates that negative expressions tend to elicit more robust neural responses compared to neutral expressions in temporal, prefrontal, and subcortical areas in both humans and macaques, a pattern also observed in marmosets . Therefore, our findings, which focused on negative expressions, may not fully represent the neural processing associated with other types of facial expressions. Future studies exploring a broader range of emotional expressions in marmosets are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of emotional processing in a multisensory social context in this species. \n\nIn summary, our findings reveal a conserved audiovisual multisensory pathway in marmosets, characterized by the activation of face patches along the occipitotemporal axis and vocal patches in the auditory cortex, intricately linked with prefrontal and cingulate areas. These results suggests that during audiovisual social communication, marmosets recruit a more extensive neural network than what is engaged during the processing of visual and auditory signals alone, highlighting the evolutionary importance of integrating facial and vocal cues for interpreting social interactions . Given the marmosets\u2019 rich social behaviors, which parallel human traits such as prosocial behavior, imitation, and cooperative breeding, our study offers a valuable perspective on the evolution of complex social communication processes within primates. It addresses a critical gap in our comparative understanding of primate neurobiology, illuminating both the specialized multisensory processing in this species and the potential evolutionary mechanisms shared across primates in social communication. Therefore, these results not only enhance our knowledge of marmoset neurobiology but also underscore the species\u2019 potential as a model for translational research. This is particularly pertinent in the study of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions affecting social interaction, where marmosets may provide key insights . \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Common Marmoset subjects \n  \nAll experimental procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care policy and a protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Western Ontario Council on Animal Care #2021-111. We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal use. Ultra-high field fMRI data were collected from six awake common marmoset monkeys (  Callithrix jacchus  ): two females (weight 315 and 150\u2009g, age 44 months) and four males (weight 365\u2013459\u2009g, age 32\u201344 months). \n\nTo prevent head motion during MRI acquisition, animals were surgically implanted with an MR-compatible machined PEEK (polyetheretherketone) head post , conducted under anesthesia and aseptic conditions. During the surgical procedure (for details, see refs.  , the animals were first sedated and intubated to ensure they remained under gas anesthesia, maintained by a mixture of O  and isoflurane (0.5\u20133%). With their heads immobilized in a stereotactic apparatus, a machined PEEK head fixation post was positioned on the skull following a midline skin incision along the skull. This device was secured in place using a resin composite (Core-Flo DC Lite; Bisco). Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature were continuously monitored throughout the surgery. Two weeks post-surgery, the monkeys were acclimated to the head-fixation system and the MRI environment through a three-week training period in a mock scanner, as described in Gilbert et al. . \n\n\n### Multisensory facial expressions task and experimental setup \n  \nWe utilized six different types of stimuli derived from previously recorded videos . These videos originally depicted negative facial expressions. From these videos, we generated two video conditions, two audio conditions and two conditions involving both video and corresponding audio (Fig.\u00a0 ). We used custom video-editing software (iMovie, Apple Incorporated, CA) for this purpose. The two video conditions encompassed marmoset face videos with no sound and their scrambled versions. The two audio conditions consisted of vocalizations extracted from the videos and their scrambled counterparts. The final two conditions combined the videos and corresponding audio, and their scrambled versions. No vocalization filtering or background noise cancellation was implemented to maintain the integrity of the vocal features. \n\nAs in our previous study , we phase-scrambled the videos with a custom program, while vocalizations were time-domain scrambled . This preserved their spectral content over longer time periods but removed structure at shorter timescales, rendering the vocalizations unintelligible . \n\nEach condition was incorporated in a block design task, wherein each block of stimuli lasted twelve seconds, interleaved with a fifteen-second baseline block. During the baseline block, a 0.36\u00b0 circular black cue was displayed at the screen center against a gray background. Each run repeated the six conditions four times. To randomize the presentation of conditions in each run, we created eight different stimulus sets. These were counterbalanced within and between animals (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nDuring the scanning sessions, monkeys were placed in a horizontal MR scanner (9.4\u2009T) in a sphinx position within an MRI-compatible restraint system. Their heads were secured using a head post, and MRI-compatible auditory tubes were worn . After performing the head fixation steps, the MRI-compatible auditory tubes (S14, Sensimetrics, Gloucester, MA) were directly placed into the animals\u2019 ear canals bilaterally and were fixed using reusable sound-attenuating silicone earplugs (Amazon) and self-adhesive veterinary bandage (Fig.\u00a0 ) . \n\nAn MR-compatible camera (model 12M-i, MRC Systems GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was positioned to monitor the animal during acquisition. Horizontal and vertical eye movements were tracked at a frequency of 60\u2009Hz using a video eye tracker (ISCAN ETL-200 system, Boston, Massachusetts). Analysis of functional run data was performed using a custom R script. In each experimental condition and during baseline periods (i.e., fixation point in the center of the screen), the animals spent more than 79% of the time looking at the screen (baseline: 82.6%; marmoset face videos: 83.7%; vocalizations: 84.9%; marmoset face videos with vocalizations: 90.4%; scrambled marmoset face videos: 79.4%; scrambled vocalizations: 82.4%; scrambled marmoset face videos with corresponding scrambled vocalizations: 83.5%). Although a one-way ANOVA test indicated an effect of condition on viewing time (F(2.62,13.10)\u2009=\u20093.69,   p  \u2009=\u20090.044), this result was not robust after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (minimum adjusted   p  -value\u2009=\u20090.58). Consequently, any differences in fMRI activation between the conditions cannot be attributed to differences in exposure to the stimuli. \n\nVisual stimuli were projected onto a forward-facing plastic screen positioned 119\u2009cm from the animal\u2019s head using an LCSD-projector (Model VLP-FE40, Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) via a back-reflection on a first surface mirror. We used Keynote software (version 12.0, Apple Incorporated, CA) for stimulus display. The onset of each stimulus was synchronized with an MRI TTL pulse triggered by a python program running on a Raspberry Pi (model 3B\u2009+\u2009, Raspberry Pi Foundation, Cambridge, UK). The animals received a reward only before and after each scanning session, not during sessions. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and parameters \n  \nImaging was performed at the Center for Functional and Metabolic Mapping at the University of Western Ontario. Data was collected using a 9.4\u2009T\/31\u2009cm horizontal bore magnet and a Bruker BioSpec Avance III console running the Paravision-7 software package (Bruker BioSpin Corp). A custom-built gradient coil, with a 15\u2009cm inner diameter and maximum gradient strength of 1.5\u2009mT\/m\/A, coupled with eight separate receive channels was employed  (Fig.\u00a0 a,  ). \n\nEight functional images were acquired per animal over varying sessions, depending on each animal\u2019s compliance. We utilized a gradient-echo based single-shot echo-planar images (EPI) sequence, with parameters set as follows: TR\u2009=\u20093\u2009s, acquisition time TA\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009s, TE\u2009=\u200915\u2009ms, flip angle = 40\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200948\u2009mm, matrix size = 96\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, isotropic resolution of 0.5\u2009mm , 42 axial slices, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009400\u2009kHz, and a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2 (left-right). An additional set of EPIs, featuring an opposite phase-encoding direction (right-left), was collected for the EPI-distortion correction. \n\nTo diminish potential auditory stimuli masking by scanner noise, we employed a continuous acquisition paradigm that incorporated silent periods . Despite the continuous presentation of auditory stimuli during each 12-\u2009second stimulus block, the scanner noise level turned off for\u00a01.5-second periods within each 3-second TR. Consequently, we used a 3-second TR but collected\u00a0 all slices within 1.5\u2009s. \n\nIn each session per animal, we also acquired a T2-weighted structural image, with parameters set as follows: TR\u2009=\u20097\u2009s, TE\u2009=\u200952\u2009ms, field of view\u2009=\u200951.2\u2009\u00d7\u200951.2\u2009mm, resolution of 0.133\u2009\u00d7\u20090.133\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009mm, 45 axial slices, bandwidth\u2009=\u200950\u2009kHz, and a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nThe data was processed using AFNI  and FMRIB\/FSL  software packages. Initially, the raw functional images were converted into NifTI format using AFNI\u2019s dcm2nixx function, and then reoriented from the sphinx position using FSL\u2019s fslswapdim and fslorient functions. The functional images were despiked with AFNI\u2019s 3Ddespike function, and volume were registered to the middle volume of each time series using AFNI\u2019s 3dvolreg function. We stored the motion parameters from volume registration for later use with nuisance regression. Subsequently, functional images were smoothed using a full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel (FWHM) of 1.5\u2009mm with AFNI\u2019s 3dmerge function and bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 0.01\u2009Hz with AFNI\u2019s 3dBandpass function. For each run, an average functional image was calculated and linearly registered to the respective T2-weighted anatomical image of each animal using FSL\u2019s FLIRT function. For this process, the T2-weighted anatomical images were manually skull-stripped, and the mask of each animal was applied to the corresponding functional images. The transformation matrix obtained after the registration was used to transform the 4D time series data. \n\nLastly, the T2-weighted anatomical images were registered to the NIH marmoset brain atlas  via nonlinear registration using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs\u2019 ApplyTransforms function). \n\n\n### fMRI statistical analysis \n  \nWe employed the BLOCK function within AFNI\u2019s 3dDeconvolve tool to model the hemodynamic response for each condition. This approach uses a predefined canonical HRF shape, parameterized to match our experimental design with 12\u2009s stimulus blocks. These parameterized HRFs were used as regressors in a general linear model (GLM), complemented by polynomial detrending and motion parameters. This yielded six T-value maps per run for each subject, corresponding to our experimental conditions. These resultant regression coefficient maps were then registered to the NIH marmoset brain atlas template space  using the transformation matrices obtained with the registration of anatomical images on the template (see above). \n\nThese maps were then subject to group level comparison via paired t-tests using AFNI\u2019s 3dttest\u2009+\u2009+ function, resulting in Z-value maps. To protect against false positives and control for multiple comparisons, we applied a clustering method derived from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to the resultant z-test maps using the ClustSim option (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05). This method involves setting a cluster-forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 uncorrected, followed by applying a family-wise error (FWE) correction of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at the cluster-level. \n\nThese Z-value maps were displayed on fiducial maps obtained from the Connectome Workbench (v1.5.0, ) using the NIH marmoset brain template , and on coronal sections. The Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas  was used to define anatomical locations of cortical and subcortical regions. \n\nInitially, we identified voxels that exhibited significantly stronger activation during task engagement in each condition by contrasting each condition with the baseline period (i.e., marmoset face videos > baseline, scrambled marmoset face videos > baseline, vocalizations > baseline, scrambled vocalizations > baseline, marmoset face videos with vocalizations > baseline and scrambled marmoset face videos with scrambled vocalizations > baseline). To identify the areas involved in the processing of each modality (i.e., video, audio, and audiovisual conditions) and those common between modalities, we created a conjunction map between the three conditions, separately considering both intact and scrambled conditions. We used the AFNI 3dcalc-step function, inputting the thresholded resultant z-test maps obtained through paired t-tests (as described above). This allowed us to observe specific activations for each condition and the shared activations between conditions. Finally, to identify brain regions more activated by intact compared to scrambled stimuli, we contrasted the activations for marmoset face videos, vocalizations and marmoset face videos with corresponding vocalizations conditions against their scrambled versions (i.e., marmoset face videos > scrambled marmoset face videos, vocalizations > scrambled vocalizations, marmoset face videos with vocalizations > scrambled marmoset face videos with scrambled vocalizations). As previously, we also conducted a conjunction map between these three contrasts to observe specific and shared activations between the conditions. \n\nSubsequently, we investigated the superadditive effect to determine the voxels more activated by combined audiovisual stimulation compared to the summed responses of unimodal auditory and visual stimulations. This comparison involved contrasting the multisensory condition (i.e., faces with corresponding vocalizations) with the summed response of the unimodal conditions (i.e., face videos plus vocalizations). \n\nIn order to visualize the response levels under the different conditions, we extracted 68 cortical ROIs from each hemisphere based on the Paxinos parcellation  of the NIH marmoset brain atlas . These ROIs were categorized according to their cortical position: 9 ROIs corresponded to visual areas, 7 to ventrolateral prefrontal and orbital frontal areas, 6 to dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor areas, 9 to posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal areas, 8 to posterior parietal areas, 8 to lateral, inferior, and ventral temporal areas, 13 to auditory areas, and 8 to the insula and other regions in the lateral sulcus. Beta values for each condition and run were extracted from the resultant regression coefficient maps using AFNI\u2019s 3dmaskave function in each ROIs. Differences between conditions were computed using two-sided paired t-tests with\u00a0false discovery rate (FDR) post-hoc correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) using a custom-written Matlab script (R022a, The Mathworks). This analytical approach enabled us to conduct a detailed examination of response levels in specific cortical areas under the different auditory, visual, and audiovisual conditions. Additionally, within each ROIs, we computed the difference between the multisensory condition and the sum of the unisensory visual and auditory conditions to investigate the superadditive effect using two-sided paired t-tests (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10937914,"text_md5":"1ce28d8e7d76d6f9a1d8e73dfa0e853a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,58],"journal":[59,70],"publication_year":[72,76],"title":[87,172],"keywords":[186,229],"abstract":[242,1593],"body":[1602,70463]},"batch":1,"pmid":38480875,"doi":"10.1038\/s42003-024-06002-1","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10937914","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10937914"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10937914\">10937914<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10937914  Mapping of facial and vocal processing in common marmosets with ultra-high field fMRI"}

In these cases, the neural distribution of other cognitive functions is not fully understood. Although there is a bias towards a mirrored brain organization consistent with the Causal hypothesis, some individuals are found to be exceptions to this rule. However, no study has focused on what happens to the homologous language areas in the right frontal inferior cortex. Using an fMRI-adapted stop-signal task in a healthy non right-handed sample (50 typically lateralized and 36 atypically lateralized for language production), our results show that atypical lateralization is associated with a mirrored brain organization of the inhibitory control network in the left hemisphere: inferior frontal cortex, presupplementary motor area, and subthalamic nucleus. However, the individual analyses revealed a large number of cases with a noteworthy overlap in the inferior frontal gyrus, which shared both inhibitory and language functions. Further analyses showed that atypical lateralization was associated with stronger functional interhemispheric connectivity and larger corpus callosum. Importantly, we did not find task performance differences as a function of lateralization, but there was an association between atypical dominance in the inferior frontal cortex and higher scores on schizotypy and autistic spectrum traits, as well as worse performance on a reading accuracy test. Together, these results partially support the Causal hypothesis of hemispheric specialization and provide further evidence of the link between atypical hemispheric lateralization and increased interhemispheric transfer through the corpus callosum. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOne of the oldest findings in human neuroscience is that the brain control of language is lateralized to the left hemisphere ( ;  ;  ). However, not all individuals present a typical organization of this function. Some left-handers (22\u201324%) show an atypical lateralization of language \u2013 right or ambilateral ( ;  ;  ). Also, this atypical organization is observed in some neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, dyslexia, or autistic spectrum ( ;  ;  ). \n\nHow these atypical individuals organize the rest of their lateralized functions has been an extensively researched question. Historically, two different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the hemispheric specialization of the brain. The Causal hypothesis ( ;  ) argues that rapid activities requiring the implementation of sequences of cognitive processes are better performed from a single, unilateral control. As a result, these activities are innately programmed to be lateralized, and, according to this model, some functions will be performed better if they are controlled by different hemispheres. This evolutionary pressure engenders a complementary relationship between these lateralized functions. For example, language production predominantly lateralizes to the left hemisphere, while visuospatial attention typically favors the right hemisphere. As per the Causal hypothesis, if language were to atypically lateralize to the right hemisphere, visuospatial attention would, in turn, shift to the left hemisphere. The Statistical hypothesis ( ), on the other hand  ,   postulates that each cognitive function lateralizes independently from the others. In this view, the likelihood of encountering atypical hemispheric dominance is essentially a statistical phenomenon, with no inherent interrelationship between various lateralized functions. The evidence supporting each theory in left-handers is mixed. Some studies have obtained data favoring the Statistical hypothesis when analyzing language, visuospatial attention, and face processing ( ;  ;  ). Most investigations, however, have demonstrated a mirrored organization of praxis ( ;  ), visuospatial attention ( ;  ;  ), face recognition ( ;  ;  ), and emotional prosody ( ) in most individuals with atypical lateralization of language. Nonetheless, it should be noted that this reversed pattern is not observed in all atypical participants, and all the studies found specific cases in favor of both theories ( ). \n\nAll these studies have employed a production task to investigate language lateralization in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), classifying left-handed participants into typical and atypical groups. The rest of the lateralized cognitive functions have been examined using several tasks, but they all mainly depended on posterior parts of the brain. This may have limited the results, given that they were not dealing with directly homotopic functions, which would have been the most sensitive scenario to the proposed advantages of hemispheric specialization ( ;  ). To directly address the language production function, which is typically dependent on the left IFC, we would have to use a cognitive task that is typically dependent on the homotopic right IFC. According to previous literature, this function would be inhibitory control. Extensive results support the notion that stopping an ongoing response involves a rightward network that includes the IFC, presupplementary motor area (preSMA), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Thus, inhibitory control and language production together are the ideal candidates to investigate the Causal vs. Statistical disjunctive. But surprisingly, no investigation to date has analyzed this. \n\nWhat causes language function to typically or atypically lateralize also remains unclear. Left-handedness appears to be, at best, a predisposing factor ( ). In clinical populations, atypical lateralization of language has been found to be a defining characteristic among patients of dyslexia ( ), schizophrenia ( ), and autism spectrum disorders ( ). However, aside from exhibiting poorer language performance ( ;  ), no study to date has identified subclinical markers of these neurodevelopmental conditions among healthy individuals with atypical lateralization. Regarding the neural basis of language lateralization, the corpus callosum hypothesis ( )\u2014 which suggests that typical hemispheric specialization relies on the proper development of this structure \u2014 has garnered attention in recent years due to several noteworthy findings: (1) regional functional lateralization is directly linked to the size reduction of its interconnecting corpus callosum segments ( ); and (2) atypical lateralization of language has been associated with a larger corpus callosum and increased interhemispheric transfer at rest in language-relevant regions ( ). \n\nThe primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the lateralization of language production and inhibitory control. To achieve this, we divided non-right-handed participants into typically lateralized and atypically lateralized for language using the verb generation task. These two groups then completed the stop-signal task. In alignment with the predictions of the Causal hypothesis, we expected that: (1) the atypical group would exhibit a mirrored brain organization \u2014 particularly in the IFC, preSMA, and STN \u2014 during the stop-signal task; and (2) no individual would demonstrate lateralization of both language production and inhibitory control in the IFC of the same hemisphere. The secondary aim of this study was to explore certain potentially causal correlates of the lateralization of both functions. To test the presence of correlates supporting the corpus callosum hypothesis of lateralization, we analyzed the callosal volume and the interhemispheric functional connectivity at rest of the IFC, preSMA, and STN. To test the relation between atypical lateralization and several neurodevelopmental disorders (dyslexia, schizophrenia, and autism), we analyzed subclinical traits of these conditions among our healthy participants. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Inhibitory control shifts its lateralization according to language production \n  \nInhibitory control components during the stop-signal task were defined using four Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and subsequently analyzed through a MANOVA. This analysis included Hemisphere and Region as within-subject factors and Group (typical\/atypical) as a between-subject factor. Examination of the simple effects across each level of Region revealed that all the tested structures displayed a statistically significant Hemisphere \u00d7 Group interaction (pars opercularis   F  =25.59, p<0.001; pars triangularis   F  =19.95, p<0.001; preSMA   F  =7.63, p=0.028; STN   F  =14.24, p<0.001; p values Bonferroni-adjusted; see  ). In other words, depending on the lateralization group, all four regions appeared to exhibit a leftward (atypical group) or rightward (typical group) lateralization of their BOLD signal during the \u2018correct stop >correct go\u2019 condition of the stop-signal task. \n   Hemispheric lateralization of inhibitory control according to language lateralization.  \n(  a  ) ROI analysis of the main components of the inhibitory control network. Graphs depict adjusted mean BOLD signal during successful inhibitions on the stop-signal task (\u2018stop >go\u2019 contrast) for both hemispheres and both groups (n=50 typical and 36 atypical). All four structures showed significant Hemisphere \u00d7 Group interactions in a repeated-measures MANOVA (p<0.05).

VGT = verb generation task, SST = stop-signal task. \n  \nA voxel-wise whole-brain analysis of the functional asymmetry maps during the stop-signal task was performed to complement the ROI results. Two-sample   t  -test comparisons of the typical and atypical groups during the \u2018correct stop >correct go\u2019 condition showed a differential asymmetry pattern in all the ROI-corresponding areas, while also revealing differences in other cortical and subcortical regions, including the angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate ( ). Specifically, the typical group presented a rightward activity in these regions, whereas the atypical group exhibited a leftward shift ( ). \n\nFinally, the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the frontal LIs (pars opercularis + pars triangularis) from the verb generation task and the stop-signal task revealed a strong inverse correlation (  r   = \u22120.58; two-tailed p<0.001;   R  =0.34) ( ). Out of 50 typically lateralized for language, 33 (66%) presented a typical right lateralization for inhibitory control, and 17 (34%) showed an atypical (left \u2013 ambilateral) lateralization. Among the 36 individuals from the atypical group, only 8 (22.2%) presented a typical lateralization during the stop-signal task, whereas 28 (77.8%) showed an atypical lateralization. Importantly, no participant presented a leftward + leftward or rightward + rightward segregation pattern for language production and response inhibition. Strong segregation of both functions into different hemispheres was observed in 38 participants (44.2%). The remaining 48 individuals (55.8%) presented an ambilateral representation of one or both functions, with an important level of spatial overlap in their activations (see  ). In this ambilateral group, language production presented an overlap in 32.3% of its voxels in the left hemisphere, and in 58.6% of its voxels in the right hemisphere. Inhibitory control showed an overlap in 57.2% of its voxels in the left hemisphere, and in 22.8% of its voxels of the right hemisphere. \n   Correlation between the LIs of the verb generation and stop-signal tasks.  \n r   = \u22120.583, two-tailed p<0.001,   R  =0.339.

The green area corresponds to segregated individuals (both functions strongly lateralized), and the red area corresponds to integrated individuals (at least one function ambilaterally controlled). Numbers inside each quadrant denote the number of individuals (n) contained in it.

Volume in the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum was inversely related with language LI (respectively:   \u03c1   = \u22120.25, p=0.02;   \u03c1   = \u22120.26, p=0.02; and   \u03c1   = \u22120.25, p=0.02). However, only the callosal genu was found related with inhibition LI (  \u03c1  =0.25, p=0.02). That is, the volume of the callosal genu increased as functional organization of the IFC became more atypical, extending this effect to the whole corpus callosum when considering exclusively language lateralization. On the same line, ROI interhemispheric functional connectivity analyses at rest revealed that VMHC of the pars triangularis also increased as a function of inhibition LI (  \u03c1  =0.26, p=0.02), but a similar relation failed to be found for language LI (  \u03c1   = \u22120.12, p=0.3). No statistically significant linear relationships were found when exploring the VMHC of the pars opercularis, the preSMA, or the STN. It should be mentioned, however, that the association between VMHC of the STN and inhibition LI was close to significance (  \u03c1  =0.22, p=0.054). \n\nBehaviorally, performance (RT, SSRT, and accuracy) during the scanner stop-signal task did not correlate with language and inhibition LIs. Regarding the reading test, accuracy for word length and word familiarity were found correlated with both LIs (length and language:   \u03c1   = \u22120.24, p=0.03; length and inhibition:   \u03c1  =0.21, p=0.04; familiarity and language:   \u03c1   = \u22120.23, p=0.03; familiarity and inhibition:   \u03c1  =0.3, p=0.01). That is, an atypical organization was related with a higher rate of errors when reading long words and unfamiliar words. No significant correlations were found when exploring reading speed. SPQ score was found significantly related with inhibition LI (  \u03c1  =0.25, p=0.02), but it did not reach statistical significance when paired with language LI (  \u03c1   = \u22120.19, p=0.08). AQ, on the other hand, presented an association with language LI (  \u03c1   = \u22120.25, p=0.02) but not with inhibition LI (  \u03c1  =0.0.8, p=0.5). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study employed the stop-signal task to investigate brain areas involved in the inhibitory control function in two different groups of individuals: typically and atypically lateralized for language production. As expected, the atypical participants showed, as a group, a mirrored brain organization of the inhibitory control function compared to the typical group. This leftward organization affected the entire inhibitory control network, including the IFC, preSMA, and STN. However, some participants manifested a clear overlap in the control of language and inhibitory functions. Our results also demonstrate that atypical organization of language production is associated with an increased white matter volume of the corpus callosum, and that atypical lateralization of inhibitory control is related with a higher interhemispheric functional coupling of the IFC. Behaviorally, atypical lateralization was not associated with performance on the task, but an association existed with worse reading accuracy, and more schizotypy and autistic traits. \n\nOur first relevant result is that the group of individuals with atypical lateralization of language presented a mirrored brain organization during the stop-signal task compared to the typically lateralized group. Remarkably, the hemispheric asymmetry differences obtained affected the entire inhibitory control brain network ( ). The inferior frontal cortex, or IFC, associated with the initiation of the stop command and the main cortical area of this system, showed a clear lateralization effect, with the typical group almost exclusively using the right part and the atypical group mostly activating the left part. The presupplementary motor area, or pre-SMA, related to the implementation of the stop command, was more bilaterally involved in both groups, although atypicals activated the left part more and typicals activated the right part more. Importantly, the hemispheric reversal of organization also affected the subcortical structures participating in this network, namely the STN and thalamus. These structures displayed a lateralization pattern similar to the preSMA, with a more pronounced bilateral engagement but higher involvement of the right part in typicals and of the left part in atypicals. Thus, this is the first demonstration that an entire cerebral network controlling a cognitive function shows a completely flipped organization in an atypical population for language, which supports the Causal hypothesis of lateralization ( ;  ). Moreover, this result reveals that hemispheric lateralization goes beyond cerebral cortices, and even interhemispheric connectivity, through the corpus callosum, given that it also involves frontal-subcortical circuits. Additionally, the specificity of this result to the areas of the proposed network is another element that supports the relevance of this system in inhibitory control. \n\nIt should be noted that previous studies have demonstrated a significantly higher involvement of the left IFC during cognitive control tasks in bilingual individuals when compared to monolinguals ( ;  ). However, this could not be directly considered in the current study due to the limited number of monolinguals participants (n=8), which would not allow for statistically robust tests. So, we cannot rule out the possibility that bilingualism could be acting as an enabling mechanism among atypically lateralized participants for the shift of the inhibitory control network to the left hemisphere. Therefore, the findings of this study should be extrapolated to the monolingual population with caution. \n\nRemarkably, this pattern of reversed specialization for inhibitory control was observed in the absence of a relation between functional lateralization and performance differences during the \u2018go\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019 conditions. Even though the \u2018go\u2019 condition involves a lexical decision requiring language processing, and the \u2018stop\u2019 condition consists of inhibiting a linguistic process, the functional organization of the IFC during the tasks did not affect the response speed (RT and SSRT) or the \u2018go\u2019 accuracy in either case. Thus, brain organization for language and inhibition, as initially defined in our study, and cognitive efficiency are not directly related, based on our data. This finding is consistent with prior studies highlighting that: (1) a densely segregated functional organization, rather than a reversed organization, is linked to general ( ) and specific ( ) cognitive deficits; and (2) specific cognitive deficits appear to be confined to the domains of verbal and spatial skills ( ). \n\nImportantly, despite observing a complimentary relationship between language production and inhibitory control at the group level, not all the individuals presented a strong and segregated distribution of these two functions. The vast majority of hemispherically segregated individuals showed the typical segregation of language in the left hemisphere and inhibitory control in the right hemisphere, whereas only a low percentage displayed the opposite segregated organization. The rest, in agreement with similar reports on other functions ( ), lacked a clear hemispheric lateralization of language production, inhibitory control, or both. In all cases, this implied some level of overlapping or sharing of the same area of the inferior frontal cortex. Both the low ratio of atypical segregation and the high ratio of bilateral inhibitory control could be explained by the fact that typical right hemispheric functions (such as inhibition) seem to be more bilaterally represented than typical left functions (such as language;  ). Some conclusions can be extracted from this: (1) Although infrequent, a strong atypical segregation of the two functions is possible; (2) Our data have not revealed any case with a segregation of both frontal cognitive functions in the same hemisphere; and (3) A large percentage of participants with a strong left lateralization of language presented a bilateral control of inhibition, showing that a typical dominance for language does not imply a strongly lateralized organization of other cognitive functions. The existence of exceptions to the group pattern of mirrored brain organization requires us to use caution when interpreting these data as supporting the causal hypothesis. Although the negative correlation between the lateralization indexes during the verb generation task and the stop-signal task is strong at the group level, some individual data support the statistical hypothesis ( ) instead. Given that we found no cases of both cognitive functions completely sharing a hemisphere (see  ), we propose that causal-supporting vs. statistical-supporting results reflects two different pathways to cognitive control. On the one hand, the segregated pathway (in line with the Causal hypothesis) develops due to the cerebral bias towards lateralizing certain cognitive functions in a single hemisphere. On the other hand, the integrated pathway (in line with the Statistical hypothesis), appears when ontogenetic development towards strong lateralized control fails in some way. \n\nThese findings could have significant implications when studying neonatal lesions that facilitate the development of left-handedness ( ), or when assessing the consequences of brain lesions in the left-handed population ( ). For example, a left-sided lesion in an individual with rightward language lateralization may result in inhibitory control and social deficits ( ). It also raises questions about neuroplasticity, particularly how functional reorganization following a brain lesion (such as a left-to-right reorganization of language) would impact this hemispheric relationship between language and inhibitory control, and the cognitive consequences for inhibitory control after such a reorganization ( ). These results could also offer valuable insights for cognitive rehabilitation procedures in patients with psychiatric disorders that seem to be linked to a higher prevalence of left-handedness and alterations in language lateralization ( ). \n\nThe corpus callosum is the main cerebral structure in interhemispheric connectivity, with the genu area being responsible for the connectivity between the two inferior frontal gyri ( ). Phylogenetic data have demonstrated a negative association between the corpus callosum volume and hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the ontogenetic development of the brain is supported by a decrease in interhemispheric connectivity to potentiate and establish intrahemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization ( ). There is evidence of this mechanism in language development ( ) and in agenesis of the corpus callosum, which has been associated with lower lateralization of language and worse language performance ( ;  ). In line with this proposal, we have replicated the relation between callosal enlargement and atypical functional organization found in a previous study ( ). Moreover, in our data, this structural correlation was accompanied by an association between atypical lateralization of inhibitory control and strength of interhemispheric functional connectivity in the pars triangularis of the IFC. \n\nAs hypothesized, when considering the functional lateralization during both tasks, atypical organizations were found linearly related with higher scores on a schizotypy test (only for inhibitory control), higher scores on an autistic spectrum test (only for language production), and a higher rate of reading errors (both language production and inhibitory control). The first result is consistent with previous structural, functional, and behavioral data that have shown reduced language lateralization in schizophrenia patients ( ;  ). In the case of schizotypy, the evidence for reduced lateralization of cognitive functions is mixed and may respond to differences in the methodology employed ( ). However, consistently with the present results, this condition has been previously associated to impaired behavioral and neural processing during the stop-signal task ( ), and to an abnormal frontal functional asymmetry ( ). The second result relates atypical language lateralization with the presence of autistic traits, a result consistent with data obtained in autism ( ). The third result shows that atypical organization was related with a higher rate of reading errors when considering word length and word familiarity. The length effect has been considered a pathognomonic symptom of reading disorders such as developmental dyslexia ( ) and pure alexia ( ). These disorders have also been characterized by a weak language lateralization ( ). Thus, presented results support the hypothesis that atypical hemispheric specialization is related with worse cognitive performance in the linguistic domain, and even preclinical traits of some neurodevelopmental disorders among healthy population. \n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates a strong connection between the lateralization of language production in the IFC and the hemispheric specialization of the inhibitory control network. This functional interrelationship is apparent through both regional and voxel-wise analyses and impacts all the primary cerebral hubs of inhibitory control. Furthermore, the atypical lateralization of these two cognitive functions shows a linear correlation with increased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in the IFC, a larger corpus callosum, the presence of subclinical markers of schizotypy and autism, and decreased reading accuracy. Consequently, our research provides compelling evidence in support of the causal and corpus callosum hypotheses of lateralization among left-handers, and offers valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying atypical lateralization in healthy population. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEighty-six participants were included in the present study. They were selected following a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) language lateralization assessment via a verb generation task. Hence, 50 were typically lateralized for language \u2013 left-dominant \u2013 (mean \u00b1 SD age=22.4 \u00b1 3.6 years; 24 male, 26 female) and 36 were atypically lateralized (mean \u00b1 SD age=23.4 \u00b1 4 years; 16 male, 20 female). \n\nAll the participants were non-right-handed, according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ;  ). There were no significant between-group differences in age (  t  =1.28; p=0.2), sex (  \u03c7  =0.11; p=0.74), or general intelligence by WAIS-IV matrix reasoning subtest ( ;   t  =1.8; p=0.08). The participants had no history of any neurological or psychiatric disorders or head injury with loss of consciousness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants following a protocol approved by Universitat Jaume I. All methods were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines and regulations. \n\nRegarding their bilingual status, we found three categories: Spanish monolinguals (n=6 typical and 2 atypical), Spanish-Catalan bilinguals (n=27 typical and 23 atypical); and Spanish-Catalan passive bilinguals (n=17 typical and 11 atypical). Passive bilingualism refers to the fact that some residents of this region (Valencian Community) understand Spanish and Catalan, but their frequency of use of one language is extremely low when compared to the other. No significant between-group differences were found in bilingual status when comparing the typical and atypical groups (  \u03c7  =1.2; p=0.55). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nParticipants were recruited via multiple advertisements across Castell\u00f3n and Valencia universities (bulletin boards, mass emailing, etc.) asking for the collaboration of left-handers in an fMRI brain study. Persons older than 36 years or younger than 16 years were discarded. Valid participants were cited for a first fMRI session, in which they completed the verb generation task and the resting-state acquisition. During this session, we used the BrainWave software (GE HealthCare Technologies Inc) to visualize real-time data and roughly categorize participants as potentially typical or potentially atypical. Forty-three participants were found potentially atypical for language lateralization, and were invited to a second fMRI session, along with 43 potentially typical participants. During this second session, participants completed the stop-signal task (scanner) and a reading skill test (out of scanner). Also, data regarding schizotypy personality and autistic spectrum was gathered via self-questionnaires. Note that classification of participants as potentially typical or potentially atypical was used for screening purposes, and it did not completely match the final assessment. \n\n#### Verb generation task \n  \nExpressive language function was measured via fMRI during a computerized verb generation task ( ;  ) that consists of a two-block design paradigm with intercalating activation and control blocks. In the activation blocks, participants are asked to overtly say the first verb that comes to mind when visually presented with a concrete noun. In the control blocks, they have to read visually-presented letter pairs aloud. This task lasted for 6 min, with a block duration of 30 s (6 activation blocks and 6 control blocks), a stimulus duration of 1500 ms, and a blank inter-stimulus interval of 1500 ms. Before entering the scanner, participants practiced with a different version of the task for 1 min. Stimuli were presented using MRI-compatible goggles (VisuaStim Digital, Resonance Technology Inc), and responses were recorded with a noise-cancelling microphone (FOMRI III+, Optoacoustics Ltd.) to verify that each participant was engaged correctly in the task. \n\n\n#### Stop-signal task \n  \nResponse inhibition was measured via fMRI during a computerized stop-signal task adapted from another study ( ). The task consists of an event-related design paradigm with \u2018Go\u2019 and \u2018Stop\u2019 trials. In the \u2018Go\u2019 trials, participants are asked to manually answer by pressing a button if the visually presented string is a word (has a meaning) or a pseudoword (mimics typical word structure but has no meaning). Words require an index button press, whereas pseudowords require a thumb button press. However, on the \u2018Stop\u2019 trials, the string is followed by a \u2018beep\u2019 noise that signals to the participants to inhibit their response and refrain from pressing any button. The instructions emphasized the importance of going correctly and stopping correctly. However, participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible and avoid withholding their responses in anticipation of a possible \u2018beep\u2019. \n\nThis task took 13 min and 28 s, and it was divided into two runs that lasted 6 min and 14 s each, separated by a 1 min rest. Each run consisted of 135 trials, of which 32 (23.7%) were \u2018Stop\u2019 trials. All the trials randomly presented words or pseudowords. The trial structure consisted of a fixation crosshair (500ms), a word or pseudoword (1000ms, during which the \u2018beep\u2019 may or may not be presented at some point), and a blank inter-stimulus interval (ranging from 500 to 4000ms, sampled from an exponential distribution truncated at 4000ms, with mean of 1000ms). The Stop Signal Delay or SSD (the amount of time after the onset of the word or pseudoword when the \u2018beep\u2019 is presented during \u2018Stop\u2019 trials) changed dynamically during the task after each \u2018Stop\u2019 trial, depending on whether inhibition was successful (+25ms) or unsuccessful (\u221225ms), with a minimum of 100ms and a maximum of 800ms. The lower the SSD, the easier it is to inhibit the response, and vice versa. Hence, a dynamic SSD normalizes the task\u2019s difficulty across all participants based on their performance, aiming at a 50% successful inhibition rate. The SSD used for the first \u2018Stop\u2019 trial was estimated for each participant based on their practice session before entering the scanner. This practice session lasted 6 min and used a different set of words and pseudowords. Stimuli were presented using MRI-compatible goggles and headset (VisuaStim Digital, Resonance Technology Inc), and responses were recorded via an MRI-compatible response-grip (ResponseGrips, NordicNeuroLab). The \u2018beep\u2019 volume was kept at a comfortable level and was constant across participants. \n\n\n#### Resting-state \n  \nFunctional connectivity was measured via fMRI during a resting-state session ( ). In this paradigm, participants were presented with a fixation crosshair and instructed to just lie in the scanner with their eyes open and try not to sleep or think about anything in particular. This session lasted for 7 min. Seven participants did not complete this session due to time constraints, and they were subsequently removed from the functional connectivity analyses. It is important to highlight that the exclusion of these seven participants across all analyses does not notably impact the overall results. \n\n\n#### Behavioral measures \n  \nIndividual inhibition speed was estimated by calculating the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT;  ). SSRT was computed as the difference between the median reaction time (RT) on correct \u2018go\u2019 trials and the mean SSD on the stop-signal task. We chose to employ the median RT instead of the mean RT, in accordance with the approach used in the study from which we adapted our stop-signal task ( ). This choice was made for two specific reasons: (1) when working with RT, using the median helps reduce the impact of outlier responses during the task; and (2) using the median RT allowed our sample\u2019s SSRT to align more closely with a normal distribution. It should be noted that technical problems involving the MRI-compatible response-grip invalidated the SSD and RT data of four participants, and so their SSRT was estimated using the data from the practice session instead. This practice session, which lasted for 6 min, took place outside of the scanner in a different room, but using an identical set of response-grip. So, for these four participants, the resulting SSD and RT after those 6 min of practice was used for their SSRT calculation. \n\nReading skill was evaluated using the word reading subtest of the PROLEC-SE-R ( ), a battery that assesses reading processes in Spanish. Participants had to read four lists of words consisting, respectively, of short familiar words, long familiar words, short unfamiliar words, and long unfamiliar words. Responses were recorded with a microphone, and their accuracy and speed were subsequently measured by computing length (performance during short words \u2013 performance during long words) and familiarity (performance during familiar words \u2013 performance during unfamiliar words) indicators. \n\nSchizotypal traits were explored with the SPQ ( ), a preclinical self-report questionnaire modeled after DSM-III criteria ( ). This questionnaire evaluates schizotypy based on the three-dimensional model: disorganized traits, cognitive-perceptual traits, and interpersonal traits. For two participants, these data were not collected due to time constraints. \n\nAutistic spectrum traits were explored with the AQ ( ), a preclinical self-report questionnaire modeled after DSM-IV criteria ( ). This questionnaire evaluates autistic spectrum based on the \u2018triad\u2019 of impaired communication, impaired social skills, and a restricted and repetitive way of acting ( ), plus two sub-scales for imagination and attention to detail. For two participants, these data were not collected due to time constraints. \n\n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a 3T General Electric Signa Architect magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner using a 32-channel head coil. All slices were acquired in the sagittal plane. A 3D structural MRI was acquired for each subject using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR\/TE = 8.5\/3.3ms; flip angle = 12; matrix = 512 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 384; voxel size = 0.47 \u00d7 0.47 \u00d7 0.5). For the fMRI, a gradient-echo T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence was used in the acquisition of 150 functional volumes on the verb generation task (TR\/TE = 2500\/30ms; flip angle = 70; matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 30; voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4), and a different sequence was used in the acquisition of 374 functional volumes during the stop-signal task and 210 functional volumes in the resting-state (TR\/TE = 2000\/30ms; flip angle = 70; matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 27; voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4.5). \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \n#### Task-based fMRI processing \n  \nTask functional images were processed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (SPM12; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Preprocessing followed the default pipeline and included: (a) alignment of each participant\u2019s fMRI data to the AC\u2010PC plane by using the anatomical image; (b) head motion correction, where the functional images were realigned and resliced to fit the mean functional image; (c) co-registration of the anatomical image to the mean functional image; (d) re\u2010segmentation of the transformed anatomical image using a symmetric tissue probability map; (e) spatial normalization of the functional images to the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada) space with 3 mm  resolution; and (f) spatial smoothing (FWHM = 4 mm). \n\nThe general linear model for the verb generation task was defined for each participant by contrasting   activation \u2009>\u2009control blocks  . The general linear model for the stop-signal task was defined for each participant by contrasting   correct \u2018stop\u2019\u2009>\u2009correct \u2018go\u2019 trials  . For both tasks, the BOLD (Blood\u2010Oxygen\u2010Level\u2010Dependent) signal was estimated by convolving the task\u2019s block\/trial onsets with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Six motion realignment parameters extracted from head motion preprocessing were included as covariates of no interest, and a high\u2010pass filter (128 s) was applied to the contrast images to eliminate low\u2010frequency components. \n\nAfter that, we utilized the VOI analysis function within SPM12 to extract the first eigenvariate of the BOLD time courses from the stop-signal contrast images, which highly resembles the mean time course across the voxels. This extraction was carried out region-wise for the main components of the inhibitory control network: pars opercularis, pars triangularis, preSMA, and STN. Pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the IFC were defined following the criteria of the Harvard-Oxford atlas ( ;  ;  ;  ). For the PreSMA region, we used the SMA region, as defined by the same atlas, but including only voxels anterior to MNI Y=0 ( ). STN was defined by a 10 mm box centered at MNI coordinates 10,\u201315, \u22125 ( ;  ). \n\nLastly, we computed whole-brain voxel-wise functional asymmetry maps from the stop-signal contrast images. To do so, stop-signal contrast images were flipped at midline, inverting the right and left hemispheres, and subsequently subtracted from the original unflipped contrast images ( ). \n\n\n#### Resting-state fMRI processing \n  \nResting-state functional images were processed using the Data Processing Assistant for the Resting\u2010State toolbox (DPARSFA;  ), which is based on SPM and the Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging toolbox (DPABI;  ). Preprocessing steps included: (a) slice\u2010timing correction for interleaved acquisitions; (b) head motion correction (no participant had a head motion of more than 2 mm maximum displacement in any direction or 2\u00b0 of any angular motion throughout the scan); (c) co-registration of the anatomical image with the mean functional image; (d) new segmentation to DARTEL; (e) removal of nuisance variance through linear regression: six parameters from the head motion correction, white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, and global mean signal; (f) spatial normalization to the MNI (3 mm ); (g) spatial smoothing (FWHM = 4 mm); (h) removal of the linear trend in the time series; (i) band\u2010pass temporal filtering (0.01\u20130.1); (j) normalization to a symmetric template; (k) Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic Computation (VMHC) ( ), calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient of every voxel with its hemispheric counterpart; and (l) normalization of all voxel-wise time courses to Fisher   z   values. Finally, mean VMHC values were extracted for the pars opercularis, pars triangularis, preSMA, and STN. ROI definition can be found in the previous section. \n\n\n#### Structural MRI processing \n  \nStructural images were processed via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using the CAT12 toolbox ( ), which is based on SPM. Preprocessing steps followed the recommended pipeline and included: (a) segmentation into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid; (b) registration to the ICBM standard template; (c) modulated normalization of grey matter and white matter segments to the MNI template; (d) spatial smoothing (FWHM = 6 mm); and (e) extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs) values from native space. Three ROIs were delimited by the voxels mapped as genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum according to the Mori atlas ( ). Total intracranial volume was also extracted for use as covariate of no interest. \n\n\n\n### Individual assessment of functional lateralization \n  \nIndividual functional lateralization was assessed by calculating the Laterality Index (LI) on the unflipped contrast images ( ;  ). We used the bootstrap method implemented in the LI-toolbox ( ), based on SPM. LI is a proportion of the brain activation between the two hemispheres, thus giving us information about the direction and degree of hemispheric specialization during a particular function in a single individual. LI ranges from +1 (totally leftward function) to \u22121 (totally rightward function). For both the verb generation task and the stop-signal task, we explored the LI of the inferior frontal region roughly corresponding to the classic Broca\u2019s area: pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, according to the Harvard-Oxford atlas ( ;  ;  ;  ). This region is critical for both language production ( ) and response inhibition ( ), depending on the hemisphere. During the verb generation task, language production was classified as typically lateralized (LI higher than +0.4) or atypically lateralized (LI lower than +0.4). We used +0.4 as a cut-off point (contrary to the more traditional +0.2), based on previous findings that emphasized the importance of lateralization strength when grouping individuals ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### Task-based region-wise analysis \n  \nWe performed different analyses to investigate the hypothesis that the atypical group would show a mirrored brain organization during the stop-signal task. First, we conducted a region-wise analysis to compare the functional asymmetry of the primary components within the inhibitory control network between the typically and atypically lateralized groups. To achieve this, we employed a repeated-measures MANOVA, with Hemisphere (left\/right) and Region (pars opercularis\/pars triangularis\/preSMA\/STN) as within-subject factors and Group (typical\/atypical) as the between-subject factor. Subsequently, to assess potential hemispheric differences in any of these regions between both groups, we contrasted the simple effects of the Hemisphere \u00d7 Group interaction across the Region factor. All resulting   p  -values were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n#### Task-based voxel-wise analyses \n  \nPrevious analysis was complemented with whole-brain functional asymmetry contrast maps (extracted from the stop-signal task) that were compared in typically and atypically lateralized groups. To do so, we performed a whole-brain two-sample   t  -test (voxel-wise p<0.001; FWE cluster-corrected at p<0.05) via SPM12. \n\nWe also explored the functional overlap between both tasks in the subgroup of participants that presented an ambilateral organization of at least one function (n=48). To do so, we overlayed two one-sample   t  -tests restricted to the IFC: one for the stop-signal task (voxel-wise p<0.001; FWE cluster-corrected at p<0.05), and one for the verb generation task (voxel-wise p<0.05; uncorrected). Functional overlap was then expressed as the proportion of overlapped voxels for every function and hemisphere. \n\n\n#### Correlational analyses \n  \nThe relationship between the hemispheric specialization of the verb generation task and the stop-signal task at the IFC was also examined linearly. More precisely, we conducted a Pearson\u2019s correlation between the LI from the verb generation task and the LI from the stop-signal task used in the individual lateralization classification (p<0.05, two-tailed). \n\nUsing these LIs, we also tested if a linear relationship existed between the functional lateralization of an individual, and several behavioral tests and neuroanatomical measures. Partial Spearman\u2019s correlations were computed between the LI of both tasks and: stop-signal task performance (RT, accuracy, and SSRT), SPQ derived-scores, AQ derived-scores, reading test performance (length and familiarity effects on speed and accuracy), functional connectivity measures (VMHC), and white matter volume of the callosal genu. Age and general intelligence were included as covariates in all analyses. Total intracranial volume was also included as covariate in the volumetric analysis. \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10945575,"text_md5":"ccafb9ee1e272bcc63287592cb9876b9","field_positions":{"authors":[0,116],"journal":[117,122],"publication_year":[124,128],"title":[139,265],"keywords":[279,368],"abstract":[381,2177],"body":[2186,47594]},"batch":1,"pmid":38236206,"doi":"10.7554\/eLife.86797","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10945575","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10945575"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10945575\">10945575<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10945575  What happens to the inhibitory control functions of the right inferior frontal cortex when this area is dominant for language?"}

Here, we hypothesized that motor performance deficits in depressed patients would relate to basal functional coupling of the hand primary motor cortex (M1) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with the supplementary motor area (SMA). We performed a longitudinal, naturalistic study in BD, UD and matched healthy controls comprising of two resting-state functional MRI measurements five weeks apart and accompanying assessments of motor performance using a finger tapping task (FTT). A subject-specific seed-based analysis describing functional connectivity between PCC-SMA as well as M1-SMA was conducted. The basal relationships with motor performance were investigated using linear regression models and all measures were compared across groups. Performance in FTT was impaired in BD in comparison to HC in both sessions. Behavioral performance across groups correlated significantly with resting state functional coupling of PCC\u2013SMA, but not of M1-SMA regions. This relationship was partially reflected in a reduced PCC\u2013SMA connectivity in BD vs HC in the second session. Exploratory evaluation of large-scale networks coupling (SMN\u2013DMN) exhibited no correlation to motor performance. Our results shed new light on the association between the degree of disruption in the SMA\u2013PCC anticorrelation and the level of motor impairment in BD. \n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s00406-023-01671-1. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPsychomotor functioning involves processes that range from planning, initiating and executing movements [ ,  ]. Slower or inefficient information processing may derive from alterations in particular neural regions, or entire networks, that are essential to the circuitry [ \u2013 ]. The precentral gyrus contains the primary motor cortex (M1), which is in charge of starting the execution loop of movements of the contralateral limb [ ,  ]. For the coordinated adjustment of muscles implicated in the intended hand movement, the supplementary motor area (SMA) integrates signals of frontal planning with sensorial, proprioceptive and cognitive information from other brain regions and forwards it to the M1 [ \u2013 ]. Another pivotal region involved in successful motor responses is the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region belonging to the default mode network (DMN) [ ]. PCC plays a role in integrating signals from somatosensory areas and dorsal visual stream via parietal cortical areas for spatial processing and action in space [ ]. In stroke patients with impairments in motor performance, strengthened resting state functional connectivity between the M1 and the PCC was found to be critical for improvements in motor performance [ ]. This led us to hypothesize that disruptions in PCC connections might also be relevant for motor performance in other diseases that affect brain function, such as depression. Studies have shown that the PCC is also involved in emotional processing and rumination of negative thoughts [ \u2013 ], making it an relevant target of research in depression which, to our knowledge, has not been previously studied in this context. \n\nDeficits in psychomotor functioning is a typical symptom cluster of major depressive disorder and the depressive phase of bipolar disorder [ ,  ] and can make a decisive contribution to unsuccessful treatment [ ,  ] as well as to social functioning [ ]. In spite of their impact on patient outcomes, their manifestation is often assumed to be either part to residual symptoms or medication side effects, leaving their neural correlates and development of potentially targeted treatments poorly explored. The identification of more objective differences involving motor performance and its neural correlates in groups of bipolar depressed (BD), unipolar depressed (UD) patients and healthy controls (HC) could be a hint for developing novel biomarkers. Furthermore, such neurofunctional aberrations of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder can offer the chance to better understand the basis of motor symptom manifestation and treatment improvement [ ], for example, by applying more targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols [ ]. \n\nDifferent paradigms can be used to assess and compare the motor performance of patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, controls and recovered patients [ \u2013 ]. In the present study, we have chosen the finger-tapping-task (FTT) paradigm, considering that it dismisses working memory [ ,  ], which allows clearer conclusions about the movement process itself. It has been previously shown that motor performance in FTT is impaired in bipolar disorder [ ,  ], but not always in major depressive disorder, [ ,  \u2013 ]. This reinforces an importance of understanding the underlying brain mechanisms leading to such differences. In this sense, even comparable motor impairments in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder may be associated with differing neural correlates [ ]. In light of possible residual motor symptoms [ ,  ], the fundamental evaluation of motor performance, e.g. using the FTT, related to baseline M1 and PCC functional connectivity in depressed subjects undergoing treatment remains unexplored to our knowledge. Therefore, our aim with this study was to test whether resting state functional connectivity of M1 and PCC with SMA, which is accessible on the MRI scanner to all patients, regardless of how severely depressed they are, can explain behavioral differences in subjects. Functional connectivity between the right M1 and the SMA, an integrative center of the sensory motor network (SMN), can be a positive predictor of performance during the FTT in HC [ ]. Thus, baseline functional dysconnectivities with the SMA could potentially explain behavioral differences between BD and UD patients in contrast to HC. \n\nRecent studies have conceptualized the integration of the influences of affected neurotransmitters on subcortical-cortical loops as functional psychomotor brain units in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder among other mental disorders [ ,  \u2013 ]. This concept primarily focus on explaining psychomotor impairments at the behavioral level, but the link with objective measures of psychomotor function remains to be established. Studies that unveil the functional connectivity implicated in FTT can broaden our understanding from the perspective of motor performance deficits in depression [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In this regard, a connection between our regions of interest as critical part of the psychomotor system\u2014the PCC and the SMA\u2014is of particular interest and can contribute to the consolidation of this idea. \n\nThus, in the present investigation, we expect that FTT motor performance is impaired in BD and UD in relation to HC, a difference that could decrease after antidepressant treatment. The latter was addressed by longitudinal observation of treated patients. We hypothesize that the functional connectivity of M1 and PCC (our regions of interest for the seed-based analysis) with the SMA relates to FTT motor performance. Finally, we explore if the cross-correlation between the entire SMN and DMN (rather than the regions of interest) better explains differences in the level of motor performance, as a model involving the imbalance between the SMN and the DMN has been recently proposed to explain psychomotor deficits in affective disorders among others. [ ,  ,  ] \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Protocol \n  \nThe study was performed at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen (UMG) after approval of the research protocol by the local Ethics Committee. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all participants provided their verbal and written informed consent after a detailed explanation of the research protocol. Patients diagnosed by their psychiatrists with a depressive phase of major depressive disorder (UD group) or a depressive phase of bipolar disorder (BD group) (cf. ICD-10) and sex, age, and education matched HC (Table  ) were recruited by announcements at the local University, the UMG Psychiatric Center as well as the local Asklepios Psychiatric Hospital.   \nCharacteristics of the bipolar depression (BD), unipolar depression (UD), and healthy control (HC) groups \n  \n p  <0.05 are shown in bold \n\nChi-square\u00a0test \n\nOne-way\u00a0ANOVA with Brown-Forsythe correction for inhomogeneity of variance \n\nOne-way\u00a0ANOVA with homogeneity of variance \n\nAnalysis repeated without lefthanders \n\n BD   bipolar depressed,   BDI-II   \u2009Beck depression inventory-second edition,   HC   healthy controls,   MADRS   \u2009montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg\u00a0depression rating scale,   UD   \u2009unipolar depressed,   YMRS   Young\u00a0mania\u00a0rating\u00a0scale \n  \n\nAll participants were between 18 and 65\u00a0years old. Exclusion criteria were contraindications for MRI scans (i.e. pregnancy, metallic implants), strong visual impairment, neurological disorder, brain surgery or head trauma, current substance abuse, past or present psychiatric disorder for HC, and comorbid psychiatric diagnosis other than anxiety disorders for BD and UD. \n\nWe collected individual information about the handedness [ ] and being lefthanded was not an exclusion criterion in order to consider all the handedness variability in the clinical sample. And to consider the influence of this variable, we also complement the analyses with models excluding lefthanders. \n\nThe study comprised two assessments of two consecutive days separated by approximately 5 weeks (Fig.\u00a0 ). Between evaluations, patients received psychopharmacological treatment for the depressive episode at the psychiatric hospital by their caregiver physicians, who were independent in their treatment choices from the research group that conducted the study (naturalistic design). HC participated in the same study protocol, but received no treatment. All subjects were instructed to abstain from alcohol for at least 24 h before and to refrain from consuming nicotine or caffeine for at least two hours before the assessments. On each day the participants performed the FTT, on the second day followed by a structured interview led by a trained person and\u2014in case of medication with measurable blood metabolites (Supplementary Table 1)\u2014a blood sample was taken immediately prior to the MRI session to measure their blood medication levels.   \nMethods: (  A  ) Connectivity model between regions of interest: supplementary motor area (SMA) and right hemisphere hand primary motor cortex (M1) as part of the sensory motor network (red), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as part of the default mode network (blue), (  B  ) Study design: unipolar (UD), bipolar (BD) depressed and healthy control subjects (HC) performed the finger-tapping-task (FTT) on both days of both visits, FTTa and FTT b versions as described in methods section. The data of the second days was not used for the analysis of motor performance. The clinical assessment and the MRI sessions took place on one of the days. The blood sample was taken as close as possible before the MRI measurement, (  C  ) Seed definition technique: exemplification of the overlapping area (yellow) based on FreeSurfer individual segmentation of grey matter (green) and a spherical seed (red) at the MNI coordinates   x  \u00a0=\u00a040,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a020,   z  \u00a0=\u00a054 of functional coordinates for right hemisphere hand motor cortex (M1)  (D) and at   x  \u00a0=\u00a00   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212 53,   z  \u00a0=\u00a02 for the posterior cingulate cortex \n  \n\nSeverity of symptoms in patients was assessed with the Montgomery \u00c5sberg-Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Young\u00a0Mania\u00a0Rating\u00a0Scale (YMRS), and the Beck\u00a0Depression\u00a0Inventory-second version (BDI-II), the first two rated within the structured interview, the latter, self-rated. We used the BDI-II in all our groups as our primary scale to implement the degree of depressive symptomatology in the analyses. The BDI-II is well correlated with other-rated scales (MADRS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17)) and has a focus on cognitive aspects of depression and less on mood and anxiety or neurovegetative aspects [ ], which is in line with the research focus of this study. Furthermore, the BDI-II as a self-rated scale showed more correlation to brain metabolism in resting state positron emission tomography than HAMD as other-rated scale, indicating that BDI-II can be more strongly related to basal brain functioning [ ]. To account for the amount of psychotropic medication used per patient, an extended concept previously established as medication load [ \u2013 ] was implemented (Supplementary material, item 1.1). In addition, it was ensured post-hoc that the number of subjects taking neuroleptics, which are known for their motor side effects, was comparable (supplementary material, item 2.1). In HC, to verify the absence of potential psychiatric symptoms, the self-rated Symptom\u00a0Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) was used. \n\n\n### Finger-tapping-task \n  \nThe FTT was performed on a computer with an adapted keyboard that contained only the keys 1 to 4. Following previous research using the FTT [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ] the subjects tapped with the digits of the non-dominant hand not using the thumb. The task consisted of 12 intervals of 30 s duration in which the tapping was performed with intervals of 20 s without digit movements between them. The entire tapping sequence was presented on the computer monitor with numbers associated with digits: 1\u2009=\u2009little finger, 2\u2009=\u2009ring finger, 3\u2009=\u2009middle finger, 4\u2009=\u2009index finger. On the two days of the first visit the sequence \u201c4\u20131\u20133\u20132\u20134\u201d was used, on the two days of the second visit the sequence \u201c1\u20134-2\u20133\u20131\u201d was used (Fig.\u00a0 ). The participants were instructed to press the keys as fast and accurately as possible. No feedback was given on the performance of the task. The mean from the number of correctly tapped sequences of the last three of the 12 tapping intervals of the first days of the visits where used as a score to quantify the motor performance\u2014as they are expected to represent the performance plateau [ ,  ]. The number of correctly typed sequences accounts for speed and accuracy. [ ,  ] \n\n\n### Functional connectivity \n  \nThe functional and structural images were acquired with a 3T Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio, on Syngo VB-17a (Erlangen, Germany) and a 32-channel head coil. Structural whole-brain T1-weighted images were realized with a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time: 2250\u00a0ms, echo time: 3.26\u00a0ms, inversion time: 900\u00a0ms, flip angle: 9\u00b0, field of view: 256\u00a0mm, spatial resolution: 1 mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm, 176 slices, acquisition time: 8:26\u00a0min) and a resulting voxel size of 1\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm. \n\nResting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was measured with gradient echo EPI (echo planar imaging) sequence (repetition time: 2500\u00a0ms, echo time: 33\u00a0ms, flip angle 70\u00b0, multi-band-factor 3, field of view 210\u00a0mm, spatial resolution: 2 mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm, 60 slides with 2\u00a0mm thickness, distance factor 10%, 125 volumes (first 5 volumes deleted)) with a total acquisition time of 5:25\u00a0min, voxel size of 2 mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm and a slice orientation along the anterior\u2013posterior commissure. When measuring the rs-fMRI, participants were asked to keep their eyes open, fix their gaze on a fixation cross displayed on the screen, not sleep, and let their mind wander. \n\nBrain images were analyzed with SPM12 ( , Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, United Kingdom) based on MATLAB 2015b (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) The following preprocessing steps were performed: default temporal high-pass filtering SPM12, slice-time-correction, realignment with unwarping SPM12; spatial normalization with the deformation field from FreeSurfer Version 6.0 ( ) run on an Ubuntu 18.0 to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 brain at 2 mm spatial resolution; spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM); nuisance-regression of white matter and cerebral spinal fluid as well as motion correction with an automatized independent component analysis based cleaning procedure (ICA-AROMA v0.3-bet, available from:   [ ]. To ensure all autocorrelative signal was regressed out, a visual inspection of all data for quality control was performed. If potential noise artefacts remained, they were manually added as additional \u201cnoise\u201d components to the automatically identified by ICA-AROMA and the cleaning procedure was rerun. In addition to this extensive correction of movement we also assessed potential bias due to different extend of movement between the groups by comparing individual root mean squares based on frame-by-frame displacement of adjacent volumes in mm between the groups in an repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA). [ ] \n\nSeed-based analyses aimed to address functional connectivity differences and its influences on motor performance of the right hemisphere hand M1 and the PCC, especially to the SMA as the core region of our hypotheses. To define the M1 gray matter seeds, we combined the anatomical T1-weighted information from the precentral gyrus from FreeSurfer segmentation with a 7\u00a0mm radius spherical seed, defined using the SPM toolbox MarsBaR version 0.44 ( ), which was centered at the MNI-coordinates 40\u201320 54 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) for the right hemisphere hand M1 from a meta-analysis of functional MRI data of hand movement tasks [ ]. The overlap between these two sources was carefully inspected for consistency in every individual subject\u2019s data (see an example for precise coverage of the grey matter with a seed-based on this technique in Fig.\u00a0 ). To make sure that differences in functional connectivity did not stem from differences in the seed volume, we checked if the volume of the individualized masks differed between groups or time with an rmANOVA in SPSS (for results see Supplementary material, item 2.2). The subject-specific seed technique, as described for M1 seeds, was also applied to create seeds for the PCC (Fig.\u00a0 ) from an overlap of a sphere centered in the position of a previous study investigating motor impairments in stroke (MNI coordinates 0 \u2212\u00a053 26 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  )) [ ] and the individual FreeSurfer cortical segmentation. \n\nThe time courses of these seeds were bandpass filtered (0.01\u20130.1\u00a0Hz) before being included into a general linear model (GLM) in SPM12 for the first level analysis. According to the known task-positive and task-negative activations in the right hemisphere hand M1 and PCC respectively, we focused on brain regions positively correlated when seeding in the right hemisphere hand M1 and regions negatively correlated (anticorrelated) when seeding in the PCC. \n\nTo investigate potential full network interconnection deficiency between SMN and DMN in depressive patients, a group independent component analysis (gICA) was performed using MELODIC Version 3.14 in FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library,   [ ], to be able to estimate correlation between the time courses of these networks in all groups before and after intervention. The gICAs were performed for each group and each visit separately. Then, all the components were visually inspected to select the components representing SMN, anterior DMN and posterior DMN. The time course of the network signal from every subject was extracted separately for each selected component. For every subject a correlation coefficient for the correlation between the time courses of the SMN and the anterior DMN as well as for the correlation between the SMN and the posterior DMN was calculated using MATLAB 2015b (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe FTT was analyzed with an rmANOVA for motor performance in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26. In the main analysis no covariates were included, but to check for influencing effects, the analysis was repeated with the covariates sex, age, education, change of the medication load and change in BDI-II, which have the potential to influence the motor performance [ ,  \u2013 ]. Furthermore, models with only the patient groups were created to consider potential effects of years since first episode, age of onset, number of depressive episodes, change in MADRS and change in YMRS, which have been described in the literature [ ,  ]. The statistical threshold for the tests was set to two-tailed   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. If the assumption of homogeneity of variance was met for the ANOVAs, we used the Bonferroni post-hoc-test to correct for multiple testing. But if this assumption was not met, we used the Games-Howell post-hoc-test. \n\nFor the rs-fMRI data, a linear regression of seed-based functional connectivity and motor performance was calculated in SPM for the entire study sample at both visits. Additionally, accounting for dependence on longitudinal measures, two full factorial models were built in SPM with group and time as factors. The two models were created with and without medication load as a covariate-of-no-interest to control for possible differences arising from the medication load that the patients received. Additionally, a linear regression was performed for the entire study population at both visits in SPSS to test for a relationship between the SMN-DMN time course correlations and the motor performance. The SMN-DMN correlation coefficients were used for an rmANOVA model calculated in SPSS to investigate whether possible correlations between the networks differed between groups or time. \n\nIn regions belonging to our a priori hypothesis, we considered the statistical threshold at the cluster-wise correction level (  p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05) to reduce the probability of both false-positive and false-negative results. Otherwise, we considered the family-wise error correction level (  p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05) to reduce the probability of false-positive results. The labeling of functional imaging clusters was performed according to the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. [ ] \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFrom 95 participants, 11 were unable or unwilling to complete the entire study, one participant performed the FTT with the wrong hand and four participants were excluded due to abnormalities in the anatomical scans, e.g. intracranial epidermoid cysts. Therefore, data from 79 participants (31 HC, 27 UD, 21 BD\u201318 Type I, three Type II) were taken into final analysis. One participant from each of the HC and BD groups and two participants of the UD group were lefthanded. \n\n### Characterization of groups \n  \nThe mean time between the two visits was 4.9 weeks (SD 0.8). A complete evaluation of the characteristics between groups is presented in Table  . In line with our matching, the groups were comparable in terms of sex, age and years of education. The patient groups did not differ in terms of the history of their disease measured by age of onset, years since first episode and number of depressive episodes. The HC did not exceed the threshold of normality in the global severity index of the SCL-90-R score. \n\nThe severity of the depressive episode was evaluated during the study and at both visits the patient groups showed comparable depressive episode severity according to the BDI-II scores (Table  ). An rmANOVA with the BDI-II scores revealed a significant change between sessions and patient groups (factor \u201ctime F(1,76)\u2009=\u200915.660,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u20096.035,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u200941.138,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The comparison of the difference in BDI-II scores of visit 1 and 2 between groups revealed a significantly score reduction for UD compared to HC. \n\nIn MADRS, the severity of depressive symptoms was significantly higher in UD, but only at the first visit (Table  ). An rmANOVA with the MADRS scores revealed a significant reduction between visit 1 and 2 for both patient groups but stronger in UD than in BD (factor \u201ctime\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u200921.067,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u20095.179,   p  \u2009=\u20090.028; factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u20098.903,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005). There was a significant difference seen for YMRS scores with BD showing higher scores and a stronger reduction across time than UD in an rmANOVA (factor \u201ctime F(1,46)\u2009=\u200910.067,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003; interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u20097.024,   p  \u2009=\u20090.011; factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u20097.491,   p  \u2009=\u20090.009). \n\nAlthough only bipolar patients in the current depressive episode were recruited, the symptoms were mixed in some patients. At the first visit, three bipolar patients showed subclinical depressive symptoms (BDI-II score\u2009\u2264\u20098 and MADRS score\u2009\u2264\u200912), five showed manic symptoms (YMRS score\u2009>\u20099) and one showed both manic (YMRS score of this subject at visit 1\u2009=\u200914) and depressive (BDI-II score of this subject at visit 1\u2009=\u200953; MADRS score of this subject at visit 1\u2009=\u200928) symptoms. Even though being subclinical (  M  \u2009\u2264\u20099), the BD group showed a significantly higher YMRS score on visit 1 compared to the UD, as well as a greater change in YMRS score between the two visits. To confirm that the main results were not driven by the individuals with manic symptoms characteristics or subclinical depressive symptoms characteristics, we compared mean motor performance scores of the original BD group, with a subgroup of BD with clinical depressive symptoms only, which showed comparable values (BD visit 1\u2009=\u20098.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) (Fig.\u00a0 ); BD visit 1 with clinical depressive symptoms only: 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)). We also repeated the imaging analysis of linear regression of motor performance scores and functional connectivity of PCC seeds without the BD subjects showing manic, mixed or subclinical symptoms and the main results could still be identified.   \nMotor performance scores: Marginal means (mean number of correctly tapped sequences per 30 seconds) and confidence intervals from repeated-measures ANOVA of motor performance scores for healthy controls (HC, blue), unipolar (UD, pink) and bipolar (BD, green) patients. * =   p  \u00a0<\u00a00,05; The values displayed in the graph are HC visit 1\u00a0M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a012.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1, UD visit 1\u00a0M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD = 9.8 \u00b1 4.2, BD visit 1\u00a0M \u00b1 SD = 8.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6, HC visit 2\u00a0M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a014.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8, UD visit 2 M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD = 12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0, BD visit 2\u00a0M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD = 10.8 \u00b1 4.7. Significant differences are seen only between HC and BD (ANOVA factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(2,76)\u00a0=\u00a04.122;   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.020) with BD showing a significantly reduced number of correctly performed finger tapping trials compared to the HC (Post-hoc-test   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.023) \n  \n\nNo difference in medication load between patient groups was seen at visit 1 or visit 2, but the load in both visits was significantly different from zero, represented by the not medicated HC group. Furthermore, the change in medication load between visit 1 and 2 was small in the patient groups (Table  ) and not distinguishable from zero, represented by the HC group on an additional rmANOVA (factor \u201ctime\u201d F(1,76)\u2009=\u20092.431,   p  \u2009=\u20090.123; interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u20091.155,   p  \u2009=\u20090.320; factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u200948.226,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). For a detailed description of medication taken by the patient groups see item 2.1 in the Supplementary material. \n\n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe motor performance differed between groups (ANOVA factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u20094.122;   p  \u2009=\u20090.020; Fig.\u00a0 ) with BD showing a significantly reduced number of correctly performed finger tapping trials compared to the HC (Post-hoc-test   p  \u2009=\u20090.023). The UD group showed no performance impairment compared to HC (Post-hoc-test   p  \u2009=\u20090.158). The BD and UD showed no significant difference in motor performance (Post-hoc-test   p  \u2009=\u20091). \n\nAll groups showed an improvement of their motor performance in visit 2 (ANOVA factor \u201ctime\u201d F(1,76)\u2009=\u200933.800;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The improvement did not differ between the groups (interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(2,76)\u2009=\u20090.230;   p  \u2009=\u20090.795). \n\nBy including the covariates sex, age, education, change of medication load and change in BDI-II into the model, the difference in performance between the groups remains significantly different (factor \u201cgroup\u201d F(2,71)\u2009=\u20095.194;   p  \u2009=\u20090.008) as does the comparable performance improvement of the groups across the two visits (interaction \u201cgroup x time\u201d F(2,71)\u2009=\u20090.067; p\u2009=\u20090.935). However, the general effect of the performance improvement seen across the groups in visit 2 was not present anymore (factor \u201ctime\u201d F(1,71)\u2009=\u20090.002;   p  \u2009=\u20090.966). \n\nInfluences of covariates on the motor performance in general revealed a negative correlation with age (F(1,71)\u2009=\u200923.542;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and a positive correlation with education (F(1,71)\u2009=\u200916.183;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) for all groups. When limiting the ANOVA to the patient groups, motor performance did not differ between the groups (factor \u201cgroup\u201d; F(1,46)\u2009=\u20091.010;   p  \u2009=\u20090.320), but an improvement across visits was seen (factor \u201ctime\u201d F(1,46)\u2009=\u200923.042;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). However, it showed no interaction with groups (interaction \u201cgroup\u201d x \u201ctime\u201d, F(1,46)\u2009<\u20090.001;   p  \u2009=\u20090.999). These results were maintained, when including the covariates years since first episode, age of onset, number of depressive episodes, change in MADRS and change in YMRS. An older age of first episode (F(1,41)\u2009=\u20095.808;   p  \u2009=\u20090.021) and more years since first episode (F(1,41)\u2009=\u20094.396;   p  \u2009=\u20090.042) reduced the motor performance. An increase in YMRS score was positively correlated with a change in motor performance (interaction \u201ctime x deltaYMRS\u201d F(1,41)\u2009=\u20094.525;   p  \u2009=\u20090.039), a change in MADRS was not (interaction \u201ctime x deltaMADRS\u201d F(1,41)\u2009=\u20090.799;   p  \u2009=\u20090.377). The number of depressive episodes showed a negative correlation with change in performance (interaction \u201ctime\u00a0x\u00a0number of depressive episodes\u201d F(1,41)\u2009=\u20098.489;   p  \u2009=\u20090.006). \n\nAll results hold, when excluding the lefthanders from the analysis. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity \n  \n#### PCC seed-based functional connectivity \n  \nFor each group, the seed-based functional connectivity between the PCC and the SMA was visible as a negative correlation at   p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05 level, except for the BD group at visit 2. For BD, the connectivity between PCC and SMA was lower in contrast to HC, as well as to UD, at   p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05 level (Fig.\u00a0 ). No group differences in the functional PCC-SMA connectivity were observed at visit 1.   \nPCC connectivity differences: Resting state functional connectivity differences of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ANOVA \u201cmain effect\u201d contrast and pairwise differences in healthy controls, bipolar and unipolar depressed at the second visit (HC2, BD2, UD2,   p   FWEc\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as seem in an SPM12 full factorial model. HC2 showed higher connectivity measured by anticorrelation between the PCC and the bilateral SMA (red circle) than BD2. UD2 showed higher connectivity measured by anticorrelation between the PCC and the bilateral SMA (red circle) than BD2. Colorbar represents t-values \n  \n\nThe linear regression of the PCC-SMA functional connectivity and the motor performance scores from both visits and all groups together revealed a positive correlation (Fig.\u00a0 ). Due to the focus on regions anticorrelated with the PCC in the first level analysis, this means that the higher the performance the stronger the anticorrelated functional connectivity between PCC-SMA. When excluding the lefthanders from analysis the cluster in the SMA maintained at a level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected, but did not survive FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05 level anymore, most likely due to the reduced power by the lower number of subjects in the analysis.   \nPCC connectivity correlated with motor performance Resting state functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) linearly correlated with the motor performance in the finger-tapping-task (  p   FWEc <\u00a00.05). The motor performance of all participants is correlated with the connectivity (anticorrelation) strength between the PCC and the left supplementary motor area (SMA, red circle) as seen in an SPM12 linear regression model. Colorbar represents t-values \n  \n\nThis is in contrast to the seed-based connectivity between PCC and M1, were no negative correlation was identified at   p   FWE\u2009<\u2009  0.05   level in all groups and visits. Also, the linear regression of the PCC-M1 functional connectivity and the motor performance scores showed no linear relationship. \n\nTaken together and supporting the idea that lower PCC-SMA anticorrelation in BD is related to their behavioral impairment in the second session, a partial overlap in SMA is seen between the functional connectivity differences with other groups and the linear regression with motor performance (Fig.\u00a0 ). This indicates that part of the SMA in BD relates to both, the reduced performance in FTT and reduced functional connectivity to PCC, but not to M1.   \nPCC connectivity overlaps in the SMA: Resting state functional connectivity differences of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) between groups and connectivity of the PCC correlated with motor performance overlap in the supplementary motor area (SMA) at an axial plane (z  = 56,   p   FWEc\u00a0<\u00a00.05).   A   Healthy control subjects (HC2) show higher connectivity than the bipolar depressive subjects (BD2) at visit 2.   B   Unipolar depressive subjects (UD2) present higher connectivity than the bipolar depressive subjects (BD2) at visit 2.   C   The connectivity of the PCC to a part of the left SMA is correlated with the motor performance in the finger-tapping-task.   D   Connectivity clusters seen in (  A  , red), (  B  , blue) and (  C  , green) overlap in different extends of the SMA, as depicted in pink (A\u22c2B), located at medially in both hemispheres, in yellow (A\u22c2C), located anterior of the white area in the left hemisphere, in turquoise (B\u22c2C), located posterior to the white area in the left hemisphere, and in white (A\u22c2B\u22c2C), located in the left hemisphere between pink, yellow, and turquoise \n  \n\nPositive correlation to the PCC was evidenced for regions of the DMN, namely angular gyri, precuneus, cingulate gyri, and middle prefrontal regions (data not shown), confirming the PCC as a brain region associated with the DMN. \n\nLastly, all findings from the PCC seed-based analysis are sustained, when medication load is included in the full factorial models as a regressor-of-no-interest. \n\n\n#### M1 seed-based functional connectivity \n  \nThe positive functional connectivity between the right hemisphere hand M1 and the SMA could be shown at   p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05 for each of the groups. Additionally, other parts of the SMN, namely the pre- and postcentral gyrus bilaterally as well as bilateral temporal regions were identified. No negative correlation was evidenced at   p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05 (data not shown). \n\nThe linear regression of motor performance score and the right hemisphere hand M1-SMA functional connectivity from both visits and all groups together did not show SMA clusters that survived   p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05 correction, i.e. there was no correlation between the motor performance and functional connectivity between SMA and M1. This result remained when excluding the lefthanders from the model. \n\nA higher connectivity between the M1 and the SMA was seen in HC compared to UD only at visit 2 (  p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05) in the model where the medication load was inserted as regressor-of-no-interest. When excluding the lefthanders from the model with medication load as a regressor-of-no-interest, a higher connectivity between the right hemisphere hand M1 and the SMA was also seen at visit 1 at   p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05 threshold. \n\nCompared to UD, BD showed stronger connectivity between M1 and SMA on both visits (Fig.\u00a0 ). At the first visit, these clusters survived   p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05 correction. At the second visit, differences were more restricted and seen only in the left hemisphere at   p   FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05 level. These differences between BD and UD held in the model with medication load as a regressor-of-no-interest as well as in the model without lefthanders. There was no connectivity of the M1 that was stronger in UD than in BD.   \nM1 connectivity differences: Resting state functional connectivity differences of the right hemisphere hand motor area (M1) ANOVA \u201cmain effect\u201d contrast and pairwise differences between bipolar and unipolar depressed at first and second visits (BD, UD,   p   FWEc\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as seem in an SPM12 full factorial model. BD showed stronger connectivity than UD between M1 and the bilateral SMA (red circle) in visit 1 than in visit 2. No regions were evidenced in the UD>BD contrast. Colorbar represents t-values \n  \n\nChanges in right hemisphere hand M1-SMA connectivity over time were not evidenced in any of the 3 groups. Beyond our a priori hypothesis, higher connectivity of M1 with the left temporal middle gyrus was seen at visit 2 compared to visit 1 in BD (  p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05) in both models with and without medication load. However, the cluster was not sustained when excluding lefthanders from analysis. Other functional connectivity changes across time were not observed. Also, beyond our a priori hypotheses, higher connectivity was seen in HC than UD at visit 2 between the right hemisphere hand M1 and the right Rolandic operculum (  p   FWE\u2009<\u20090.05). When controlling for the medication load as a regressor-of-no-interest, the cluster at the right Rolandic operculum was not seen. Furthermore, the cluster was not present, when excluding the lefthanders from the analysis. There was no further difference between BD and HC in any of these models. \n\nFinally, to check for potential bias in the seed model, we evaluated whether differences in movement exists during the scanning sessions, in spite of applying a strict motion correction procedure in the analysis. When comparing the frame-by-frame displacement with root-mean-squares [ ] between the three groups, a difference was revealed, which do not seem to stem from a difference between the HC-BD groups (post-hoc   p  \u2009=\u20090.257), but rather from a trend between the UD-BD groups (post-hoc   p  \u2009=\u20090.062) (for detailed results see Supplementary material, item 2.3). \n\n\n\n### SMN-DMN correlation coefficients \n  \nThe correlation coefficients between SMN and DMN were computed and compared between groups and across time in rmANOVAs (for results see Supplementary material, item 2.4, Table 6). In the linear regressions, the motor performance scores neither showed a relationship with the correlation of SMN and posterior DMN (  r  \u2009=\u20090.002,   p  \u2009=\u20090.571), nor with the correlation of SMN and anterior DMN (  r  \u2009=\u20090.003,   p  \u2009=\u20090.361). Similar to the models with lefthanders, no linear relationship between SMN-DMN correlation and motor performance was seen. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study examined the neural underpinnings of motor performance between groups of BD, UD and HC participants with comparable sex, age, education, medication load and history of disease. We identified a deficit in the FTT motor performance only in BD in relation to HC, which decreased but remained significant after five weeks of psychopharmacotherapy. As expected, an association between the FTT motor performance and the negative functional connectivity between PCC and SMA was evidenced, which in the explorative investigation did not extend to the relationship between DMN\u2013SMN correlations. Contrary to our expectations, an association between FTT motor performance and positive functional connectivity between M1 and SMA was not observed, suggesting that the contribution of M1 is less relevant than that of PCC in this case. \n\nAlthough the motor circuit is one of the best described in the literature [ ], functional brain alterations in motor areas as part of depressive episodes remain poorly explored. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PCC\u2013SMA connectivity has been evaluated and identified as critical for motor performance in a study involving depressive and healthy subjects. In line with a former study showing the importance of the PCC\u2013SMA connectivity for upper limb motor tasks [ ], we were able to show here that this connectivity also appears critical for the FTT performance. Since functional connectivity between PCC\u2013SMA is linearly correlated with the FTT performance, which is impaired in BD compared to HC, one can assume that the functional brain difference between groups would explain the behavioral difference in the FTT. Despite these findings are promising for the identification of a brain-behavioral relationship, it must considered that such results do not survive multiple testing correction (FWEc\u2009<\u20090.05), when excluding the lefthanders. However, they remain identifiable at the threshold   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, which supports the notion of a drop in the power to detect statistical differences as cases decrease rather than left handed bias. \n\nPsychomotor alterations are commonly seen in bipolar disorder and sometimes in major depressive disorder compared to controls, which has been suggested as a factor that negatively contributes to treatment response or even remission [ ,  ]. Therefore, this remains a very relevant topic of research. In line with a former study comparing psychomotor performance in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and controls [ ], we report evidence that patients with bipolar disorder are more likely to have an impairment in motor performance measured by the FTT. This finding is also in line with the literature showing more robust FTT impairment in patients with bipolar disorder [ ,  ] than in patients with major depressive disorder, where it appears compromised only in some study samples [ ,  \u2013 ]. Overall, learning effects seem to be present from the first FTT assessment to the second, differently from previously shown [ ]. In a keyboard naive population from Kenya, it was seen that such learning effects only appeared in healthy controls and not in depressive subjects [ ]. A possible explanation for the improvement in the FTT performance could be that depressive patients in our study were able to profit from treatment, which may have reflected at least partially in their performance. This is an interesting hypothesis involving possible neuroplasticity changes that could be addressed in the future. \n\nThe hypothesis that the resting state functional connectivity between the M1 and the SMA is not only critical for the motor performance in HC [ ], but also in UD and BD, was rejected since the linear regressions with motor performance did not show correlated clusters in the SMA when seeding the right hemisphere hand M1. As far as we know, this work is the first providing evidence that right hemisphere hand M1-SMA connectivity is not critical for influencing FTT motor performance in depressive subjects. Another possibility for negative findings is that the seed method in Herszage et al  .   [ ] when detecting the functional representation of the hand with transcranial magnetic stimulation for each subject, could have been more precise. Since our method of seed determination includes not only functional but also individual anatomical information, it would be interesting to compare the two seeding methods in future studies to define the most promising way of detecting individual seeds. \n\nOur results show that BD have a higher M1-SMA connectivity than UD at both timepoints. Since we did not find behavioral differences in the FTT between the two patient groups, we can only hypothesize that the M1-SMA connectivity might have relevance for other symptoms of depression that were beyond the scope of this work. Groups, both BD and UD were comparably depressed, in a moderate level according to BDI-II scores, but only the UD improved significantly in the second evaluation, which might be a limitation when comparing the longitudinal changes during treatment. We speculate that residual psychomotor symptoms in BD, including the differences seen in neural correlates, may contribute for the limited improvement since psychomotor retardation is known as a negative predictor for antidepressant treatment response. [ ] \n\nAll individual seeds used for M1 and PCC functional connectivity analysis have been carefully created and inspected for structural accuracy of each individual anatomy aiming at the participant\u2019s hand knob. Furthermore, their volumes did not differ across groups, which per se could lead to false conclusions. Finally, we carefully controlled our main findings for medication load and movement during scanning sessions, where we found no evidence that our main findings might have been biased from these covariates. A trend difference of movement between groups should be kept in mind. To best remove potential bias stemming from movement, we used movement correction with ICA\u2013AROMA which was shown to be very efficient [ ] and extended it with manual checking for artificial signals, so we believe that our results from BD-UD comparison are not biased by movement. \n\nIn our view, our results also open new research perspectives for the comparisons between patient groups. For example, it may be interesting in the future to use motor paradigms that comprise a motor planning component, which may be more sensitive in detecting differences in behavior between UD and BD. This approach can be useful in new ways to support early differential diagnosis where there is a clear clinical need [ ]. Considering the PCC resting state connectivity in major depressive disorder, aberrations were shown as an early marker of depression [ ]. \n\nIt was postulated that the imbalance between the SMN and the DMN is critical for motor performance in depression [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, it might be expected that the interconnection between the SMN and DMN, as a task positive and a task negative network respectively [ ,  ], is critical for motor performance in the FTT. To explore whether this model could explain the motor performance differences in a more consistent way than our seed model would, we computed individual correlation coefficients between SMN and DMN. The idea that the SMN\u2013DMN connectivity is critical for FTT was rejected, since no linear relationship between correlation coefficients and the motor performance were revealed. It is possible that a model taking into account the imbalance between whole networks containing many regions is likely to oversimplify more complex neural mechanisms in this case. \n\nAnother postulated model for psychomotor processes consists of three units [ ]. First, the \u201cexternal unit\u201d, which receives exteroceptive influences from the environment and processes them into somatomotor outputs. Second, the \u201cinternal unit\u201d for interoceptive input and visceromotor output. Third, the \u201cassociative unit\u201d, which incorporates thought processes associatively into the processing. M1 and SMA could be assigned to the \u201cexternal unit\u201d and the PCC to the \u201cassociative unit\u201d respectively. [ ,  ,  ,  ] If so, the interconnection between these units could be seen as critical for motor performance and perhaps useful for the differentiation of UD and BD. In the recent literature, the SMN, to which SMA belongs, has been shown to be affected by subcortical-cortical connectivities with the thalamus, raphe nucleus and substantia Nigra in different phases of bipolar disorder [ ]. Even though out of the scope of our study, this realm may be investigated in future long-term longitudinal studies applying FFT in the same group of bipolar disorder to provide further insights into the phases of their disease. For example, this may help to elucidate whether PCC-SMA connectivity is a general or phase-specific characteristic of bipolar disorder, advancing our understanding of the neural correlates of psychomotor abnormalities in mania and depression. \n\nSome limitations need to be mentioned so that our results can be viewed with caution in certain circumstances. Our sample size is comparable to other studies, but likely modest taking into account the limited power in detecting differences when excluding the lefthanders. Therefore, a replication of our findings with larger samples is prudent [ ]. Another important aspect is the use of medication, which has been very tightly controlled, but still could have influenced the results in unpredictable ways. Probably due to fast switches in mood, not all BD were rated with depressive symptoms at a clinical threshold at the day of testing and some also showed a combination of depressive and manic symptoms (mixed episode). Thus, some heterogeneity can be seen as a limitation of this study, but, on the other hand, reflects clinical reality. Noteworthy, considering that BD can be often misdiagnosed as UD [ ], we observed the occurrence of manic symptoms in one patient part of the UD group, for whom the YMRS was in the clinical range. Nevertheless, all patients included in this study had a long history of disease and a diagnosis confirmed by multiple caregivers of the clinical setting, which reduces the risk of a BD being misdiagnosed as UD [ ,  ]. \n\nIn conclusion, our seed model supports the notion that functional connectivity between PCC-SMA explains the FTT performance in healthy and depressed individuals, but the functional connectivity between M1-SMA does not. Reinforcing the relevance and originality of these findings, the SMN-DMN correlation did not explain motor performance as the seed model. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary Information \n  \nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10995093,"text_md5":"21671667deb06973642eab2aa08f5dbc","field_positions":{"authors":[0,147],"journal":[148,181],"publication_year":[183,187],"title":[198,348],"keywords":[362,524],"abstract":[537,2193],"body":[2202,49982]},"batch":1,"pmid":37638997,"doi":"10.1007\/s00406-023-01671-1","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10995093","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10995093"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10995093\">10995093<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10995093  Motor performance and functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor cortex in bipolar and unipolar depression"}

The development of effective therapies relies on the precise mapping of the neural substrates causally involved in behaviour generation. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) performed during cognitive and neurological monitoring in awake surgery is currently considered the gold standard for the causal mapping of brain functions. However, DES is limited by the focal nature of the stimulation sites, hampering a real holistic exploration of human brain functions at the network level. \n\nWe used 4137 DES points derived from 612 glioma patients in combination with human connectome data\u2014resting-state functional MRI,   n   = 1000 and diffusion weighted imaging,   n   = 284\u2014to provide a multimodal description of the causal macroscale functional networks subtending 12 distinct behavioural domains. To probe the validity of our procedure, we (i) compared the network topographies of healthy and clinical populations; (ii) tested the predictive capacity of DES-derived networks; (iii) quantified the coupling between structural and functional connectivity; and (iv) built a multivariate model able to quantify single subject deviations from a normative population. Lastly, we probed the translational potential of DES-derived functional networks by testing their specificity and sensitivity in identifying critical neuromodulation targets and neural substrates associated with postoperative language deficits. \n\nThe combination of DES and human connectome data resulted in an average 29.4-fold increase in whole brain coverage compared to DES alone. DES-derived functional networks are predictive of future stimulation points (97.8% accuracy) and strongly supported by the anatomical connectivity of subcortical stimulations. We did not observe any significant topographical differences between the patients and the healthy population at both group and single subject level. Showcasing concrete clinical applications, we found that DES-derived functional networks overlap with effective neuromodulation targets across several functional domains, show a high degree of specificity when tested with the intracranial stimulation points of a different stimulation technique and can be used effectively to characterize postoperative behavioural deficits. \n\nThe integration of DES with the human connectome fundamentally advances the quality of the functional mapping provided by DES or functional imaging alone. DES-derived functional networks can reliably predict future stimulation points, have a strong correspondence with the underlying white matter and can be used for patient specific functional mapping. Possible applications range from psychiatry and neurology to neuropsychology, neurosurgery and neurorehabilitation. \n  \nColetta   et al.   integrate direct electrical stimulation performed during cognitive and neurological monitoring in awake surgery with human connectome data, opening a unique window into the intrinsic organization of the human brain and providing an unprecedented holistic exploration of brain functions. \n\nSee Elmalem   et al.

In all countries, these conditions are widespread and undertreated. \n\nNew therapies, including modulation of brain regions involved in healthy brain functioning and functional recovery, are a solid and promising prospect and an urgent clinical need.  Trials of both invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have targeted several brain regions, with little consensus on the optimal targets.  In line with this uncertainty, transcranial magnetic stimulation devices cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of psychiatric disorders were designed to target a spatially distributed set of brain regions.  The development of novel and effective\u2014both invasive and non-invasive\u2014neuromodulation therapies requires the acquisition of increasing amounts information about the cortical and subcortical neural substrates causally involved in different cognitive domains. \n\nA unique source of information that can help to address this question is direct electrical stimulation (DES), performed during cognitive and neurological monitoring in awake surgery. DES is currently considered the most reliable brain mapping strategy for identifying cortical and subcortical regions critical to functional preservation, as it has been shown to drastically improve the clinical outcome and the oncological history of patients with brain tumours.  Crucially, DES raises the unique possibility of obtaining probabilistic functional atlases with causal information regarding the spatial configuration of several brain networks, with important scientific and clinical consequences.  However, existing probabilistic DES-derived atlases are currently unable to provide such a mapping, as they are limited by the focal nature of the stimulation sites. Four recent studies tried to fill this gap by integrating DES with functional imaging.  One is a single case report that used stereotactic intracerebral EEG\u2014high temporal resolution but poor and incomplete brain coverage\u2014to characterize the network reconfiguration induced by a manic state, while two other studies identified language and motor related subnetwork components via functional MRI without recovering the unified network subtending the corresponding behavioural domain. Lastly, Elmalem and colleagues  were among the first to sketch a novel methodological framework able to integrate DES with connectome mapping. However, the authors limited their analysis to the medial wall and did not expand their analysis to include functional network properties. Taken together, this growing field of literature confirms the need for a robust procedure capable of establishing a causal link between focal electrical stimulation, behaviour, and the spatial arrangement of macro-scale functional networks of the human brain. \n\nRecent methodological developments allowed to link lesions in different brain locations to a common neuroanatomical substrate using the human connectome,  a detailed representation of how brain regions communicate with each other to form large-scale functional networks. In the present report, we seek to integrate the largest DES dataset ever collected in glioma patients with functional connectome mapping performed on a large normative population of 1000 healthy individuals, leveraging network hubs to build a multivariate normative model capable of quantifying single subject deviation from a reference population. In doing so, we propose to extend DES mapping toward the exploration of its network manifestation at the whole brain level and with single subject resolution, providing a viable solution to the need of causally driven brain maps for neuromodulation therapies and wide spectrum of clinical and surgical applications. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Datasets \n  \nWe used 2906 cortical and 1231 subcortical DES points derived from 592 low (WHO grade II) and 20 high grade (WHO grade III) glioma patients to provide a multimodal mapping of the networks underlying 12 functional domains. The 12 functional categories assessed during DES mapping were: verbal anomia, semantic and phonological paraphasia, non-verbal semantic association, motor and sensory responses, mentalizing, movement arrest, spatial perception, speech arrest, verbal apraxia and visual. Behavioural tasks and tumours distribution are described in the   (see the \u2018Neuropsychological testing\u2019 section and  , respectively). Mean patient age (min\u2013max: 38.1\u201340.8) was stable across functional categories, while the proportion of right handers (min\u2013max: 81.8\u201394.4%) and the male-to-female ratio (min\u2013max: 44.4\u201362%) showed a more pronounced variability ( ). Thirty-four patients had a preoperative functional MRI scan available (20 high- and 14 low-grade glioma patients).  For the purposes of the present report, cortical mapping refers to the grey matter electrically stimulated after craniotomy and before\/during tumour removal, while subcortical mapping refers to the white matter bundles and\/or caudate\/basal ganglia that was exposed at the depth of the surgical resection cavity. A number of the DES points (1091 cortical and 681 subcortical) used in this report have already been published, together with the description of the intraoperative mapping protocol (stimulation and neuropsychological tests, the same as used in the present report) and the data annotation procedure.  More details about the intraoperative mapping protocol, and pre- and post-processing data for the remaining DES points, can be found in the  . \n\nIn addition to the 34 patients with both DES and functional imaging available, we included the preoperative resting-state functional MRI scans of 32 (25 high- and 7 low-grade) glioma patients who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia (acquisition parameters and preprocessing strategy of the combined samples are reported in the   and a lesion loci map is presented in  ). The fully preprocessed resting-state functional MRI dataset used for deriving the DES-driven functional networks consisted of 1000 healthy subjects and was part of the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP) dataset. \n\nThe diffusion-weighted imaging dataset used for testing the coupling between cortical DES networks and subcortical stimulations points consisted of 284 healthy individuals (TractoInferno ). \n\n\n### Normative network construction \n  \nWe used lesion network mapping (LNM) and the GSP dataset to derive functional networks from the set of DES cortical points.  By using the lesions\u2019 locations associated with a certain syndrome to derive group representative functional connectivity maps obtained from a large cohort of healthy subjects, LNM leverages the spatial heterogeneity in lesion location to extract a common neural substrate associated with that syndrome. Similarly, we treated each cortical DES point as a transient lesion, using it as a seed to derive functional maps ( ). For each functional category, we obtained a single brain map expressing at each voxel location the percentage of DES-derived seeds with statistically significant functional connectivity separately for the positive (functionally correlated,  ) and negative (functionally anti-correlated) networks by using a non-parametric procedure [Randomise, as implemented in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) ]. To quantify the gain in brain coverage provided by the combination of DES and functional imaging, we compared the spatial extension of DES-derived networks in the grey matter with the coverage provided by a probabilistic model based on DES points alone ( ).  More details about LNM implementation can be found in the  . \n  \n Network construction from cortical direct electrical stimulation.   We used the direct electrical stimulation (DES) sites as seeds to derive functional maps at the group level using the functional connectome of 1000 healthy control subjects (  top two rows  ; phonological DES points used for building the example). Significance testing and thresholding is achieved via a non-parametric procedure (  third row  ). By aggregating binary connectivity maps for each category separately, it is possible to probe the spatial topography of causally-driven macro-scale functional networks of the human brain (  bottom row  ). L = left; R = right; T stat =   t  -statistic. \n    \n Comparison between a traditional probabilistic direct electrical stimulation atlas of brain functions and the integration of direct electrical stimulation with connectome mapping  . We used cortical direct electrical stimulation (DES) (  top row   for each functional category) to derive a probabilistic atlas of human brain function (  second row   for each functional category). Integrating DES with connectome mapping yielded functional networks with much richer spatial topographies (  third row   for each functional category), as illustrated in the comparison of the percentage of grey matter covered with the two procedures. Setting a high threshold on the functional networks derived from the integration of DES and connectome mapping reveals function specific network organizations (  bottom row   for each functional category). Am. Anomia = amodal anomia; L = left; Mov. Arrest = movement arrest; R = right; Spatial Perc. = spatial perception; stim. = stimulations; Verb. Apraxia = verbal apraxia. \n    \n Exceedance curves and accuracy values for the correctly classified direct electrical stimulation sites.   For each category, we repeated the network construction procedure by iteratively leaving out one direct electrical stimulation (DES) point. The left-out point not included in the network construction phase was used to contrast the DES positive against the DES negative network, reasoning that if functional connectivity is a proxy for a shared function, then the left-out point not included in the DES-derived networks should fall in a brain regions characterized by high positive functional connectivity and hence higher frequency for the DES positive network than for the negative network. Here, we described the frequency distribution in the DES positive network for the correctly classified left-out points, plotted as the probability of finding an unseen stimulation point (  y  -axis) above a certain network threshold (i.e. frequency) value (  x  -axis). The results suggest a clear distinction between functional categories centred on primary sensory regions and cognitively demanding functional categories relying on widely distributed functional networks, while the overall high accuracy values confirm the predictive capacity of our functional mapping. Am. Anomia = amodal anomia; Mov. Arrest = movement arrest; Spatial Perc. = spatial perception; Verb. Apraxia = verbal apraxia. \n  \n\n### Validation \n  \nWe implemented three different analyses to validate our approach. First, we computed the degree of similarity (via Pearson correlation, corrected for spatial autocorrelation)  between the group average DES-driven functional maps of the glioma patients and the group average DES-driven functional maps of the healthy population, leveraging the DES points and functional imaging scans of 34 patients with preoperative functional imaging available. We restricted the comparison to functional categories of clinical interest\u2014sensory-motor functions and language\u2014and with at least 10 stimulation points available. Following these criteria, the functional categories anomia (  n   = 22), speech arrest (  n   = 31), sensorial (  n   = 12) and motor (  n   = 30) were retained for further analysis. Further methodological details, together with an additional analysis, where we further split the glioma patients into high- and low-grade, are reported in the  . \n\nSecond, we tested whether DES-derived networks are predictive of future stimulation points via cross validation ( ). For each category, we repeated the network construction procedure by iteratively leaving one DES point out of the network building procedure, using it as a benchmark to test the predictive power of both the DES positive and negative derived functional networks estimated using all the other DES stimulations. The left-out point not included in the network construction phase was used to contrast the DES positive against the DES negative network, reasoning that if functional connectivity is a proxy for a shared function, then the left-out point not included in the DES-derived networks should fall in a brain region characterized by high positive functional connectivity and hence higher frequency for the DES positive network than for the negative network. Concretely, the left-out point was used to compute the mean concordance rate for the positive and negative network separately, and the DES network was classified as predictive if the average concordance rate for the positive network was greater than the average concordance rate of the negative network. In the  , we present additional analyses in which we tested the specificity and robustness of DES-derived networks, as well as the impact of repeated DES measurements within our patients\u2019 cohort in the network construction phase (  and \u2018Validation analyses\u2019 section, \u2018Repeated DES measurements of the same patient\u2019 subsection, respectively). \n\nLast, we used the TractoInferno dataset  to test whether DES-derived cortical networks are supported by the structural connectivity of the subcortical stimulations. Specifically, we first generated for each of the 284 subjects a functional category specific tractogram (i.e. 284 \u00d7 12 tractograms generated via constrained spherical deconvolution deterministic tractography). In a second step, we extracted the percentage of streamlines connecting each subcortical DES point to the corresponding DES positive and negative functional network, averaging across subjects to obtain the numbers reported in   (see the   for a detailed description). \n  \n Integration of subcortical direct electrical stimulation with functional mapping.

We also reported the percentage of reconstructed streamlines connecting the subcortical DES to the corresponding DES positive and negative functional networks, averaged across stimulation sites and subjects. Am. Anomia = amodal anomia; L = left; Mov. Arrest = movement arrest; R = right; Spatial Perc. = spatial perception; Verb. Apraxia = verbal apraxia. \n  \n\n### Single subject analysis \n  \nTo highlight the potential deployment of DES-derived networks in clinical practice, we implemented a multivariate outlier detection analysis able to quantify the adherence of the single subject functional organization to the mapping obtained at the group level (  and  ). As for the validation analysis, we initially restricted the computation to the same subset of 95 cortical DES points derived from the 34 patients with both DES and preoperative functional imaging available (see the \u2018Validation\u2019 section for more details). Next, we repeated the procedure to build a classifier specific for language and derived from stimulation points that fell\u2014for each category independently\u2014within hub territories of anomia, semantic and phonological. In this latter analysis, we also included the functional scans of the glioma patients that underwent surgery without DES mapping (final   n   = 66). The hub threshold was set at the 90th percentile of each functional category as per cross validation procedure (see the \u2018Validation\u2019 section). Cross validation (leave one out) was also performed on the healthy population to build a reference distribution. Hub points with a classification score above the median of the negative values of the reference population were labelled as strong outliers. In addition, we employed a non-parametric procedure to compare the distribution of the two samples. Of the 1000 healthy control subjects, we randomly selected 66 participants, repeating the procedure 100\u2005000 times (sampling with replacement). In each iteration, we performed a two sample   t  -test, comparing the randomly extracted 66 healthy subjects with the 66 patients and extracting the effect size (as per Cohen\u2019s   d  ) as the measure of interest (  and  ). \n  \n Illustration of the pipeline for single subject analysis and comparison between a clinical and reference population.   Leveraging direct electrical stimulation (DES) sites falling within core functional regions, it is possible to build a multivariate model able to distinguish between in- and outliers (  A   and   B  ), offering a tool to examine how the functional architecture at the single subject level relates to the functional architecture of a normative model (  C  ). fMRI = functional MRI. \n  \n\n### Clinical validation \n  \nTo corroborate the predictive analysis described in the \u2018Validation\u2019 section, we performed a mixed literature overview\/empirical analysis aimed at probing whether DES-derived networks can be used in combination with both invasive and non-invasive stimulation techniques or used to characterize the neural substrates of psychiatric disorders ( ,   and  , respectively). Lastly, we leveraged DES-derived networks to investigate the transient post-surgical behavioural deficits ( ). \n  \n Clinical validation of direct electrical stimulation-derived functional networks.   (  A  ) For each functional domain of interest, we superimposed the direct electrical stimulations (DESs) resulting in no behavioural disruption (blue, 241 stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) stimulations obtained) and DESs resulting in behavioural disruption (red, see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section) on top of the corresponding bipartite functional networks. As shown in the histograms, our analysis revealed that SEEG negative responses robustly co-localize with highly peripheral regions of the DES positive functional networks, highlighting their specificity. (  B  ) Brain regions subtending partial recovery from apraxia of speech, stroke induced aphasia and the post-stroke recovery of motor functions spatially overlap with the corresponding DES-derived networks\u2014but not with functional atlases based on DES alone (  right   to   left  ). (  C  ) DES positive but not DES negative networks contribute to the behavioural deficits observed in the language domain 1 week after surgery, as shown by the correlation between the importance of the surgically removed DES positive\/negative networks of phonological and semantic with the corresponding behavioural score for phonological and semantic fluency. AOS = apraxia of speech; DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; IFG = inferior frontal gyrus; L = left; R = right; rTMS = repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; TP = temporoparietal region. \n  \nOwing to the absence of negative DES responses (i.e. stimulations resulting in no behaviour disruption) in our dataset, we tested the specificity of DES-derived functional networks against the data of Elmalem and colleagues ( ).  In this study, the authors used 477 DES stimulations obtained via stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) from 37 patients in combination with normative data to investigate the connectional properties of the medial wall, recording the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) location of both DES positive (i.e. stimulations resulting in behaviour disruption) and DES negative (i.e. stimulations resulting in no behaviour disruption) responses. We focused on the latter ones, testing the DES negative responses against our DES-derived functional networks of motor, movement arrest, speech arrest and sensorial, i.e. the same four behavioural categories analysed by Elmalem   et al  .  After data inspection, we removed one duplicated stimulation point and one point due to no overlap with our grey matter mask, resulting in   n   = 241 stimulation points used for the analysis. We compared the distribution of DES negative responses in the DES positive and DES negative networks via Wilcoxon signed-rank test (as implemented in Scipy v1.7.3). \n\nTo probe whether DES-derived networks can be used to identify novel neuromodulation targets, we performed a qualitative literature overview. Two out of three identified studies investigated the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation for the recovery of language functions in apraxia of speech disorder ( , left panel)  and after a stroke ( , middle panel),  while the third identified study focused on the distinction between patients who exhibited natural recovery of motor function and patients who did not exhibit a recovery of motor functions after a stroke  ( , right panel). The set of targeted\/identified regions was quite diverse; left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for apraxia of speech; right inferior frontal gyrus, right and left temporoparietal regions for post-stroke recovery of language functions; and a wide distributed network for motor recovery. To visually probe the spatial correspondence between our mapping procedure and the results reported in the literature, we derived regions of interest from a set of different atlases. We extracted centre of gravity coordinates for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices from the Brainnetome atlas,  recently described as optimally suited for localizing transcranial magnetic stimulation targets in individual anatomical space.  Right and left inferior frontal regions were extracted from the AAL atlas v3,  while the temporoparietal region was defined directly in MNI space by hand by the first author (L.C.). The centres of gravity of the top 10 brain regions associated with the recovery of motor functions were extracted directly from the atlas  used in the corresponding study  by running Freesurfer\u2019s recon-all pipeline in MNI space. \n\nTo disentangle the contribution of DES positive and DES negative networks to postoperative neurosurgical deficits in the language domain, we retrospectively reanalysed the 42 patients described by Zigiotto   et al  .  For each patient in the dataset, we extracted the portion of his\/her surgical cavity belonging to either the DES positive or DES negative functional network (on the basis of the bipartite networks, for phonological and semantic separately). For each of these two masks, we computed the 90th percentile of the corresponding DES network and we correlated the two values\u2014one for the positive and one for the negative DES network\u2014with the phonological and semantic fluency scores obtained 1\u2005week after surgery. \n\n\n### Ethical statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the ethical committee of the APSS (Project: NeuSurPlan). All the data were collected according to the procedure approved by the Internal Review Boards and in agreement with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### From direct electrical stimulation points to macroscale functional networks \n  \nWe used 2906 cortical and 1231 subcortical DES points derived from 592 low (WHO grade II) and 20 high grade (WHO grade III) glioma patients in combination with LNM ( )  to provide multimodal mapping of the causal functional networks underlying 12 distinct functional domains\/categories ( , \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section and  ). By using the lesions\u2019 locations associated with a certain syndrome as seeds to derive group representative functional maps obtained from a large cohort of healthy subjects, LNM is able to leverage the spatial heterogeneity in lesions location to extract a common neural substrate associated with that syndrome.  Similarly, we treated each cortical stimulation point as a transient lesion and used it as a seed for performing a seed based analysis  in a normative connectome derived from 1000 healthy individuals (GSP dataset).  After binarization via a non-parametric procedure,  we aggregated DES driven functional maps to obtain the macroscale functional network subtending the functional category of interest, separately for the positive (i.e. functionally correlated;  ) and negative (i.e. functionally anti-correlated) networks. \n\nConcerning the spatial distribution of DES points, we found language related functional categories predominantly left lateralized, while mentalizing and spatial perception stimulation points were found more often in the right hemisphere ( ). Sensory-motor and motor planning networks (i.e. verbal apraxia, speech arrest and negative motor responses) showed an expected bi-hemispherical representation. The functional distribution of all the networks explored were concordant with the literature, including bi-hemispherical support previously described for language elaboration.  The combination of DES and functional imaging resulted in an average 29.4-fold increase in whole brain grey matter coverage compared to the state of the art probabilistic network building procedure provided by DES points alone,  with this quantity varying between 9.84 and 92.93, depending on the number of DES points of the functional category considered ( ). Of note, DES-derived networks are presented at two granularity levels\u2014i.e. two different frequency thresholds\u2014to show the existence of widespread and overlapping functional systems that nonetheless possess a high degree of specialization. \n\n\n### Probing the validity of direct electrical stimulation-derived networks at the group level \n  \nBy providing functional connectivity maps at the voxel level, seed based analysis allows regionally unconstrained mapping of whole brain connectivity and, combined with seeds derived from DES, it allows causal mapping of the spatial topography of putative large-scale functional networks subtending each tested functional category. To probe the soundness of our mapping procedure, we implemented a series of additional analyses. First, we computed the degree of similarity (via Pearson correlation, corrected for spatial autocorrelation)  between the group average DES driven functional maps of the glioma patients and the group average DES driven functional maps of the healthy population, leveraging the DES points and functional imaging scans of 34 patients with preoperative functional imaging available. Although modest in size, this dataset provides the unique opportunity to test the correspondence between DES and connectome mapping within the same individuals. Within this subset of patients, we restricted the comparison to functional categories of clinical interest\u2014sensory-motor functions and language\u2014and with at least 10 stimulation points available. Following these criteria, the functional categories anomia (  n   = 22), speech arrest (  n   = 31), sensorial (  n   = 12) and motor (  n   = 30) were retained for further analysis. We found that the group average DES driven functional maps of the glioma patients and group average DES driven functional maps of the healthy population did not differ for the subset of 95 DES points tested in the validation analysis, even after accounting for spatial autocorrelation (average Pearson   r   = 0.85, corrected   P  -values < 0.0001, 1000 surrogates per single DES point). Further methodological details, together with an additional analysis where we further split the glioma patients in high- and low-grade are reported in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section and in the  . \n\nSecond, we tested whether DES-derived networks are predictive of future stimulation points via cross validation (see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section for further details). Indeed, our analysis revealed that DES-positive networks are predictive of future stimulation points (97.8% accuracy). The median concordance rate for the left-out points\u2014computed across functional categories\u2014was much higher for the DES positive networks than for the DES negative networks (0.95 and 0.02, respectively, 25th and 75th percentile = 0.89 and 0.98 for DES positive and 0.01 and 0.06 for the DES negative networks, respectively). In  , we described the frequency distribution in the DES positive network for the correctly classified left-out points, plotted as the probability of finding an unseen stimulation point (  y  -axis) above a certain network threshold (i.e. frequency) value (  x  -axis), a so-called exceedance curve. Our analysis highlighted a clear difference between functional categories centred on primary sensory regions and cognitively demanding functional categories relying on widely distributed functional networks. \n\nLast, we used the TractoInferno  dataset to test whether DES-derived cortical networks are supported by the structural connectivity of the subcortical stimulations ( , top row). Probing the structural connectivity of subcortical DES points unveiled a tight coupling between structure and function, as subcortical DES points for a given functional category were found to preferentially connect to the corresponding DES positive network compared with the corresponding DES negative network ( ). \n\n\n### Probing the validity of direct electrical stimulation-derived networks at the single subject level \n  \nAlthough the integration of DES and connectome mapping yielded a robust and reliable mapping at the group level, it is not able to capture single subject deviations from a normative population, resulting unable to satisfy the critical need of a subject (or patient) specific functional mapping.  To fill this critical gap, we implemented a multivariate outlier detection analysis able to quantify the adherence of the single subject functional organization to the mapping obtained at the group level ( ). As for the validation analysis, we initially restricted the computation to the same subset of 95 cortical DES points derived from the 34 patients with both DES and preoperative functional imaging available (see the \u2018Validation\u2019 section for more details). Next, we repeated the procedure to build a classifier specific for language and derived from stimulation points that fell\u2014for each category independently\u2014within the networks hub territories of anomia, semantic and phonological. In this latter analysis we also included the functional scans of the glioma patients that underwent surgery without DES mapping (final   n   = 66, see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section and  ). The distribution of strongly deviant language hubs showed a prominent right skewed distribution in both clinical and normative populations ( , bottom row), with the vast majority of individuals with no or very few strongly deviant hub points and a small percentage of both patients and healthy subjects characterized by a strongly deviant network architecture. Our non-parametric analysis revealed that the two populations were characterized by Cohen\u2019s   d   \u2264 0.52 for 80% of the time, thus indicating small\/moderate differences in the functional architecture of the hub points ( ). In line with this result, none of the 95 DES points belonging to the subset of 34 patients with functional imaging available was classified as an outlier. \n\n\n### Clinical validation \n  \nAfter testing the methodological soundness of our mapping procedure, we performed a series of mixed literature overview\/empirical analysis aimed at highlighting potentially useful clinical applications. \n\nWe first tried to complement the predictive capacity of DES-derived networks by testing their specificity against 241 DES stimulations obtained via SEEG and not resulting in behaviour disruption. Importantly, the comparison with a different stimulation technique represents an important testing ground, as it probes the generalizability of our mapping procedure. As shown in the histograms presented in  , our analysis revealed that SEEG negative responses robustly co-localize with highly peripheral regions of DES positive functional networks. We also found a residual fraction of SEEG negative responses in prominent regions of the DES positive functional networks, likely driven by the overlap between the negative SEEG responses of Elmalem   et al  .  and the positive DES responses from our intraoperative testing, as illustrated in the 3D renderings of   contrasting DES positive (red) and SEEG negative points (blue) on the corresponding bipartite functional networks. Here we argue that this overlap is also partly obscuring another potential result, namely the higher prevalence of negative SEEG points in the DES negative network, as the comparison with the DES positive network is statistically significant for sensorial only (median in positive network = 0, median in negative network = 0.76,   t   = 12010,   P   < 0.05 as per Wilcoxon rank sum test). \n\nSecond, we performed a qualitative literature overview to probe whether DES-derived networks can be used to identify novel neuromodulation targets. We found that brain regions subtending partial recovery from apraxia of speech,  stroke induced aphasia  and the post stroke recovery of motor functions  spatially overlap with the corresponding DES-derived networks\u2014but not (or only minimally) with functional atlases based on DES alone (left, middle and right panels of  , respectively), highlighting the potential high degree of sensitivity of our mapping procedure. \n\nThird, we investigated a potential role of DES-derived networks in characterizing the transient postoperative deficits in the language domain by correlating the importance of the surgically removed DES positive\/negative networks of phonological and semantic with the corresponding behavioural postoperative score for phonological and semantic fluency. As shown in  , we found a strong negative correlation between the importance of the resected DES positive network for semantic and the semantic fluency score (the lower the score, the higher the impairment), while no relationship was found when we tested the DES negative network ( , left panel; Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = \u22120.61,   P   < 0.0001 and Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = 0.07,   P   = 0.7 for the DES positive and DES negative, respectively). Similarly, we observed a negative correlation between the importance of the resected DES positive network for phonological and the phonological fluency score and no correlation for DES negative network (Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = \u22120.35,   P   < 0.001 and Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = 0.07,   P   = 0.65, respectively). Of note, for the DES phonological network, we found six patients with a perfect bipartite surgical cavity (e.g. completely belonging to the DES positive or DES negative network). Removing those patients from the analysis did not significantly affect the results ( , right panel; Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = \u22120.35,   P   < 0.001 and Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = 0.24,   P   = 0.15 for the DES positive and DES negative network, respectively). Consequently, the scatter plots in   were generated without the six patients. \n\nLastly and as reported more in depth in the  , we found a moderate positive correlation between a summary metric reflecting the intensity of local spontaneous activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices\u2014key regions of the causal network subtending mentalizing ability\u2014and impairment in social behaviour in autism spectrum disorder patients (Spearman\u2019s   \u03c1   = 0.21 and 0.22, for the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, respectively,   P   < 0.02). \n\nTaken together, our preliminary results highlight the potential neuroscientific and clinical potential of our mapping procedure, as highlighted by the high degree of specificity and sensitivity in capturing both invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation targets. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present report, we propose a novel framework able to integrate DES and functional imaging, providing an unprecedented description of the networks associated with the stimulation sites of 12 distinct functional domains. Our results showed that the integration of DES and functional imaging results in a massive increase in brain coverage compared to the spatial distribution of the stimulation points only. Critically, we found that DES-derived networks are predictive of future stimulation points, confirming the causal nature of LNM applied to DES. Furthermore, we also assessed the validity of transferring DES points obtained from a set of patients to a healthy population by contrasting a large dataset of healthy individuals with a valuable dataset of patients where both DES mapping and functional imaging were available. Corroborating the soundness of our mapping, we found robust above-chance similarities in the averaged network representations of the normative population and the patients. We also implemented an additional proof-of-concept analysis in which we probed the coupling between structure and function by linking the subcortical stimulation points to the DES-derived networks. Underscoring the validity of our procedure, we found strong structural connectivity between subcortical stimulations points and DES positive functional networks. Lastly and to highlight the potential deployment of DES-derived networks in clinical practice, we leveraged the subset of individuals with both preoperative functional imaging data and DES points available to implement a multivariate normative model capable of quantifying single subject deviation from a reference population. Our analysis suggested that the functional architecture of this subset of patients\u2014tested at the single subject level\u2014is highly concordant with the normative population, a result that was further replicated by increasing the size of the clinical population and by using a language specific classifier. \n\nThe integration of DES and connectome mapping offers a unique window into the intrinsic organization of the brain, providing a real holistic exploration of human brain functions with important clinical and scientific consequences and advancing our understanding of the fundamental architectural principles of the human brain in two main directions. First, the integration of DES and connectome mapping yields mechanistic insights at the network level that cannot be achieved with DES or MR imaging alone, as highlighted by the prediction power of the DES-derived networks and the increase in brain coverage compared to the spatial distribution of the stimulation points only. Of note, the additional inclusion of structural connectivity further corroborated the specificity and biological plausibility of our results, as DES positive networks seemed to be characterized by a strong structural scaffold. \n\nThe second notable contribution of our work lies in the opportunity of quantifying the adherence of the single subject functional organization to the causal mapping obtained at the group level. While our results suggest a small\/moderate difference between patients and normative population in the functional architecture of hub points, thus strongly corroborating the soundness of our mapping, the informative value of the single subject analysis is not limited to the validation of a computational technique. Here, we propose the integration of DES and functional imaging, in combination with the single subject pipeline, as new disruptive tools able to delineate both invasive and non-invasive stimulation targets, breaking possible confirmation biases and expanding our exploration of the human brain. To further corroborate this latter point, in our clinical validation analysis we found that DES-derived functional networks overlap with effective neuromodulation targets across several functional domains, show a high degree of specificity when tested with the intracranial stimulation points of a different stimulation techniques and can be used effectively to characterize both postoperative behavioural deficits and neurodevelopmental disorders. \n\nMotivated by preliminary results showing that ablation of important DES positive but not DES negative network regions is strongly related to the behavioural deficits observed 1 week after the surgery, we argue that DES-derived networks can also play a critical role in surgery planning. For example, DES positive networks could be used in combination with the functional scan of a new patient to probe the single subject adherence to the maps obtained at the group level, identifying possibly deviant brain regions. In doing so, it would be possible to spare function specific network hubs from being resected when awake surgery and DES mapping are not possible, avoiding irreparable functional damage. Of note, the scope of possible applications is not limited to neurosurgery and neuromodulation but it is potentially much broader. We envisage possible application of DES-derived networks as novel tools to gain new insights on cognitive syndromes and specific cognitive impairment based on cortical-subcortical network disruption, or to explore and define brain plasticity mechanisms in pathological and healthy subjects. \n\nWhile our multimodal procedure delineates a robust framework able to provide a causal mapping of brain networks in the human brain, several limitations also exist. First, LNM allows causal inferences at the network level only and not at the level of single brain regions.  This is also true for hub regions, which, despite their critical role in defining the network, may or may not be critical for producing a certain behaviour. Second, it is not possible to combine networks in a causal way, as this would require stimulation points for all the possible network combinations, which is unfeasible given the obvious intraoperative time limitations. Third, the sample size of the clinical population was rather modest in size, limiting the explanatory power of the network topographies comparison between patients and the healthy population and both single subject clinical validation analyses. A larger clinical sample may be used to establish a link between deviant functional architecture and cognitive and\/or genetic factors and to replicate the preliminary results of our clinical validation. Last, DES mapping is intrinsically associated with selection and sampling biases and limited brain coverage. Stimulations are driven by the tumour\u2019s location, some brain areas are difficult to reach (e.g. the cerebellum) and the acquisition of negative stimulation data is often not implemented, as it requires reviewing\u2014if available\u2014every intraoperative video recordings multiple times. A more balanced acquisition of positive\/negative responses and a more comprehensive spatial coverage of the DES points may be used to redefine the networks, leading to more accurate functional maps. \n\nIn summary, the integration of DES with the human connectome fundamentally advances the quality of the functional mapping provided by either DES or functional imaging alone. DES-derived networks can reliably predict future stimulation points, have a strong correspondence with the underlying white matter and can be used for single subject specific functional mapping, with important consequences for neuromodulation therapies and preoperative neurosurgical planning. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10907080,"text_md5":"1023a506a165e7a20fd19d61312f37f6","field_positions":{"authors":[0,177],"journal":[178,183],"publication_year":[185,189],"title":[200,273],"keywords":[287,386],"abstract":[399,3633],"body":[3642,46976]},"batch":1,"pmid":38048613,"doi":"10.1093\/brain\/awad402","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10907080","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10907080"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10907080\">10907080<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10907080  Integrating direct electrical brain stimulation with the human connectome"}

Behavioral modifications, special education, and medicines are used to treat ASD; however, the effectiveness of the treatments depends on early diagnosis of the disorder.

Still, methods based on brain imaging could also be possible diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nTo identify the amount of information the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals on ASD, we reviewed 292 task-based fMRI studies on ASD individuals.

It affects many cognitive abilities of children and adults, such as social communication. There are methods to treat autism; however, the treatment would be more efficient if started at earlier ages. Accordingly, an early and reliable diagnosis is necessary. Among the several methods for diagnosing autism, brain imaging can be good because of its advantages, such as being non-invasive and trustworthy. In this study, we reviewed the task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to see if this imaging modality would help diagnose autism. The results of the work proved the hypothesis by demonstrating 73 brain structures to show a different activation between the individuals with autism and the average population. Future studies will benefit from our findings in diagnosing and predicting autism. \n\n\n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAutism is a cognitive impairment involved in a spectrum of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disabilities. It is characterized by possible difficulties, including impaired social interactions, significantly isolated living conditions, language difficulties, degraded face recognition, abject empathy, and constrained and repetitive behaviors, thoughts, and actions ( ). There are usual therapeutic methods used to treat ASD, such as multiple pharmacological treatments and target maladaptive co-occurring conditions, behavioral interventions, and advanced adaptive skills ( ); however, treatment is more successful if it begins in the earlier stages of the disease. Early diagnosis means an early intervention and treatment, showing the impacts earlier. The affected children benefit from this early treatment before they reach their maximum brain plasticity and neural development ( ;  ) controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the early start Denver model (ESDM). \n\nThere is no generally accepted diagnostic biomarker for autism ( ). A biomarker is a characteristic objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. The new biomarkers are expected to optimize or improve the current behavioral ASD diagnosis and early recognition of the pathological conditions; however, none of the ASD biomarkers has yet represented enough accuracy and specificity to be construed as clinical utility ( ). Accordingly, researchers have tried neuroimaging biomarkers to achieve an earlier diagnosis and enable earlier intervention ( ). \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method capable of identifying the pattern and extent of activity of brain areas during a cognitive function ( ). The popularity of fMRI is primarily due to its widespread availability, noninvasiveness, low cost, and appropriate spatial resolution ( ). It has shown many research applications, namely in studies relevant to imaging genetics ( ), addiction ( ), language ( ), memory ( ), emotion regulation ( ), motor function ( ), sensory function ( ), and vision ( ). In addition, numerous reports are available on the clinical applications of fMRI. Examples include depression ( ), bipolar disorder ( ), Alzheimer ( ), aging ( ), autism ( ), epilepsy (Klugah-Brown et al., 2018), and coma ( ). It is also used as a biomarker for various diseases ( ;  ;  ), to monitor a therapy ( ) or to study the pharmacological efficacy ( ). \n\nIn a literature review, we identified 18 studies that had reviewed the MRI studies on ASD. The studies were primarily focused on examining the findings on autism, aiming to improve the diagnosis accuracy. Among these studies, three articles were focused merely on the results of structural MRI in autism ( ;  ;  ), two articles reviewed resting state fMRI works ( ;  ), and among the 12 studies which examined the task-based fMRI studies on autism, 11 studies were old (more than six years ago) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and only five articles provided biomarkers for autism diagnosis. Except for one study ( ), none provided a map in which the fMRI findings on ASD were summarized. The study by Philip et al. ( ) is an excellent attempt to provide neuroimaging biomarkers for ASD. In this meta-analysis of 95 fMRI papers on ASD, six categories of cognitive functions were of interest: Motor, visual, executive, auditory, social, and complex cognition functions. Using the activation likelihood estimation algorithm, they provided maps in which the brain areas with higher and lower activation probabilities in the ASD group were compared to those of typically developing individuals. The maps and the primary brain areas of difference were provided for all the six groups of cognitive functions. \n\nIn using any diagnostic method for ASD, having access to the most reliable and frequent biomarkers is necessary. Accordingly, this study reviews the available task-based fMRI studies on ASD with the following objectives: Identify the cognitive functions that are mainly studied in ASD patients; evaluate the potentials of fMRI for ASD diagnosis; and identify the differences of fMRI maps between ASD and normal individuals as diagnostic biomarkers. A biomarker in this study is defined as a brain area that shows a different activation pattern in fMRI in the ASD group compared to expected. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nThe PubMed and Science Direct databases were searched to identify relevant studies with no date limitation. Different combinations (AND\/OR) of the following keywords were used for the search: \u201cFunctional MRI\u201d, \u201cbrain functionality\u201d, \u201ctask-based fMRI\u201d, \u201cbrain networks\u201d, autism spectrum\u201d, \u201cASD\u201d, \u201cPDD\u201d, \u201cpervasive developmental disorder\u201d, \u201cautistic\u201d, and \u201casperger\u201d. This search resulted in 651 papers. Due to the large number of studies in our initial search, a manual search of the references of the selected studies was not performed for missing documents. Our detailed search strategy is provided while registering for the study. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nThe title, abstract, and full text of the identified manuscripts (if needed) were studied to select the appropriate reports. The studies with the following conditions were initially excluded: Non-human studies; studies on diseases other than ASD or only on patients without average population; any imaging modality other than fMRI; and resting-state fMRI or functional\/effective connectivity analyses. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Published in a peer-reviewed journal; 2) Written in the English language; 3) A comparison between autistic and typically developed individuals using task-based fMRI; 3) Having a fully and clearly explained methodology, and 4) Reporting the brain areas with a different activation between the normal and ASD individuals in the considered fMRI stimulus. \n\nThese criteria resulted in 292 papers. The papers were categorized in terms of their evaluated cognitive function, and the number of documents in each category was as follows: Language=26; facial expression=21; attention=17; reward=17; theory of mind (TOM)=16; social cognition=15; face processing=13; eye gaze=13; emotion=13; social interaction=11; working memory=11; decision making=9; sensory processing=9; executive function=8; inhibition=8; visuospatial processing=8; face detection=7; location detection=7; response monitoring=7; body motion=7; imitation=6; social perception=5; pain=5; mirror neurons=4; learning=4; voice processing=4; temporal discounting=2; self-face processing=2; counting=1; restricted interests=1; object recognition=1; judgment=1; mentalizing=1; physical condition=1; cognitive flexibility=1; geometric reasoning=1; analogical reasoning=1; self-evaluative processing=1; change detection=1; deviance detection=1; novelty detection=1; empathy processing=1; spatial working memory=1; gesture expression=1; and mental rotation=1. \n\nGiven the high number of papers, we selected four categories of the stimulus types with the highest number of studies. As a result, facial expression, face processing, and face detection papers were regarded as category one (n=41), social cognition, social interaction, social perception, and theory of mind studies were considered as category two (n=47), language was category three (n=26), and attention was selected as category four (n=17). \n\n\n### Quality check \n  \nThe quality of the included studies was checked. In this process, each study was scored from 0 to 12, with a higher score showing a better quality. This assessment included questions on the following items: a) Case definition being adequate (score: 0, 1, 2); b) How much the patient group represented the community of ASD (score: 0, 1); c) How the control group participants were selected (score: 0, 1, 2); d) Adequate definition of the control group (score: 0, 1); e) How comparable were the patient and control groups regarding the statistical analysis (score: 0, 1, 2); f) How reliable were the imaging and neurocognitive instruments and task (score: 0, 1, 2); g) the patients and controls being assessed in a similar methodology (score: 0, 1); and h) How the non-participation rate of the study was (score: 0, 1). Based on this assessment and the scoring instructions, all the included papers received a score above 9. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe following information was extracted from each article: I) Study: Authors, journal, originality, study design, number of sessions, and any intervention; II) Participants: Inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of cases and controls, age, gender, and handedness; III) Data acquisition: Type of MRI machine and head coil, details of the imaging protocol, and the fMRI task; IV) Outcome measures: Number and name of the outcome measures, the analysis software, other tests; and V) Findings: Results, conclusion, and the suggested biomarkers. As provided in  , the primary information extracted from each study was the name of the brain areas that showed an altered (higher or lower) activation between the ASD and control groups during the cognitive tasks. \n  \nBrain areas which showed an altered activation between the autism spectrum disorder and normal individuals in the four cognitive functions of interest \n    \n\n### Data mapping \n  \nTo visualize the brain structures that showed an altered activation between the normal and ASD groups in the four cognitive functions of interest, we prepared two maps for each of the cognitive functions. The resulting eight maps are illustrated in  . The maps in warm colors show the brain areas with higher activation in the ASD group. In comparison, the maps with cool colors demonstrate the brain structures with lower activation in ASD individuals compared to normal subjects. The intensity of colors in each map is also proportional to the number of reports for each structure. In other words, the maps provided in   first illustrate the brain regions that showed a different activation between the ASD and normal individuals, and second, the brightness of the colors in the maps are in proportion to the number of reports on each region; a brighter yellow or a brighter blue shows that higher number of studies had reported changes in the activation of that particular brain area. \n  \nIllustration of the brain areas with an altered activation between the autism spectrum disorder and normal individuals in the four cognitive functions of interest \n\nNotes: Colors are proportional to the number of reports for each structure. Warm and cool colors respectively show the brain areas with a higher or lower activation in the autism spectrum disorder compared to normal individuals. \n  \nPreparing the maps was based on the methods of our previous study ( ;  ). Accordingly, a region of interest (ROI) was first created for each brain structure using the automated anatomical labeling atlas in the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. It was performed using the \u201cwfu pickatlas\u201d toolbox in the MATLAB software ( ). For structures whose ROI was unavailable in the automated anatomical labeling atlas, the creation and extraction of the ROIs were performed using the \u201cFreeview\u201d toolbox of the \u201cFreesurfer\u201d package software, version 5.3a). The global brain measures and the total lobar volumes from these maps were excluded better to understand the single brain areas with an altered activation. Next, the ROIs were added together to make a map, using codes written in the \u201cSPM12\u201d toolbox in the MATLAB software, version R2016a.v9.0) which showed the brain areas with lower or higher activation in the ASD group in any of those cognitive functions. As stated above, the intensity of colors here was proportional to the number of reports for each brain structure. The resulting maps are illustrated in  . \n\nIn addition to the maps which showed the areas of the brain with an altered activation, we identified the ratio of the grey matter of the brain that is showing a functional change in the ASD group. In other words, the aim was to estimate and illustrate the amount of overlap between the grey matter tissue of the brain and the brain areas with an altered activation in fMRI. First, the normalization of the ROI maps of   to the MNI space was performed. Next, the MNI atlas (Montreal Neurologic Institute; MNI152 template) was segmented into its different tissue types, including grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and three other tissue types, using the \u201cSegment\u201d toolbox in \u201cSPM12\u201d. Finally, using a code in MATLAB, the number of voxels in the brain function maps which had an overlap with the grey matter tissue of the brain was counted and reported in proportion to the total number of voxels in the GM map. Hence, a ratio was estimated that illustrated the portion of the GM tissue of the brain which showed an altered activation in the cognitive functions of interest. These maps are illustrated in  . \n  \nThe overlap of the brain areas with an altered activation between the autism spectrum disorder and normal individuals in the four cognitive functions of interest with the grey matter tissue of the brain \n\nNotes: a) The combination of the maps of the four cognitive functions, b) Social tasks-low, c) Social tasks-high, d) Face processing-low, e) Face processing-high, f) Language tasks-low, g) language tasks-high, h) Attention tasks-low, i) attention-tasks-high \n\nThe percentages show each map\u2019s overlap with the brain\u2019s grey matter tissue. \n  \n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### Summary of the included studies \n  \nThere were 131 case-control studies in the four selected cognitive functions. A total of 2953 patients and 2799 typically developing individuals were evaluated. Of this population, around 86% were male and 35% of the studies included only male participants. Regarding the MRI machine, 73% of the studies used a 3 Tesla MRI scanner, and the rest used 1.5T, along with using 8, 12, or 32-channel head coils. \n\nAround 79% of the studies were performed in one session. Other studies used 2, 3, 4, or even 5 sessions. The sessions involved preparation, MRI scanning, neurocognitive assessments, behavioral testing, and treatments and interventions. Only 3% of the studies had an intervention, including intranasal administration of oxytocin, pivotal response treatment, taking medications, and visualizing and verbalizing for language comprehension and thinking. \n\nThere were different criteria in the studies for the inclusion of patients, such as receiving a diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome from an independent clinician based on standard criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition; the autism diagnostic observational schedule-generic; autism diagnostic interview-revised; the social responsiveness scale; childhood autism rating scale; clinical impressions and experienced clinical judgment; and a series of clinical assessments that included a detailed developmental history, clinical interview and observation, medical workup, and cognitive testing. An IQ of 80 or above, measured by the Wechsler abbreviated intelligence scale, was necessary in some studies. The control groups were mainly composed of typically developing children or adolescents with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and they were matched with the patients in IQ, age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status of the family. \n\nA summary of the findings of the studies is provided in  . This table illustrates the brain areas with reports on a different activation between cases and controls in the four functions and the number of reports for each area. The areas with more than two reports on their different activation between the two groups are elaborated below in the order of their frequency of being reported. References of the selected 131 studies are provided as supplementary data. \n\n\n### Findings of the social tasks \n  \nA total of 30 brain areas showed a different activation between cases and controls during the processing of social tasks; 21 only showed lower activation in patients, 1 had a higher activation, and 8 areas had lower and higher reports. The brain areas with lower activation in patients were temporoparietal junction (n=13), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; n=12), superior temporal gyrus (STG; n=12), medial prefrontal (n=8), supplementary motor area (SMA; n=6), precuneus (n=6), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; n=6), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; n=6), inferior parietal lobule (n=5), anterior insula (n=5), caudate (n=4), cuneus (n=4), medial frontal (n=3), and insula (n=3). Post central gyrus (n=4) was the only brain structure with a higher activation in patients. \n\n\n### Findings of the face processing tasks \n  \nA total of 40 brain regions showed a different activation between cases and controls when processing faces. Sixteen areas only showed a lower activation, 7 areas demonstrated only a higher activation, and 17 areas showed lower and higher activation. The areas with a lower activation included fusiform (n=19), amygdala (n=19), STG (n=7), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC; n=6), occipital face area (n=5), IFG (n=5), inferior occipital (n=4), middle temporal gyrus (MTG; n=4), PCC (n=4), insula (n=4), middle frontal gyrus (MFG; n=3), cuneus (n=3), hippocampus (n=3), and ventral striatum (n=3). Higher activations in patients were observed in amygdala (n=6), pulvinar (n=4), thalamus (n=3), MFG (n=3), and precuneus (n=3). \n\n\n### Findings of the language tasks \n  \nA total of 48 brain regions showed a different activation level in the language tasks; meanwhile, 22 only had lower activation, 6 had higher, and 20 had higher and lower reports. The areas which showed a lower activation in patients in the language tasks were IFG (n=26), STG (n=11), cerebellum (n=9), MTG (n=8), fusiform (n=8), ACC (n=7), superior frontal gyrus (SFG; n=6), MFG (n=5), precentral gyrus (n=5), SMA (n=5), precuneus (n=5), cuneus (n=5), thalamus (n=5), occipito temporal gyrus (n=4), middle occipital gyrus (MOG; n=4), PCC (n=4), putamen (n=4), caudate (n=4), medial frontal gyrus (n=3), medial prefrontal gyrus (n=3), amygdala (n=3), and insula (n=3). The brain areas with a report on their higher activations in patients were STG (n=10), fusiform (n=8), MTG (n=5), IFG (n=4), MOG (n=4), posterior temporal gyrus (PTG; n=3), inferior parietal lobule (n=3), postcentral gyrus (n=3), and cuneus (n=3). \n\n\n### Findings of the attention tasks \n  \nA total of 39 regions showed differences in brain activations between the cases and controls; meanwhile, 14 areas were only lower in patients, 9 regions were only higher, and 16 areas had lower and higher reports. The areas with lower activation in patients were cerebellum (n=10), STG (n=9), IFG (n=6), precentral gyrus (n=6), SMA (n=6), postcentral gyrus (n=6), insula (n=6), MFG (n=4), medial prefrontal (n=4), superior parietal gyrus (SPG; n=4), putamen (n=4), thalamus (n=4), caudate (n=4), and orbitofrontal gyrus (n=3). The brain regions with higher activation in patients were medial prefrontal (n=7), precuneus (n=7), IFG (n=4), cerebellum (n=4), SMA (n=3), postcentral gyrus (n=3), and amygdala (n=3). \n\n\n### Overlap with the grey matter \n  \nAs mentioned above, this study aimed to determine whether fMRI can reveal considerable data on ASD. A positive answer to this question would introduce fMRI as a potential diagnostic tool for ASD in future works. Accordingly, we assessed the overlap of the brain maps obtained for the four cognitive functions (illustrated in  ) with the grey matter tissue of the brain, as explained in Materials and Methods.   shows these overlaps as well as the percentage of the overlap. \n\nThe highest coverage of the GM was observed in the language tasks-low condition (69%); other estimates were attention tasks-low (64%), social tasks-low (55%), and face processing tasks-low (48%). These findings showed that a larger area of the brain showed a lower activation in the ASD individuals versus normal participants, compared to a higher activation. On the other hand, attention tasks-high and language tasks-high maps showed 44% coverage of the GM, 36% in the face processing-high, and 19% in social tasks-high maps. \n\nWhen all eight brain maps in the four cognitive tasks were combined, 83% of the brain GM was covered, which suggests that fMRI is a strong tool in revealing signs of ASD. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \n### Summary of the results \n  \nThis study reviewed the task-based fMRI studies on ASD aiming to assess the potential of fMRI in predicting or diagnosing ASD in the future. The severity of the difference between the fMRI measures of the normal and ASD groups could suggest the fMRI to be useful. By initially recruiting 292 studies and reviewing the results of 131 fMRI works in the four cognitive abilities of interest, 73 brain structures showed an altered brain function between the two groups. In addition, a combination of the results of the four cognitive functions showed that about 83% of brain GM shows an altered activation in ASD compared to normal individuals. Future research to diagnose ASD using automatic algorithms, such as machine learning, would benefit from the findings of this study. \n\n\n### Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis \n  \nThe prevalence of ASD is 1 in 59 subjects in the US ( ), and 1 in 132 individuals globally ( ) the burden of ASDs has been estimated for the global burden of disease study 2010 (GBD 2010. They are much higher than previously reported. This data reflects the growing knowledge about ASD and innovations in the diagnostic approaches which enhanced evaluation of its clinical symptoms ( ). The main characteristic of autism\u2019s clinical manifestations is its significant heterogeneity; no two autism patients are alike, which means that each autistic individual shows unique phenotypic heterogeneity in the combination of symptom severity and comorbid conditions (anxiety, depression, social communication disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epileptic disorders) ( ). Early diagnosis would facilitate decisions for the selection of the best therapeutic method, improve the quality of life of children with ASD and their families ( ), and lead to preventing notable economic and emotional costs to autistic people and their families. Despite all these, early diagnosis is challenging ( ;  ). \n\nThere are numerous undetermined questions about the causes and the pathophysiology of ASD ( ). To date, diagnostic evaluation of ASD is based on clinical observation and interviews with caregivers using some standardized instruments, including an autism diagnostic observational schedule ( ). The lack of knowledge on the exact neural basis of autism spectrum disorder and the absence of validated diagnosis measures throughout development is challenging. To date, diagnostic evaluation for autism requires a team of professionals from different disciplines, including a physician, speech therapist, cognitive therapist, and occupational therapist. \n\nSince the first description of the disease in the early 1940s, researchers have been intensively trying to identify biological markers for ASD ( ). As mentioned before, the crucial challenges are the underlying biological heterogeneity of ASD. Nowadays, we can only reliably diagnose ASD based on the current standardized behavioral observations and psychometric tools ( ). Precise diagnostic assessments are required, as finding specific biomarkers for autism may reduce the variability of ASD diagnosis. Such methods are also helpful in evaluating treatment effects on the neurodevelopmental disorders. \n\nNeuroimaging has already played a pivotal role in ASD characterization by the in vivo monitoring of the brain structure and function during the disorder ( ). MRI is a safe, non-invasive, and powerful diagnostic tool for observing alterations in the brain\u2019s structure and function. Moreover, fMRI techniques are essential in forming these diagnostic assessments ( ). fMRI is considered to provide the required biomarkers for exploring and diagnosing the severity of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism ( ). Current research on structural and functional brain MRI indicates that identifying general biological alterations in most ASD patients requires large cohort sizes, and they often lead to numerous overlapping markers with those of other conditions and the public population, rather than a single marker ( ). As a result, more reliable algorithms are needed to use neuroimaging for purposes such as ASD diagnosis. Neuroimaging could be combined with machine learning methods for disease diagnosis or prediction ( ). These methods are already used for the ASD diagnosis. As an example, classification approaches using a support vector machine were used to characterize the structural changes of the brain in adults with ASD to discriminate them from the average population ( ). These methods have recently been reviewed ( ). In addition to separating patients and controls, these classifiers apply on a single-subject basis to aid diagnosis. This is done by assigning an abnormality score to each subject, quantifying the degree of pathology ( ). The current study aimed to initially show the potential of fMRI for ASD diagnosis along with machine learning algorithms and provide the biomarkers for fMRI in such works. \n\n\n### Face processing stimuli \n  \nThe fusiform gyrus, as well as the amygdala, STG, VMPFC, occipital face area, IFG, IOG, MTG, PCC, insula, MFG, cuneus, hippocampus, and striatum showed lower activation in the ASD group when processing faces. Striatum is involved in processing rewards, and for individuals with high autistic traits, facial mimicry is associated with lower reward-related neural response ( ). Amygdala showed a lower activation during the attentional orienting triggered by eye gaze ( ), suggesting that impairments associated with gaze-triggered attentional orienting could be modified by treatments directed at amygdala activity ( ). Decreased activation in the hippocampus also suggests problems integrating emotional information with declarative memory ( ). \n\nFusiform is vital in face processing ( ) and its activation is associated with one\u2019s face discrimination performance ( ). It is suggested that the phenotypic heterogeneity in face processing in ASD is mediated by neuronal selectivity to faces in this area ( ). Moreover, it is proposed that training on tasks that recruit face representation in this area could remediate face-processing differences ( ). Another study hypothesized that the abnormal activity of this area in autism could be due to inappropriate information acquisition during eye scanning ( ). Besides, ASD children differently recognize faces, as they focus more on feature-based than configured analyses, and the fusiform gyrus is associated with configural processing ( ). Also, fusiform face area activation depends on orientation toward the eyes during stimulus presentation ( ); therefore, this reduced activation may be caused by atypical eye-gaze patterns towards faces. \n\nMTG is involved in the processing of facial features and expressions ( ); meanwhile, it is also strongly modulated by top-down attentional mechanisms, hence, different attentional mechanisms concerning faces ( ) in ASD could be a reason for its declined activation. STG is active in tasks involving attributing intentions to moving geometric figures, and in social dysfunction in autism ( ). Other brain areas with a declined activation in ASD are also involved in face processing, such as the insula, a driving node in the salience network ( ), PCC in acquiring facial familiarity ( ), and IFG consistently being active during imitation, action observation, and intention understanding ( ). \n\nHigher activations in individuals with ASD while processing faces were observed in the amygdala, pulvinar, thalamus, MFG, and precuneus. The pulvinar nucleus and amygdala have roles in rapid face processing ( ). Higher activation in the subcortical areas, such as the amygdala, in children with ASD when looking at the eyes, is possibly related to their eye avoidance in daily life ( ). The subcortical system in ASD overreacts to stimuli that should be considered positively engaging and socially rewarding ( ), and for example, the amygdala hyper-responsiveness to direct gaze shows a neural indicator for heightened emotional arousal triggered by eye contact ( ). The thalamic hyperactivation is also hypothesized as one of the substrates of social cognition deficits in ASD, through its deregulatory impact on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( ). The activation of precuneus is modulated depending on attentional demands; therefore, its increased activation in ASD could be a compensatory mechanism ( ). The amygdala reported higher, lower, and no difference in activation between the ASD and healthy individuals in face processing. The inconsistent findings could be due to the differences in attention to the faces ( ) or the type of tasks and stimuli ( ). \n\n\n### Language stimuli \n  \nLanguage function is impaired in ASD children. They have difficulty generating words relevant to a context or topic ( ) and processing mental states and words related to emotions ( ). This impairment is also observed in patients with a lesion in the motor system ( ). There is altered recruitment of reading-related neural resources in ASD children, weaknesses in the top-down modulation of semantic processing ( ), and difficulties in using context to predict the final word of sentences ( ). Executive functions are critical for selecting, generating, and organizing words into sentences and sustaining meaningful conversations, and there are reports on impaired executive control of language in ASD ( ). \n\nA total of 22 brain structures showed a declined activation in language processing in the ASD children, including IFG, STG, cerebellum, MTG, fusiform, ACC, SFG, MFG, precentral gyrus, SMA, precuneus, cuneus, thalamus, MOG, PCC, putamen, caudate, medial frontal gyrus, amygdala, and insula. These structures are involved in different aspects of the language processing. The thalamus\u2019s putamen and ventral lateral nucleus are involved in fluency-related activity ( ). In contrast, temporal regions are essential in auditory processing ( ) particularly emotional prosody ( ). The ACC is activated in explicitly evaluating emotions ( ). The thalamus has a role in language and verbal memory ( ), in addition to visual attention ( ), suggestive of serial visual scanning during the initial steps of reading ( ). The left putamen has also been implicated in reading and language comprehension, especially in sub-lexical and lexical processing ( ). \n\nThe middle and superior frontal gyri are involved in executive functions ( ), attention, and working memory ( ); therefore, they are related to the cognitive evaluation of the emotional content ( ). LMFG is also reported to be a region involved in word retrieval during language production ( ), and there are numerous reports on the activation of the LMFG during single-word reading, sentence reading, and lexical retrieval ( ). This region is underactive in children with reading difficulty ( ). The lack of activation of the LMOG is previously shown in reading dysfunction, due to its role in reading intervention ( ). Frishkoff et al. ( ) also suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex discriminates congruous and incongruous words and its activity is sustained over time while processing semantic incongruities. In addition, the cerebellum has direct connections to Broca\u2019s area, which enables it to facilitate verbal abilities ( ). \n\nMeanwhile, 9 brain structures showed an elevated activation in ASD individuals, including STG, fusiform, MTG, IFG, MOG, PTG, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, and cuneus. The increased activation of brain areas in ASD is suggested to be a compensatory mechanism to aid in language comprehension ( ). There is evidence of recruiting more cortical resources during word generation in males and females with ASD ( ). Elevated fusiform activation has been shown in individuals with ASD to interpret the meaning of emotional words ( ). Greater activation of the cuneus is in line with the evidence of atypical reliance on the visual cortex in individuals with ASD ( ), as the cuneus activation is related to visual perception and retrieving stored mental imagery of word stimuli ( ). Individuals with ASD tend to recruit more visual cortex than IFG for word processing ( ). \n\nAnother finding is using right hemisphere language-analogous regions in ASD to assist reading. This finding supports the idea that autism is related to early left-hemisphere dysfunction ( ). Studies suggest that ASD children are more likely to show right-hemisphere lateralization for language ( ). For example, the right IFG has been more strongly implicated in emotional prosody processing than its contralateral homologs ( ). However, there are still disputes on whether the reversal of Broca\u2019s asymmetry in the language is a predisposing factor toward language impairment or a compensatory neurodevelopmental response to language dysfunction in the left hemisphere ( ), although the increased right hemisphere activity for the ASD group is mostly interpreted as reflecting more effortful processing ( ). \n\nCommonly referred to as Broca\u2019s area, the LIFG is involved in affective aspects of language processing, semantics, and visual memory ( ), in word processing and controlled retrieval and selection of semantic knowledge ( ), in unification operations required for binding single word information into larger structures (Fitzpatrick & Indefrey, 2009), in representing social knowledge and abstract social concepts ( ), and in attributing personality traits ( ). It also sub-serves verbal working memory by maintaining semantic representations ( ). This area had 26 reports of decreased and 4 reports of higher activation in ASD. The activation of this area is dependent on the stimuli, for example, elevated activation of letter fluency vs category ( ), and attenuation of responsiveness to manipulations of semantic congruity ( ). In addition, the different activation of this region in ASD could be linked to other perceptual and expressive deficits in affective communication ( ). \n\n\n### Attention tasks \n  \nThe neural mechanism of attention is different in ASD. The failure to orient attention toward salient stimuli is a fundamental problem in ASD that impairs social skills and learning ( ). It could be due to the abnormalities in their functional brain maturation ( ), which is associated with clinical symptoms of ASD and inattention ( ). Neural circuitry of attention is driven by hyper-responsivity to salience ( ), and the observed differences may reflect compensatory mechanisms enabling normal behavioral performance (Rahko et al., 2015). In addition, over-focused attention in ASD results from hyperarousal, seen as disinhibiting the competing sensory information that leads to attentional shifts ( ). Evidence shows that arousal regulation in ASD results from early deficits in disengaging attention (Rahko et al., 2015). ASD children are under-reactive to behaviorally-relevant stimuli. There are also findings of atypical functions of both top-down and bottom-up attention networks in these individuals, and they cannot filter irrelevant information ( ). \n\nA total of 14 brain structures have been shown to have lower activation in patients with ASD, including cerebellum, STG, IFG, precentral gyrus, SMA, post-central gyrus, insula, MFG, medial prefrontal, SPG, putamen, thalamus, caudate, and orbitofrontal gyrus. The cerebellum plays an essential role in attentional processes ( ), and is implicated in the neuropathology of ASD ( ). Caudate, STG, and SPG are involved in joint attention, facilitating attentional regulatory processes ( ), which show deficits in ASD. STG also plays a role in utilizing social cues to orient attention. However, in ASD, this area may not be sensitive to the social meaning conveyed by eye gaze ( ). Finally, putamen responds when a stimulus is important, but not when the behavioral significance is removed ( ). \n\nOn the contrary, 7 brain areas showed an elevated activation in ASD, including the medial prefrontal, precuneus, IFG, cerebellum, SMA, post-central gyrus, and amygdala. The activation of the visual cortex, particularly the precuneus, was significantly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms ( ). Precuneus is implicated in spatial attention and anticipation of motor responses ( ), and the deficits in this area were positively correlated with the severity of social reciprocity and communication problems ( ). The increased response in children with ASD may reflect hyper-responsivity of bottom-up processing of salient visual stimuli ( ). This increase may be attributable to differences in the visual receptive fields in ASD. There is evidence of increased perifoveal population receptive fields in extrastriate cortex, associated with hyper-excitability of the visual cortex or poor peripheral spatial attention in individuals with ASD ( ). \n\nStudies have indicated that the medial rostral PFC plays a role in attentional selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought ( ). This region also involves multitasking and prospective memory ( ). One suggestion based on these findings is that healthy individuals could modulate activity in their visual cortex according to the attentional demands of the task to a higher degree than the ASD group ( ). This finding also suggests functional underconnectivity in ASD ( ), decreasing top-down modulation of sensory areas according to attentional demands ( ). Moreover, the medial rostral PFC is involved in mentalizing ( ), and its higher activation in ASD raises the possibility that these individuals recruit brain regions typically associated with mentalizing to perform other tasks, such as face perception ( ). As an example, the inability to suppress task-related activation of the medial prefrontal cortex is linked to distractibility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ), and because of the high comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism ( ), this may indicate a particular difficulty with distraction during the global condition ( ). \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nThis study, initially including 292 papers and studying 131 in detail, first showed which cognitive domains are currently mainly studied in ASD individuals. The most checked domains are the best candidates for diagnosis\/prediction purposes. Also, the less studied cognitive functions could be suggestions for future works. Second, the study showed that a large part of the brain shows abnormalities in fMRI in ASD individuals compared to normal, suggesting fMRI\u2019s application in ASD diagnosis. For this aim, the study provided a comprehensive list of biomarkers for using task-based fMRI in the diagnosis\/prediction of ASD, which included the brain structures that showed an altered activation in ASD and the frequency of reports for each structure. All the 73 brain areas illustrated in   are ideal candidates for this purpose, with the brighter areas being stronger neuro-markers. FMRI imaging of an individual, and evaluating these biomarkers in methods such as machine-learning, could help assess an individual\u2019s risk of being in the ASD spectrum. \n\n### Study limitations \n  \nThere are a few limitations to our work. Several studies may be missing during our database searches. Our inferences were based on 131 studies from 292, including many works that could result in more comprehensive deductions. Also, the methodology and participants of the selected studies were not identical, the factors that could have associations with the findings of a study. More detailed discussions could be provided on our findings, and finally, practically using the reported biomarkers for ASD diagnosis would be helpful as a validation algorithm. \n\n\n\n## Ethical Considerations \n  \n### Compliance with ethical guidelines \n  \nThis study was part of a systematic review that was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Code: PROSPERO_2017_CRD42017070975). \n\n\n### Funding \n  \nThis study was financially supported by the Iranian Council for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies. \n\n\n### Authors\u2019 contributions \n  \nConceptualization: Mehdi Tehrani Doost and Seyed Amir Hossein Batouli; Methodology: Foroogh Razavi, Zeinab Oghabian and Minoo Sisakhti; The original draft preparation: Minoo Sisakhti, Foroogh Razavi, Zeinab Oghabian and Haady Ahmadzade; Visualization, supervision and writing\u2013review & editing: Mehdi Tehrani Doost and Seyed Amir Hossein Batouli; Project Administration and funding acquisition: Mehdi Tehrani Doost. \n\n\n### Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declared no conflict of interest.. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11016874,"text_md5":"710f2f979193e79549faddeaf94611e3","field_positions":{"authors":[0,134],"journal":[135,154],"publication_year":[156,160],"title":[171,278],"keywords":[292,364],"abstract":[377,1637],"body":[1646,43984]},"batch":1,"pmid":38628837,"doi":"10.32598\/bcn.2021.1774.3","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11016874","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11016874"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11016874\">11016874<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11016874  Examining the Dominant Presence of Brain Grey Matter in Autism During Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}

While consensus on treatments is still ongoing, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising approach for medication-resistant disorders, including substance use disorders. In this context, here we present the SUDMEX-TMS, a Mexican dataset from an rTMS clinical trial involving CUD patients. This longitudinal dataset comprises 54 CUD patients (including 8 females) with data collected at five time points: baseline (T0), two weeks (T1), three months (T2), six months (T3) follow-up, and twelve months (T4) follow-up. The clinical rTMS treatment followed a double-blinded randomized clinical trial design (n\u2009=\u200924 sham\/30 active) for 2 weeks, followed by an open-label phase. The dataset includes demographic, clinical, and cognitive measures, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected at all time points, encompassing structural (T1-weighted), functional (resting-state fMRI), and multishell diffusion-weighted (DWI-HARDI) sequences. This dataset offers the opportunity to investigate the impact of rTMS on CUD participants, considering clinical, cognitive, and multimodal MRI metrics in a longitudinal framework. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background and Summary \n  \nCocaine use disorder (CUD) is a worldwide public health problem with severe socio-economic consequences . Clinical outcomes include attention, learning, and working memory deficit, impulsivity, and structural brain alterations . Consequently, the pursuit of effective treatments has been a prominent focus in clinical research. Pharmacological approaches along with psychosocial therapy are currently the standard treatment with low to moderate efficacy . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as an innovative therapeutic strategy for mitigating CUD symptoms and drug use . \n\nCurrent research is aiming towards affecting the circuits underpinning various addiction-related processes, including craving and impulsivity . RTMS has the potential to activate these circuits and elicit long-term neuroplastic changes within the meso-cortico-limbic system . Furthermore, the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been instrumental in trying to find central biomarkers to measure disease severity and response to treatment. \n\nOur dataset stems from our placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which rTMS was used as an adjunct to standard treatment, referred to in this study as \u201ctreatment as usual\u201d (TAU). The main advantage of our dataset is that we acquired longitudinal psychiatric interviews with standard clinical assessment and multimodal MRI sequences, including multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. For specifics on the MRI sequences obtained, please refer to the participant\u2019s checklist available in the supplementary materials. \n\nTo date, our dataset has been used in various studies by other research teams. It has been employed to investigate both short and long-term clinical benefits of rTMS and their effects on functional connectivity , to identify cognitive deficits in CUD participants through machine learning algorithms , to improve diffusion MRI segmentation methods via deep learning techniques , to predict clinical outcomes by examining microstructural changes , and to establish a generalizable functional connectivity signature characterizing brain dysfunction in cocaine use disorder . The publications and pre-prints mentioned represent just a portion of the possible applications of our data. In this release, we provide access to the complete dataset, encompassing clinical, cognitive, and MRI data, for further analysis. Previously, we have released another dataset, the SUDMEX-CONN , which are independent yet acquired using the same scanner and similar sequences. Altogether, this dataset offers the opportunity to explore the longitudinal impact of rTMS as a promising adjunctive treatment for CUD and other SUDs, and to test new neuroimaging algorithms and analysis techniques. Some measurements from MRI and clinical tests have been used in different studies (See supplementary tables). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFrom a sample of n\u2009=\u2009117 patients, 54 patients were included in the study. The reasons for the dropouts are in Supplementary Material. The study ran from May 2017 to September 2019. The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Division of the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City, Mexico. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatr\u00eda \u201cRam\u00f3n de la Fuente Mu\u00f1iz\u201d (INPRFM) (CEI\/C\/070\/2016) and is in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02986438). All study participants were first interviewed to check for inclusion or exclusion criteria. Then, the patients were interviewed by the study psychiatrist, where she explained everything about the study in simple terms and followed the informed consent structure point by point. The patients were told about the absolute contraindications and possible secondary effects of the treatment, as well as how their data will be managed and disseminated. They were also told to bring a family member or another person to explain and co-sign the consent if they felt they had any doubts about it, or they could opt-out from the study without consequences at this or any point until their understanding was ensured. Patients were not paid for their participation. The patients who signed the informed consent were then included in the study. Cocaine dependence was diagnosed in CUD patients using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus Spanish version 5.0.0 . Demographic characteristics between groups are summarized in Table\u00a0 .   \nDemographic measures between groups. \n  \nContinuous variables are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and nominal as number (percentage from group): two-sample t-test and \u03c7\u00b2 was performed for each variable; no variables, n.a.: not applicable; CUD: cocaine use disorder. \n  \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nThe study consisted of four stages: 1) a screening interview to confirm substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis by a trained psychiatrist; 2) participants underwent a full clinical evaluation and initial MRI acquisition at baseline or Time 0 (T0); 3) an Acute stage (RCT) where patients underwent regularly scheduled sessions (Active or Sham rTMS) for 10 days over 2 weeks, after which they underwent clinical evaluation and MRI acquisition called Time 1 or T1. The blinding was opened, and only the patients in the sham group were invited to initiate active rTMS treatment for 2 weeks, after which they underwent another clinical evaluation and MRI acquisition called Time 1\u20134 or T1-4 (4 as in 4 weeks time). 4) Finally, after active rTMS treatment, all patients went into the open-label maintenance phase, and they underwent clinical evaluation and MRI acquisition at three months (Time 2 or T2), six months (Time 3 or T3) and 12 months (Time 4 or T4). The study design is detailed in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nSUDMEX-TMS experimental design. Clinical and MRI data were collected at the time of baseline (T0), at two weeks (T1), three months (T2), six months (T3) and 12 months (T4); * Patients who received the sham treatment and then received active treatment (T1\u20134). \n  \n\n\n### Study dropout \n  \nOut of the 54 recruited patients (T0), 30 were randomly assigned to active treatment, and 24 to sham rTMS. Five patients in the active rTMS group and four in the sham group discontinued the study, resulting in 24 patients completing the double-blind acute phase (2 weeks) in the active group and 20 in the sham group. Following this phase, 14 patients from the sham group chose to receive 2 weeks of acute rTMS therapy (2 weeks) after the sham phase. Participants dropouts were as follows: 1) 20 patients underwent 3 months of twice-weekly rTMS sessions, with 15 initially assigned to the active group and 5 to the sham group (T2); 2) among the study participants, 15 patients (n\u2009=\u200910 active, 5 sham), successfully completed 6 months of rTMS sessions (T3); and 3) 7 patients (n\u2009=\u20094 active, 3 sham), successfully completed 12 months of bi-weekly rTMS sessions (T4). Due to significant attrition at T1 (2 weeks), when the study was only about 30% complete, we extended the maintenance phase to 6 months instead of 12 months for new participants after obtaining approval from the ethics committee. Importantly, no adverse effects related to rTMS treatment were reported by patients who discontinued participation at any stage. None of the patients who discontinued treatment at any point reported adverse effects from rTMS. \n\n\n### Study timeline \n  \nAt Visit 1, the patients arrived for a clinical screening interview to confirm they met the criteria. At Visit 2, enrolled patients underwent a full clinical assessment (Time 0 or T0). Initial MRI scanning occurred at Visit 3 (Baseline or MRI-T0). The clinical interview preceded MRI acquisition and always occurred within 3 days. Following MRI acquisition, we initiated the double-blind rTMS\/sham acute phase (see below). Patients underwent regularly scheduled sessions (Active or Sham rTMS) for 10 days over 2 weeks. At the conclusion of 2 weeks (Visit 4; T1), they underwent clinical assessment and repeated MRI scanning, marking the end of the acute phase and the start of the open-label maintenance phase. The blind (Active vs. Sham) was decoded for each participant at the end of their acute phase. Patients assigned to Active rTMS entered the maintenance phase directly after T1. Patients assigned to Sham rTMS were given the choice to leave the study or continue with active open-label rTMS for compassionate use. Patients assigned to the Sham group who agreed to continue, received 2-weeks (10 days) acute treatment before continuing to the maintenance phase. The maintenance phase was initially designed to include 2 weekly rTMS sessions and clinical assessments and MRI scans at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. However, the maintenance phase was subsequently changed to 3 months for new enrollments. \n\n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition \n  \nMRI sequences were acquired using a Philips Ingenia 3T MR system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands, and Boston, MA, USA), with a 32-channel dS Head coil. The order of the sequences was the following for the single session: 1) resting state (rs-fMRI), 2) T1-weighted (T1w), and 3) High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (DWI-HARDI). This order was maintained across participants. Before the MRI acquisition, the amount of alcohol in participants\u2019 blood was measured using a breathalyzer alcohol test, and other substances were measured using a breath alcohol test and   Instant-view   multi-drug urine test. The total scan time was approximately 50\u2009min. During the study, the participants were fitted with MRI-compatible headphones and goggles (see Table\u00a0 ). Anonymization of the dataset was performed using pydeface to remove facial features .   \nSummary of the acquired data for clinical measures, cognitive measures and MRI sequences. \n  \nMini International Neuropsychiatric Interview - Plus; MINI- Plus, Addiction Severity Index; ASI, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders; SCID-II, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised; SCL-R, Cocaine Craving Questionnaire General CCQ-G and Now CCQ-N, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0; WHODAS, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale v. 11; BIS-11, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Short Form; EHI short,Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Cocaine Craving visual analogue scale (VAS). \n  \n\n\n### Anatomical images \n  \nT1-weighted images were acquired using a 3D FFE SENSE sequence, TR\/ TE\u2009=\u20097\/3.5\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm , matrix\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240 mm, 180 slices, gap\u2009=\u20090, plane\u2009=\u2009Sagittal, voxel\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm (5 participants were acquired with a voxel size\u2009=\u20090.75\u2009\u00d7\u20090.75\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm). \n\n\n### Diffusion-weighted imaging \n  \nThe DWI-HARDI was a spin echo (SE) sequence, with TR\/TE\u2009=\u20099000\/127\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009230 mm  (for 4 participants\u2009=\u2009224mm ), matrix\u2009=\u200996\u2009\u00d7\u200996 (the first 4 participants\u2009=\u2009112\u2009\u00d7\u2009112), number of slices\u2009=\u200957 (for 4 participants\u2009=\u200958), gap\u2009=\u20090, plane\u2009=\u2009axial, voxel\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm (the first 4 participants\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 x 2.3\u2009mm), directions: b0\u2009=\u20098, b-value 1000\u2009=\u200932\u2009s\/mm , b-value 2500\u2009=\u200996\u2009s\/mm  (for 4 participants: 96\u2009=\u2009b-value 3,000\u2009s\/mm ), with a total of 136 directions.

The total scan time of the rs-fMRI session was 10\u2009min, with a total of 300 volumes acquired. All participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, and to relax while not thinking about anything in particular. We used MRI-compatible goggles (fiber optic glasses SV-7021, Avotec) to show the participants a fixation cross (white cross with black background), and we used the included eye-tracking camera to prevent participants from falling asleep during this sequence. If the participants closed their eyes for more than 10\u2009seconds, we would wake them up using the communication through the headphones, reminding them to try to not fall asleep for the 10\u2009minutes the sequence lasted, and we restarted the sequence over. We acquired an opposite direction sequence for field mapping, using the same GE-EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR\/TE\u2009=\u20092000\/30\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200975\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u200980\u2009\u00d7\u200980, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200936, volumes\u2009=\u20094, phase encoding direction\u2009=\u2009PA. \n\n\n### Transcranial magnetic stimulation \n  \nWe performed a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with parallel groups (Sham\/Active) for 2 weeks (acute phase) and an open-label maintenance phase for 6 months. For the acute phase, we used a MagPro R301 Option magnetic stimulator and a figure-of-eight B65-A\/P coil (MagVenture, Alpharetta, GA); for the maintenance phase, we used a MagPro R30 stimulator and a figure-of-eight MCF-B70 coil (MagVenture). The acute phase comprised 10 weekdays of 5,000 pulses per day (two sessions of 50 trains at 5\u2009Hz, 50 pulses\/train, 10\u2009s inter-train interval, and 15\u2009min inter-session interval). The maintenance phase comprised 3 and 6 months of 5,000 pulses per day, 2 sessions per week. The maintenance phase comprised two 5-Hz excitatory frequency (5000 pulses per day) sessions per week. The stimulation was delivered at 100% motor threshold to the left Dorso-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (lDLPFC). The motor threshold was determined in each patient as described by Rossini   et al  . . We used a vitamin E capsule as a fiducial during MRI acquisition to identify the stimulation cortical target due to a lack of a brain navigator. In all rTMS sessions, we used either the 5.5\u2009cm anatomic Rule or the Beam F3 method. We changed to the superior Beam F3 method after the first 16 participants to improve lDLPFC localization . The motor threshold was maintained at 100% in all patients. Electrodes were applied to all patient\u2019s left temporalis muscles to simulate muscular contraction in the sham group, enhancing the sham and blinding. More information about TMS procedures is available in the supplementary material. \n\n\n### Clinical measures \n  \nPatients underwent paper-based clinical tests during each session. The included assessments were: 1) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), 2) Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview - Plus (MINI-Plus), 3) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 4) Cocaine Craving visual analog scale (VAS), 5) Addiction Severity Index (ASI), 6) Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II), 7) Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-R), 8) Cocaine Craving Questionnaire General (CCQ-G) and Now (CCQ-N), 9) World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS), 10) Barratt Impulsiveness Scale v. 11 (BIS-11), 11) Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Short Form, 12) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Trained mental health psychologists and psychiatrists conducted these tests in a distraction-free environment. A summary of the acquired data is presented in Table\u00a0 . In this section, we present a selection of the metrics employed in this study. For a comprehensive description of the remaining metrics, please refer to Angeles-Valdez   et al  .  and the original publications associated with each measure. \n\n\n### Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) \n  \nThe Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) assesses the global severity of anxiety and is valuable for monitoring treatment response . It comprises 14 items, measuring 13 anxious signs and symptoms, with the last item evaluating the patient\u2019s behavior during the interview. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 points, considering both intensity and frequency. The total score is the sum of each item\u2019s score, ranging from 0 to 56 points. Optimal HAM-A score ranges are as follows: no\/minimal anxiety (\u22647), mild anxiety (8\u201314), moderate anxiety (15\u201323), and severe anxiety (\u226524). \n\n\n### Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) \n  \nThis instrument was developed to measure sleep quality in patients with psychiatric disorders . It consists of 24 items, the assessment encompasses 7 dimensions: Subjective sleep quality, Sleep latency, Duration of sleep, Usual sleep efficiency, Sleep disturbances, Use of medication, and Daytime dysfunction. Respondents use a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 4. The correction involves obtaining a sleep profile for each dimension, ranging from 0 to 3, and a total score that can range from 0 to 21. \n\n\n### Cocaine Craving visual analogue scale (VAS) \n  \nThis instrument is designed for the subjective assessment of the participant\u2019s current craving. The visual scale comprises a continuous line of 10\u2009cm (including 2 decimal places). The left end represents \u2018no craving,\u2019 and the right end represents \u2018the most intense craving.\u2019 Participants are instructed to mark the intensity of their current craving by placing a cross on the scale . \n\n\n### Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) \n  \nThe Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was employed to gauge the severity of depression . The version we used is one of 17 items, with its content centering on depressive behavior. Vegetative, cognitive, and anxiety symptoms carry the most significant weight in the total calculation of the scale. Cutoff points for defining severity are as follows: no depression (0\u20137), mild depression (8\u201316), moderate depression (17\u201323), and severe depression (\u226524). \n\n\n### Cognitive tests \n  \nAt each of the three stages, patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The computer-based assessments, including Berg\u2019s Card Sorting Test, Flanker Task, Go\/No-Go task, Iowa Gambling Task, Tower of London, and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, were conducted using the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) version 2.0 with Spanish translation . On the other hand, the Digit-Span Backward and Letter-Numbers Sequencing exams were administered on paper. All cognitive tests were administered by a licensed psychologist in a quiet setting to minimize distractions. The assessments took place after the MRI scan, with a total duration of 45\u2009minutes per participant. \n\nHere, we only describe some of the metrics applied, the complete descriptions of the rest of the metrics can be found in the work by Angeles-Valdez   et al  . , as well as in the original publications for each measure. \n\n\n\n## Data Records \n  \n### MRI organization \n  \nThe organization of the dataset follows the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS, v. 1.0.1) ( ), commonly used to facilitate data sharing and project unifications by folder and file name structure according to sequence modality (Fig.\u00a0 ) . MRI images are shared in the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (Nifti) format converted from Digital Imaging and Communication In Medicine (DICOM) using dcm2bids v.2.1.4 ., along with data descriptions and metadata in JavaScript Object Notification files. The dataset is available and hosted on the OpenNeuro  Data sharing platform ( ) . The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) employs a hierarchical subdirectory layout. At the root resides the dataset, followed by individual session folders. Within each session, modality-specific folders organize the sequences. The MRI images are inside each folder alongside a JSON descriptor, detailing its run-specific metadata (Fig.\u00a0 ). The structure tutorial is available on the BIDS website ( ).   \nDescriptive image of the existing files in each platform. (  A  ) MRI data files and BIDs organization in OpenNeuro platform, (  B  ) Clinical and cognitive files and organization in Zenodo platform. \n  \n\n\n### Clinical and cognitive organization \n  \nThe clinical, cognitive, and demographic data are available in the Zenodo repository (10.5281\/zenodo.10409461) . The data set is curated and organized by test type for each experimental phase. The Zenodo repository houses each test type in an individual spreadsheet, separated by variables (columns) and each participants\u2019 observations (rows), with individual items and total scores as variables. Additionally, a dedicated metadata sheet acts as a comprehensive glossary that defines each variable\u2019s nomenclature, type, and level of measurement (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## Technical Validation of the MRI \n  \n### Quality Control \n  \nTo assess the quality control of sMRI and rsMRI sequences we used the MRIQC v.0.15 tool . The extracted values for sMRI were Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) (Fig.\u00a0 ). SNR is related to the ratio of the mean voxel intensity of an image in contrast with the random noise intensity , whereas the CNR measure is an extension of SNR that is not influenced by contrast changes . For rsMRI the extracted values were Framewise Displacement (FD) and temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) (Fig.\u00a0 ).

New studies can be focused on the impact of rTMS over the active group in contrast to sham, on multimodal MRI data and\/or clinical\/cognitive measures. To use the present dataset in conjunction with other datasets, such as those of the ENIGMA consortium, we recommend the use of an MRI-site harmonization technique such as ComBatHarmonization . Here, we provided QC information in order to facilitate data usage of which participants could be dismissed from data analysis. We recommend the use of artifact correction methods for preprocessing data due to the high motion of some subjects during scanning. The present dataset was released and peer reviewed in 2023 based on MRI OpenNeuro version 2.1.0 and Zenodo platform version 4.2. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11035677,"text_md5":"c1906bccccb930e3a1d9acf3bdacdbf2","field_positions":{"authors":[0,202],"journal":[203,211],"publication_year":[213,217],"title":[228,357],"keywords":[371,427],"abstract":[440,1757],"body":[1766,26292]},"batch":1,"pmid":38649689,"doi":"10.1038\/s41597-024-03242-y","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11035677","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11035677"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11035677\">11035677<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11035677  The Mexican dataset of a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation clinical trial on cocaine use disorder patients: SUDMEX TMS"}

Previous studies have shown that children with prenatal marijuana exposure have developmental deficits in memory and decreased attentiveness. In this study, we assess whether prenatal marijuana exposure is associated with alterations in brain regional morphometry and functional and structural connectivity in adolescents. We downloaded behavioural scores and subject image files from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development  Study. A total of 178 anatomical and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging files (88 prenatal marijuana exposure and 90 age- and gender-matched controls) and 152 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging files (76 prenatal marijuana exposure and 76 controls) were obtained. Behavioural metrics based on the parent-reported child behavioural checklist were also obtained for each subject. The associations of prenatal marijuana exposure with 17 subscales of the child behavioural checklist were calculated. We assessed differences in brain morphometry based on voxel-based and surface-based morphometry in adolescents with prenatal marijuana exposure versus controls. We also evaluated group differences in structural and functional connectivity in adolescents for region-to-region connectivity and graph theoretical metrics. Interactions of prenatal marijuana exposure and graph networks were assessed for impact on behavioural scores. Multiple comparison correction was performed as appropriate. Adolescents with prenatal marijuana exposure had greater abnormal or borderline child behavioural checklist scores in 9 out of 17 subscales. There were no significant differences in voxel- or surface-based morphometry, structural connectivity or functional connectivity between prenatal marijuana exposure and controls. However, there were significant differences in prenatal marijuana exposure\u2013graph network interactions with respect to behavioural scores. There were three structural prenatal marijuana exposure\u2013graph network interactions and seven functional prenatal marijuana exposure\u2013graph network interactions that were significantly associated with behavioural scores. Whilst this study was not able to confirm anatomical or functional differences between prenatal marijuana exposure and unexposed pre-adolescent children, there were prenatal marijuana exposure\u2013brain structural and functional graph network interactions that were significantly associated with behavioural scores. This suggests that altered brain networks may underlie behavioural outcomes in adolescents with prenatal marijuana exposure. More work needs to be conducted to better understand the prognostic value of brain structural and functional network measures in prenatal marijuana exposure. \n  \nVishnubhotla   et al  . demonstrate that prenatal marijuana exposure is associated with worse behavioural scores in adolescents. Prenatal marijuana exposure also impacts the association between several structural and functional graph network measures and behavioural scores, suggesting that altered brain networks could underlie adverse behavioural outcomes in adolescents with prenatal marijuana exposure. \n   Graphical Abstract  \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSeveral studies have shown an increasing prevalence of marijuana use following legalization trends, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported marijuana as the most commonly used illicit drug globally in 2016.  Along with increasing rates of marijuana use, there has been an increase in the number of women using marijuana whilst pregnant. Alleviation of nausea, vomiting and morning sickness have been cited as common reasons for marijuana use during pregnancy. Additionally, there is an increasing perception of safety with prenatal marijuana exposure (PME), as many pregnant women report being unaware of any adverse effects associated with PME.  Marijuana is the most common recreational drug used in pregnancy.  A cross-sectional study found that out of 367,403 pregnancies between 2009 and 2017 in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population, self-reported daily cannabis use during pregnancy was 3.38% in 2017.  In a follow-up study, cannabis-only use during pregnancy rose to 6.3% in 2018.  The 2020 National Survey of Drug Use and Health reported marijuana use in the past month among pregnant women aged 15\u201344 as 8%.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that rates may be higher since women were twice as likely to screen positive for marijuana use in a urine test than self-report.  Therefore, these are likely underestimates because data from most studies is self-reported. \n\nDespite the increasing prevalence of PME, there is a relative lack of knowledge on the long-term effects of PME. Previous studies have shown that PME leads to developmental deficits\u2014such as gaps in problem-solving skills and memory, increased depressive and anxiety symptoms, and decreased ability to remain attentive in school-aged children with PME compared with controls.  The Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study  showed developmental challenges in children with PME that persisted from birth until 12 years of age. These developmental challenges included decreased verbal memory, poorer sustained attention, increased risk for hyperactivity and impulsivity and poorer executive functioning. Other researchers have shown that these cognitive and behavioural challenges continued onto adulthood as those with PME showed decreased response inhibition, and significantly greater brain activity compared with unexposed controls when performing executive functioning tasks. \n\nEffects of PME on the brain have been assessed through neuroimaging studies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reveal impaired executive functioning,  response inhibition  and visuospatial working memory  in children with PME compared with controls. Additionally, prenatal drug exposure, including marijuana, has shown to impact brain functional network connectivity.  Assessing brain network connectivity could help predict those at risk for developmental conditions. For example, children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are shown to have altered brain network connectivity,  and risk of behavioural problems in children with ADHD children are associated with altered functional connectivity.  Assessing structural connectivity is also important as white matter microstructural alterations have been associated with disruptive behaviours. \n\nBrain structure and function can be assessed through direct connections between regions of interest (ROIs) and interactions between regions or through organized frameworks called graph networks. Graph networks are relationships or connections between multiple brain regions that are mathematically assessed utilizing systems composed of nodes (specific brain region) and edges (connections between nodes). Several metrics are used to understand how inter-connected these nodes are, that may be global, comprising the entire network, or local, in a particular region of the network. These graph network metrics provide information on global and local network connectivity that cannot be assessed by simple ROI-to-ROI connectivity, which assesses each connection independently. \n\nGraph theory metrics have been applied in neuroimaging to understand networks in the human brain.  For example, individuals with ADHD had lower global and local efficiencies (measures of how well a network exchanges information), along with a longer characteristic path length (indicating lower efficiency).  In the adult population, individuals with ADHD had lower local efficiencies and altered clustering coefficients (a measure of the extent regions cluster together) in multiple regions.  Additionally, reduced values in another graph network measure, betweenness centrality (a measure of the amount of influence a region has in the flow of information), in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were associated with greater stress. \n\nSince brain structural and functional connectivity could be an important measure of developmental and behavioural problems and PME can be associated with adverse behavioural and developmental outcomes, we assess (i) the impact of PME on developmental and behavioural problems, and (ii) the impact of PME on the associations of altered brain morphology, structural connectivity and functional connectivity with behavioural outcomes in adolescents. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Gathering data \n  \nData were acquired from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development  (ABCD\u00ae) Study ( ), held in the NIMH Data Archive.  Subjects were screened for PME, excluding exposure to substances such as alcohol, tobacco and other illicit drugs. Controls were screened and excluded for exposure to marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and other illicit drugs. Additionally, controls were selected to have a similar gender composition to the PME subjects. Demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, mean age, mean birth weight, maternal prescription medications, premature birth and maternal education, were compared between the PME and control groups. The parent-reported child behavioural checklist (CBCL)  scores were also downloaded for each subject. \n\nMinimally processed resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) images, diffusion-weighted images and T -weighted anatomical images were also downloaded. Image samples were processed as described by Hagler   et al  .  Briefly, fMRI data had B0 correction, unwarping and motion correction. Diffusion images had B0 correction, unwarping, motion correction and eddy current correction. Anatomical images had unwarping, intensity inhomogeneity correction and rigid body registration. \n\n\n### Behavioural metrics \n  \nBehavioural metrics were based on a parent-reported CBCL  and used 17 subscales. These include anxiety\/depression, withdrawn\/depression, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behaviour, aggressive behaviour, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, ADHD, oppositional disorder, conduct disorder, sluggish cognition, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress problems and total problems. Internalizing problems included scales for anxiety, withdrawal, depression and somatic complaints whilst externalizing problems included scales for rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours.  There were specific scales for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria including ADHD, oppositional and conduct disorders.  The scales used were normative, where 50 was considered average and clinical cut-offs of 65\u201369 for borderline and 70+ for clinically abnormal values. The impact of demographic characteristics such as age, sex, presence of PME, maternal education and partner education was assessed. Differences in CBCL clinical categories between PME and control groups were also assessed. \n\n\n### Voxel-based and surface-based morphometry \n  \nVoxel-based morphometry and surface-based morphometry were calculated from T -weighted anatomical images using Computational Anatomy Toolbox 12.6 (CAT12) (Jena, Germany),  a toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 12 (SPM12).  Steps for voxel-based morphometry processing include denoising,  affine pre-processing, local adaptive segmentation, skull stripping and spatial normalization.  Voxel-based morphometry grey matter segmentations were then smoothed at 8-mm full width at half maximum. Additional steps for surface-based morphometry processing utilize the projection-based thickness method  along with topology correction and spherical mapping.  Surface data were resampled based on a 32-K vertices surface mesh  and smoothed to 15-mm full width at half maximum. For statistical analysis, two contrasts were set\u2014PME > control and control > PME. Clusters less than 10 voxels were excluded. Total intracranial volume was used as a covariate for voxel-based morphometry. \n\n\n### Tract-based spatial statistics \n  \nDiffusion-weighted images, b-value, and b-vector files were downloaded from the ABCD\u00ae Study database. Tract-based spatial statistics  were performed using the FMRIB (for fMRI of the brain) software library (FSL, Oxford, UK).  First, fractional anisotropy (FA) images were created by fitting a tensor model using FMRIB\u2019s diffusion toolbox and then brain extracted using FSL\u2019s brain extraction tool.  Subjects\u2019 data were aligned into a common space using FMRIB\u2019s non-linear image registration tool  using a b-spline representation of the registration warp field.  A mean FA skeleton was generated representing the centre of group tracts. Each subject\u2019s FA data was projected onto the skeleton and voxelwise cross-subject statistics were generated. Data for mean diffusivity and axial diffusivity were obtained and data for radial diffusivity were calculated by taking the mean of the second and third eigenvalues. Mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity data were projected onto mean FA skeleton and cross-subject statistics were generated similar to FA. Comparisons were made between PME and unexposed controls using a general linear model and voxelwise statistics were performed using threshold-free cluster enhancement in   randomize.  \n\n\n### Tractography \n  \nDiffusion-weighted images, b-value, and b-vector files were downloaded from the ABCD\u00ae Study database. The b-tables were imported and corrected using DSI Studio ( ) using a population average template.  Diffusion data were reconstructed in the Montreal Neurological Institute space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction  and aligned with the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template.  Tractography was performed on the whole brain with DSI Studio using a deterministic fibre tracking algorithm  with a diffusion sampling ratio of 1.25. Three million tracts were calculated for each subject. The quantitative anisotropy threshold was set to software optimization. The angular threshold was set at 45\u00b0 and the step size was 0.75\u2005mm. Track lengths shorter than 20\u2005mm or longer than 200\u2005mm were discarded. The International Consortium for Brain Mapping template  was registered to subject space through non-linear transformation. Brain parcellation regions were based on the automated anatomical labelling version 2 atlas.  Connectivity matrices and graph network measures were calculated in DSI Studio based on fibre count. \n\n\n### Structural pairwise connectivity \n  \nConnectivity matrices with 120 ROIs were collected for each subject based on fibre count. Regions involving the cerebellum and vermis were excluded, leaving 94 ROIs for the analysis. The count data were firstly normalized via square root transformation. Robust linear regression was employed to assess the significance of PME on connectivity, where predictors include age, sex, PME, maternal education and partner education. \n\n\n### Structural graph network measures \n  \nNetwork measures for fibre count were collected for each subject within DSI Studio based on the Brain Connectivity Toolbox.  Prior studies have shown altered graph networks in developmental conditions.  Therefore, we evaluated network measures including average path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Networks were based on weighted values. The significance of PME on network measures was assessed using a linear regression. Age, sex, PME, maternal education and partner education were predictors and network measures were the response variables. \n\n\n### rs-fMRI pre-processing \n  \nPre-processing and analysis of rs-fMRI data were performed with CONN Toolbox (Cambridge, MA).  Samples obtained from the ABCD database were already minimally processed with B0 correction, unwarping and motion correction as described by Hagler   et al  .  that we used for further analysis. Functional and structural MRI data were normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute T  template using a direct normalization process. Data were segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.  Isotropic resolution of 1\u2005mm for structural images and 2\u2005mm for functional images were used. Next, the data were smoothed using spatial convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full width at half maximum. \n\nDenoising involved removing of noise from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid,  scrubbing  and session effects. For temporal band pass filtering, the lower frequency threshold was 0.008\u2005Hz, and the upper frequency threshold was 0.09\u2005Hz. Filtering was performed after regression to avoid mismatch in nuisance regressor procedure. \n\n\n### Independent component analysis \n  \nIndependent component analysis was conducted using CONN Toolbox  based on the methodology as described by Calhoun   et al  .  Comparisons were made between PME and unexposed controls. Clusters less than five voxels in size were discarded. \n\n\n### rs-fMRI analysis \n  \nFunctional connectivity was assessed between ROIs using CONN Toolbox.  ROI-to-ROI analysis was performed based on 106 regions of the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas,  distributed by Conn Toolbox. Cerebellar regions were excluded from the analysis. Statistical analysis was also performed in CONN Toolbox. Comparisons were made between PME and unexposed controls using a weighted general linear model.  Analyses were conducted on Fisher   z  -transformed correlations. \n\n\n### Functional graph network measures \n  \nFunctional graph network measures were obtained using CONN Toolbox based on the Brain Connectivity Toolbox.  Prior studies have shown altered graph networks in developmental conditions.  Therefore, we evaluated network measures including average path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. The significance of PME on network measures was assessed using a robust linear regression. Age, sex, PME, maternal education and partner education were the predictors and network measures were the response variables. \n\n\n### Correlating behavioural data with graph network measures \n  \nClinically relevant CBCL metrics were correlated with graph network measures and PME to assess their impact on clinical scores. The significance of network measures and PME on clinical scores was assessed using linear regression for structural and functional data. Age, sex, PME, maternal education, partner education and network measure were the predictors and CBCL scores were the response variables. An interaction between PME and network measures was included in the analysis so that significance was assessed for each group separately, as well as for the interaction term. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using R Studio (posit.co\/products\/open-source\/rstudio\/), MATLAB\u00ae ( ; MathWorks; Natick, MA, USA), and within individual processing packages. \n\nThe impact of demographic characteristics such as age, sex, presence of PME, maternal education and partner education on behavioural measures was assessed using a general linear model. Differences in clinical categories were calculated using a Fisher\u2019s exact test. Multiplicity was corrected following the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure to control for the false discovery rate.  An adjusted   P  -value of <0.05 was considered significant. \n\nStatistics for voxel-based and surface-based morphometry were calculated in SPM, statistics for TBBS were calculated in FSL, and statistics for fMRI independent component analysis were calculated in CONN Toolbox. Structural ROI-to-ROI connectivity was calculated using the sum of square errors followed by a robust linear regression. Functional ROI-to-ROI analysis was conducted in CONN Toolbox. Structural and functional graph network measures were calculated in DSI Studio and CONN Toolbox, respectively. Statistical comparisons of graph network measures were performed using linear regressions. Multiplicity was corrected following the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure to control for the false discovery rate.  In all cases, significance was determined by an adjusted   P  -value of <0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nThere were 178 subjects included in this study\u201488 (35 males) prenatally exposed to marijuana and 90 (37 males) without prenatal marijuana exposure. Both groups did not have history of prenatal exposure to other substances, such as alcohol, tobacco and other illicit drugs. Maternal education level was significantly different for PME versus unexposed controls (  P   = 0.0013). Factors such as birth weight, maternal prescription medications and premature birth were not statistically different. The demographic data are summarized in  . \n  \nDemographic information of children with PME and unexposed controls \n    \n\n### Behavioural metrics \n  \nBehavioural metrics were based on the parent-reported CBCL  from which we used data from 17 subscales. These scales had clinical cut-offs of 65\u201369 for borderline, and 70+ for clinical cases. Mean values were significantly greater in those with PME for all scales except the anxiety\/depression and somatic complaint scales. Based on a general linear model, PME had a significant effect on 16 out of the 17 scales after correcting for multiple comparisons. No other variables were significant after multiple comparison corrections ( ). Clinical outcomes were significantly different in those with PME compared with unexposed controls in 9 of 17 scales. These include thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behaviour, aggressive behaviour, externalizing problems, ADHD, conduct disorder, sluggish cognition and total problems.

However, these did not maintain significance after correcting for multiple comparisons. The data are visualized in  . \n\n\n### Structural graph network measures \n  \nDifferences in structural graph network measures were measured in 88 PME children and 90 unexposed children. None of the global graph network metrics showed significant differences.

This is shown in  . \n\n\n### Functional graph network measures \n  \nDifferences in structural graph network measures were measured in 76 PME children and 76 unexposed children. None of the global graph network metrics showed significant differences.

However, the significance for these metrics was not sustained when corrected for multiple comparisons. The data are summarized in  . \n\n\n### Prediction of behavioural measures based on graph networks and PME \n  \nWe assessed the predictive value of graph network measures on behavioural scores using linear models. For this, we assess the significance of network\u2013PME interactions for nine behavioural scores that demonstrated significant differences between PME and unexposed controls. In our predictive interaction plot, differences in slopes between PME and controls represent different effects of graph network measures on behavioural scores. For structural networks, there was a significant difference in PME\u2013network interactions in local efficiency ( ) and clustering coefficient in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) ( ) for the externalizing problems scale. Additionally, there was a significant difference in PME\u2013network interactions in betweenness centrality in the right amygdala for the total problems scale ( ).

A false discovery rate less than 0.05 was considered significant. \n  \nA similar assessment was performed for functional graph networks. Here, there was a significant difference in PME\u2013network interactions in betweenness centrality in the right inferior temporal gyrus ( ) and the left cuneus ( ) for the rule-breaking behaviour scale. There were also several significant PME\u2013network interactions that were significant predictors for sluggish cognition. Networks where this was observed include betweenness centrality in the left calcarine sulcus ( ), clustering coefficient in the left middle gyrus ( ) and clustering coefficient in the left inferior temporal gyrus ( ).

Overall, PME was a significant contributor to worse behavioural scores in 16 out of 17 CBCL scales, with the somatic complaint scale being the only exception. In this analysis, none of the other factors (age, sex, maternal education and partner education) were significant predictors for behavioural outcomes. Based on clinical thresholds, 9 out of 17 behavioural scales were significantly influenced by PME, after correcting for multiple comparisons. Effected scales were related to attention and behavioural problems. PME was less strongly associated with internalizing factors such as anxiety and depression. Our results are concordant with prior findings showing PME being associated with a higher risk of developing behavioural problems and ADHD. \n\nDespite significant differences in behavioural scores between adolescents with PME and non-PME controls, differences in neuroimaging measurements were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in brain structure on both voxel-based and surface-based morphometry after multiple comparison corrections. Similarly, there were no significant differences in FA, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity or radial diffusivity. However, other studies have shown that children with PME demonstrated greater thickness in the frontal cortices  and alterations in brain volume. These different results may be related to different ages at evaluation, socioenvironmental confounders or image analysis methods. \n\nResults for differences in structural and functional connectivity were mixed. We assessed connectivity using both ROI-to-ROI and graph network connectivity. ROI-to-ROI connectivity involves direct connections, either anatomical or functional, from one region to another. On the other hand, graph networks are organizational frameworks involving nodes and edges that are centred around a particular brain region or the whole brain. From our results, there were no significant differences of ROI-to-ROI or graph network connectivity based on the presence of PME. However, several PME\u2013graph network interactions were significant predictors for multiple behavioural scales. \n\nGraph network metrics that were involved with significant differences between PME and control groups include clustering coefficient, local efficiency and betweenness centrality. All significant metrics were significant at the nodal level (anatomical ROI). Clustering coefficient is a measure of how nodes tend to cluster together. At the level of a node, or brain region, this is the proportion of connections that are being utilized by its neighbouring regions compared with the total number of possible connections.  Local efficiency is involved with how well information is exchanged between its neighbouring regions in the absence of the node.  Increased levels of both indicate greater connectivity. Betweenness centrality is a metric that indicates the amount of influence a region has for the overall network. This is assessed by the number of shortest paths that travel through the brain region. \n\nThere were several structural graph networks that had significantly different correlations with behavioural scores based on the presence of PME. Correlations between graph network metrics (clustering coefficient and local efficiency) of the right lateral OFC with externalizing problems in the PME versus control groups. This indicates that local connectivity of the right lateral OFC and neighbouring regions may have different association to externalizing problems in those with PME. The OFC is an important structure for decision-making and the lateral OFC has been linked to conforming to social values,  suppression of responses,  evaluation of punishment  and devaluation.  Another node that showed differences in correlation of structural metrics with behavioural scores was betweenness centrality of the right amygdala for the total problems scale. This suggests that the influence of the right amygdala may have a different association with total problems scores in those with PME compared with controls. The amygdala has been associated with emotions such as fear  and memory  and is a component of the rewards network.  The amygdala is also functionally connected to the OFC,  and this connection is shown to be responsible for with social anxiety,  immediate rewards,  goal-directed behaviour  and reinforcement.  Additionally, betweenness centrality in the amygdala has been associated with increased stress. \n\nOur results suggest that PME differentially impacts the association of several functional graph networks and behavioural scores. First, we identified differences in correlations of betweenness centrality in the right fusiform gyrus and left cuneus with the rule-breaking scale in those with PME compared with controls. The fusiform gyrus is an important region for facial recognition, and connectivity in this region has been linked to learning disabilities such as dyslexia.  The cuneus is involved with visual processing and atypical connectivity in this region has been linked with autism spectrum disorders.  Increased significance of these regions in those specifically with PME is noteworthy. \n\nSecond, we identified differences in associations of functional graph network metrics (betweenness centrality in the left calcarine sulcus and clustering coefficient in the left anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri) with the sluggish cognition scale. Increased influence of the left calcarine sulcus is associated with poorer outcomes of sluggish cognition in those with PME compared with controls. Reduced connectivity in the neighbouring regions may imply that these systems are more poorly regulated. The calcarine sulcus is a prominent component in the visual cortex and functional connectivity in the region has been linked with eye misalignment.  The calcarine sulcus may play a more significant role in cognition in those with PME. \n\nIncreased regional connectivities in the left anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri were associated with poorer outcomes of sluggish cognition in those with PME compared with controls. The middle and inferior temporal gyri are involved with semantic processing and visual perception. The association between increased regional connectivity and increased symptoms, even if the overall correlation is weak, is somewhat unexpected. Greater connectivity would typically be associated with improved functioning. However, it is possible that this greater regional connectivity could be a form of overcompensation for functional deficits. \n\nFinally, we identified differences associations of the functional graph network clustering coefficient in the posterior cingulate cortex with the total problems scale in PME versus controls. The posterior cingulate cortex is a highly connected region that is an important region of the default mode network. Considering that the default mode network is associated with mind wandering,  increased clustering coefficient may be associated with sluggish outcomes. However, this effect was notable in the PME population and not the controls. Altered connectivity in the default mode network has also been linked to many disorders including ADHD,  depression,  schizophrenia  and other mental disorders. \n\nIn those with PME, there was a significant association of multiple graph measures in regions involving visual processing with behavioural outcomes. This is unsurprising given that PME has been linked with impaired visual processing in infants and toddlers.  This may contribute to impaired learning as children with PME can increase the risk of learning disabilities and ADHD. \n\nOther studies have demonstrated important findings on the short- and long-term impact of PME. The Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study found that PME impacted neurocognition at various stages of life.  Whilst no correlation between PME and overall IQ was found, the study did find that children with PME tend to score more poorly on tasks related to executive functioning. Neonates with PME demonstrated decreased visual habituation and increased tremors. As children, the PME group had poorer verbal skills, memory, attention, visual perception and executive functioning. Similar issues seemed to continue into adulthood as they exhibited reduced concentration and inhibition along with impaired visual memory analytical skills.  From this study, 31 subjects underwent fMRI using four tasks  with the results demonstrating that the PME group had increased brain activity in left posterior brain regions for similar tasks compared with unexposed controls. \n\nOther studies have shown differences in structural and functional connectivity in infants with PME.  The lack of persistence of these structural and functional alterations may be at least partly explained by developmental neuroplasticity and postnatal factors. However, we identified differences in associations of multiple structural and functional graph network measures for behavioural scores based on the presence of PME. This would suggest that despite neuroplasticity, there may be some persistent focal developmental impacts of prenatal marijuana on the brain. \n\nThere have been other studies examining the long-term effects of PME based on subjects with the ABCD database. Based on a larger sample size from the ABCD\u00ae Study, differences in behavioural outcomes were observed in subjects with PME.  Additionally, in the same study, significantly lower brain volumes were reported after multiple comparison corrections. Positive confirmatory findings for brain volume, which were not found in our study, may be due to a larger sample size and greater statistical power. Another study by Cioffredi   et al  .  looked at PME in the context of three fMRI tasks and CBCL scores from the ABCD\u00ae Study. Similar to our study, they identified adolescents with PME having greater attention, externalizing and total problems scores. Additionally, they did not observe differences in terms of cognitive performance or patterns of brain activation during tasks. This falls in line with our results in that there were significant differences in behavioural scores, particularly externalizing scores, but there were no confirmatory findings regarding differences in MRI measurements. \n\nOverall, this study showed a significant influence of PME on behavioural scores for 16 out of 17 scales and clinical categories for 9 out of 17 scales. Furthermore, several PME\u2013graph network interactions were identified as significant predictors for multiple behavioural scales. This indicates that network measures in these regions could be biomarkers for those with PME who may be at risk for developmental and behavioural problems. On the other hand, we were not able to find a significant difference in anatomical measurements or brain connectivity between the PME and control groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. However, other studies have shown significant differences in these factors. Additionally, considering that there were several interactions terms that were significant for multiple behavioural scales, it is likely that PME has some effect on connectivity even though these could not pass the statistical threshold in our study due to limitations due to retrospective nature and probable undetermined environmental effects in the ABCD data. \n\nThere are several limitations that need to be noted. For the ABCD database, the proportion of adolescents with PME was relatively small, and being a retrospective assessment, there may be recall bias. For future studies, we would recommend using a prospective design and follow-up of a larger cohort tracking children from the neonatal stage to adolescence to better assess the causality of PME on developmental conditions such as behavioural problems or ADHD and more accurately assess brain developmental alterations. Whilst we assessed the differences between PME and unexposed children, we did not account for the amount of cannabis used. Although we had 178 subjects with behavioural scores, only 152 subjects had fMRI data. We used different atlases for different imaging modalities. For structural connectivity, we used the automated anatomical labelling version 2 atlas, and for functional connectivity, we used the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas. Since we did not correlate data from the different imaging modalities, there is limited effect for these differences. Finally, this study also did not take into account postnatal effects, as these have also shown to impact behavioural outcomes for children with prenatal substance exposure. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study, based on images and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, assessed the impact of PME on neurodevelopment in pre-adolescent children. There were significant differences in multiple CBCL scales in PME children compared with unexposed controls. There were no statistically significant differences in anatomical measurements and brain connectivity between the PME and control groups. However, there were PME\u2013graph network interactions that were significant for behavioural scores. This suggests that altered brain networks may underlie behavioural outcomes in adolescents with PME. More work needs to be conducted to better understand the prognostic value of brain structural and functional network measures in PME. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10914455,"text_md5":"69bf600209ad57a2b5970aabbc8e0ea2","field_positions":{"authors":[0,78],"journal":[79,91],"publication_year":[93,97],"title":[108,229],"keywords":[243,339],"abstract":[352,3584],"body":[3593,44491]},"batch":1,"pmid":38444906,"doi":"10.1093\/braincomms\/fcae001","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10914455","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10914455"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10914455\">10914455<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10914455  Impact of prenatal marijuana exposure on adolescent brain structural and functional connectivity and behavioural outcomes"}
{"text":"Kuai, Changxiao and Pu, Jiayong and Wang, Donglin and Tan, Zhonglin and Wang, Yan and Xue, Shao-Wei\nSci Rep, 2024\n\n# Title\n\nThe association between gray matter volume in the hippocampal subfield and antidepressant efficacy mediated by abnormal dynamic functional connectivity\n\n# Keywords\n\nCognitive neuroscience\nComputational neuroscience\nDiseases of the nervous system\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAn abnormality of structures and functions in the hippocampus may have a key role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it is unclear whether structure factors of the hippocampus effectively impact antidepressant responses by hippocampal functional activity in MDD patients. We collected longitudinal data from 36 MDD patients before and after a 3-month course of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Additionally, we obtained baseline data from 43 healthy controls matched for sex and age. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we estimated the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) of the hippocampal subregions using a sliding-window method. The gray matter volume was calculated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The results indicated that patients with MDD exhibited significantly lower dFC of the left rostral hippocampus (rHipp.L) with the right precentral gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and left postcentral gyrus compared to healthy controls at baseline. In MDD patients, the dFC of the rHipp.L with right precentral gyrus at baseline was correlated with both the rHipp.L volume and HAMD remission rate, and also mediated the effects of the rHipp.L volume on antidepressant performance. Our findings suggested that the interaction between hippocampal structure and functional activity might affect antidepressant performance, which provided a novel insight into the hippocampus-related neurobiological mechanism of MDD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but very debilitating condition which is usually characterized by depressed mood or loss of interest along with other symptoms, including significant changes in weight or appetite, hypersomnia or insomnia, retardation or psychomotor agitation nearly every day, and feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt . As the prevalence is growing over time, MDD is ranked as the main cause of the burden of disease worldwide by WHO . The nature of the clinical disturbance may give clues during studying the neuropathology of MDD, typified by a wide-ranging but unconclusive distribution of brain alterations involved in cognitive dysfunction, emotion processing and physical symptoms . \n\nAlthough antidepressant medication (ADM) has been recommended as the first-line treatment for MDD patients, the treatment remission rate is only 30\u201340% . In most circumstances, clinicians need several weeks to examine the treatment response and determine whether to change the medical treatment plan in clinical practice, which would prolong the suffering of MDD patients . The treatment of MDD can be characterized by 3 phases: acute phase (0\u20133\u00a0months), continuation phase (4\u20139\u00a0months), and maintenance phase (\u2265\u20091\u00a0year) . Clinically, psychiatrists strive to control MDD patients' depressive symptoms within 3\u00a0months to achieve clinical cure as much as possible and promote the recovery of function to the pre-disease level. The outcome and prognosis of the disease depend on the curative in the acute phase, and 3-month is the critical time point for treatment. Therefore, exploring and predicting the improvement after 3\u00a0months of antidepressant treatment will help psychiatrists select suitable treatment schemes for the continuation phase and the maintenance phase. It will also improve the treatment remission rate of patients with MDD. A previous meta-analysis based on studies over the past 15\u00a0years has revealed that some different biomarkers have already shown their capacity to predict response to antidepressant treatment. Compared to cognition, proteins, electrophysiology or genetics, neuroimaging measures exhibited a more desirable predictive manner, and it might have reminded clinicians to refer flexibly and employ alternative treatment procedures or combination therapies on those patients who were insensitive to first-line antidepressants . \n\nThe hippocampus is a pivotal brain region that participates in a series of cognitive and affective functions . A previous meta-analysis of MDD studies found that hippocampal dysfunction was related to emotional symptoms and memory impairment . This unique role of the hippocampus on emotional memory, especially negative emotional memory, is not available in other brain regions. Meanwhile, a review using ultrahigh-field imaging indicated that the hippocampus exhibited more volumetric and structural connectivity changes than the amygdala in MDD . Therefore, we started from the hippocampus as a key focus rather than from other areas. Previous studies  have shown that long-term exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids could increase neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and cause the hippocampus to shrink and lead to impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in MDD patients, eventually resulting cognitive impairments related to the pathology . Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has revealed that a smaller hippocampal volume and anomalous hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) might cause damage in emotion regulation and memory , especially those memories related to negative emotions in MDD patients . These findings indicated that the abnormal structure and function of the hippocampus might be key components of the physiopathology of MDD. Using the hippocampus neuroimaging index as a biomarker, a previous study demonstrated that a \u2018less abnormal\u2019 hippocampal volume could predict a quicker response to antidepressants and a better treatment remission . In animal research, even after short-term treatment, antidepressant treatment has been revealed to reverse impaired neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus . However, because antidepressant treatment can significantly increase hippocampal volume and the effects might persist even after a washout period , as well as the complex relationship between hippocampal volume alteration and illness duration, it is complicated and difficult to use only hippocampal volume to predict the antidepressant efficacy. Increasingly studies have shown that the aberrant hippocampal FC has the ability to predict a poor antidepressant response after the acute phase treatment. One recent research reported the predictive value of hippocampal FC for the antidepressant treatment response after 2-week treatment , and another study indicated that the hippocampal functional connectivity patterns of brain regions between and within networks might play a pivotal role in identifying a favorable response for the 8\u00a0weeks\u2019 treatment for patients with MDD . A recent study found significant negative correlations between hippocampal volume and hippocampal FC with the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and thalamus  and it is more reliable to use FC and volume together to predict medical efficacy. \n\nHowever, previous studies mainly used static functional connectivity . Using this approach, an implicit assumption is that FC remains throughout the entire duration of the MRI scan. These time-averaged FC metrics would ignore the dynamic characteristic of MRI signals and the underlying temporal variations of FC which may supply additional information about brain activity . This temporal fluctuation of FC is referred to as dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). By using techniques of dynamic analysis, we can track the real-time activity changes in brain connectivity across different brain states. Recent evidence has demonstrated that dynamic functional connectivity can provide new information on temporal variability of rsFC and also recurring patterns of rsFC over time . Currently, in the fields of neuroscience and mental illness, more and more studies applied dFC to depict the brain alterations in some neuropsychiatric diseases including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, especially major depressive disorder . \n\nThe structural complexity and functional diversity of the hippocampus demonstrate the existence of different structural and functional subdivisions within this structure . Many studies have showed that separate hippocampal subregions have different effects on different emotional and cognitive activities . A principal theory of functional differentiation within the hippocampus suggests that the functional role of the hippocampus varies along its longitudinal axis, that is, the anterior hippocampus is responsible for emotional reactions and the posterior hippocampus contribute to cognitive functions . There is substantial evidence demonstrating that the anterior portion of the hippocampus, namely the rostral hippocampus, is highly involved in recollection of previous experience events and retrieval of unpleasant experiences, as well as modulating affective processing in particular of sadness and fear. Whereas the posterior part of the hippocampus, namely the caudal hippocampus, is related to perceptual functioning. Furthermore, encoding in episodic memory uses more anterior regions of the hippocampal formation, whereas spatial navigation utilizes more posterior regions, which suggests a specific role of the anterior hippocampus in remembering emotion-related stimuli. Evolutionary and functional neuroimaging evidence suggests that the right and left hippocampus have functional differences. Most theories suggest that the right hippocampus is more related to nonverbal and spatial functions, while the left hippocampus is more associated with verbal memory functions . One recent research illustrated that using specific subfields of the hippocampus as neuroimaging biomarkers may improve the ability to choose the best first-time treatment strategy for newly diagnosed patients with MDD . Therefore, we conjectured that, compared to using the unsubdivided whole hippocampus, employing the left rostral hippocampus might have better predictive value for antidepressant efficacy in patients with MDD. \n\nMDD is associated with smaller volume or abnormal connectivity of the hippocampus. However, the association between hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities and the impact on clinical treatment remain unclear, which may be a important research direction for the pathogenesis of MDD. Studying how the volume and dynamic functional connectivity of the left rostral hippocampus relate to the outcomes of 3-month antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD will help to reveal the role of the structure and function of the hippocampal subregion in the pathogenesis and treatment of MDD, and may provide us with more effective treatment strategies and intervention methods. In the broader context of this field, it can help us to gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD and provide theoretical support for the development of more effective treatments. \n\nIn the present research, we were to characterize the relationships among the volume of the left rostral hippocampus, the dynamic functional connectivity of the left rostral hippocampus and 3-month antidepressant pharmacotherapy outcomes for MDD patients. We hypothesized that the dFC of the left rostral hippocampus would be associated with both the volume of the left rostral hippocampus and the antidepressant efficacy, and would mediate the relationship between them. The primary goal was to search for novel evidence for the application of neuroimaging techniques in the prediction of treatment efficacy and to enrich more individualized therapy proposals for MDD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were summarized in Table  . Thirty-six MDD patients (age: 28.03\u2009\u00b1\u200910.20\u00a0years; gender: 26 females\/10 males) and forty-three healthy controls (age: 29.42\u2009\u00b1\u200912.56\u00a0years; gender: 27 females\/16 males) were included in the present study. The interviews and diagnoses of MDD patients were completed by certified psychiatrists from the Affiliated Mental Health Center of Zhejiang University School of Medicine by the Mini Neuropsychiatric International Interview (MINI) following the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The severity of depressive symptoms was evaluated by using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in subjects including MDD patients and HC. The participants who met the following criteria were excluded from this study: (1) having severe suicidal tendencies; (2) having neurological or medical illness; (3) having substance dependence; (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) having some contraindications such as with metallic implants. Following a complete written and oral explanation of this study, each subject provided written consent to participate in the study. All research procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles and were approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of Hangzhou Normal University.   \nDemographic and clinical data. \n  \nThe data were presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. \n\n HC   healthy control,   MDD   major depressive disorder;   HAMD   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale,   SSRIs   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. \n\nThe   p   value was obtained by a chi-square test; \n\nThe   p   value was obtained by a two-tailed two-sample t-test. \n  \n\n\n### Antidepressant treatment \n  \nThe longitudinal data were collected from patients with MDD before and after 3\u00a0months of antidepressant pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The medication dosages were prescribed and adjusted by the treating psychiatrists according to routine clinical practice and followed the recommended dosages ranges. After a 3-month antidepressant treatment, all MDD patients underwent an MRI scan and psychiatric assessments including HAMD evaluation again. HC participants did not take any medicine and only received the baseline MRI scan. The remission rate (RR%) was defined as (Baseline HAMD scores \u2013 3-month HAMD scores)\/Baseline HAMD scores. It should be noted that this definition of remission, with RR%, differs from the well-known definition based on HAMD scores of less than 10 or 7. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nThe imaging data of all participants were obtained using a 3.0\u00a0T Discovery MR 750 scanner (General Electric, Waukesha, WI, USA) at the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University. Participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and remain still without focusing on any specific thoughts while staying awake during the scanning process. To minimize motion artifacts, a pair of stabilizers was utilized to immobilize the participants' heads. Functional images were acquired in an interleaved manner using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence. The acquisition parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200922\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200977\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm , matrix\u2009=\u200996\u2009\u00d7\u200996, isotropic spatial resolution of 2.5\u00a0mm with 42 slices and a total of 240 volumes. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained in sagittal orientation for visualization and localization purposes using a fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (3D FSPGR): TR\u2009=\u20099\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.66\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200913\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm , matrix\u2009=\u2009300\u2009\u00d7\u2009300, 0.8\u00a0mm isotropic voxels, 176 slices without interslice gap. \n\n\n### MRI preprocessing \n  \nThe T1-weighted brain structural images were pre-processed and examined using CAT12 (Computational Anatomy Toolbox 12,  ) based on the SPM12 software ( ). CAT12 is a widely used program for performing voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. In the VBM analysis, we estimated a non-linear deformation field that can best overlays the tissue probability maps on individual participant\u2019s MRI images. The original T1-weighted images were segmented into three tissue components, including the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM), and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The overall tissue volume and total intracranial volume were calculated in the native space. Afterwards, the segmented GM images and WM images of all participants were used to create a study-specific template by using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra toolbox). The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard brain template was adopted to achieve normalization of the standard space using modulation, the voxel size for normalized images was 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u00a0mm . Finally, the modulated GM tissue segments were smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel. We obtained the smoothed and modulated GM images for each participant to be used in further statistical analysis. In order to exclude the influence of total intracranial volume on statistics, we calculated not only the absolute volume in cubic centimeters, but also the relative volume obtained by dividing the absolute volume by the total cerebral volume (TCV) including the cerebrospinal fluid volume and use them in subsequent analysis. \n\nThe processing of original rs-fMRI image data was conducted using a combination of the DPABI software (for Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging,  ) and custom code written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, United States). The first ten functional volumes of participants were discarded to allow for magnetization equilibration effects and the adaptation of the participants to the circumstances. The remaining images were corrected for time delay between slices and then realigned to the first volume for head motion correction. Throughout the entire scanning process, all participants had a maximum displacement of less than 2\u00a0mm in the x-, y-, or z-axes and an angular motion of less than 2\u00b0. To further control the confounding effects of head motion, the framewise displacement (FD) across time points was calculated for further analysis. The 3D T1-based transformation was used to perform the spatial normalization of the functional images. The 3D T1 images were co-registered to mean functional images. The corrected images were spatially normalized into the standard stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute using the transformation derived from T1 segmentation and resampled into 3-mm isotropic voxels. To further reduce the influences of confounding factors, we also regressed out the following sources: six motion parameters, white matter signal and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal. After band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1\u00a0Hz), we used the cubic spline method, specifically removing \u201cbad\u201d time points from the time series with an FD threshold of 0.5\u00a0mm, to reduce the effects of head motion . All participants\u2019 images were visually inspected for accuracy of segmentation, registration, skull stripping, and cortical surface reconstruction. \n\n\n### Sliding window dFC analysis of the left rostral hippocampus \n  \nFollowing a brain template from the Human Brainnetome Atlas Project ( ), the hippocampus in each hemisphere was divided into 4 subregions: the left rostral hippocampus,\u00a0the right rostral hippocampus, the left caudal hippocampus, and the right caudal hippocampus (Fig.\u00a0 ). To obtain the whole-brain dFC map of the left rostral hippocampus, we adopted a sliding-window approach for each subject. We used a window created by convolving a rectangle with a Gaussian (\u03c3\u2009=\u20093 TRs) and iteratively sliding each window by 1 TR (2\u00a0s). In a Gaussian window, the data at the beginning and the end of the window were downweighed. By setting the window size to 22 TRs (44\u00a0s), we obtained 209 consecutive windows for each participant. To reduce low-frequency excursions and respiratory or cardiac noise at high frequency, the rs-fMRI data of each window were temporally bandpass filtered ([0.01\u20130.1\u00a0Hz]). Within each sliding window, for each seed region of interest (ROI), we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean rs-fMRI signal of the left rostral hippocampus and signals of other voxels. The resulting correlation coefficients were converted to z-scores using the Fisher r-to-z transformation to improve normality. Therefore, we obtained 209 z-score maps for each participant, representing the whole-brain dFC fluctuation for the left rostral hippocampus. Specifically, the dFC was estimated by calculating the mean of the z maps across the 209 windows, and the resulting dFC maps were then z-standardized.   \nFour hippocampal subregions. The red cluster marked is our region of interest. Abbreviations: rHipp.L, the left rostral hippocampus. \n  \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe two-sample   t  -test was employed to analyze differences in age and HAMD scores, and the chi-square test was used to assess gender differences between the MDD and HC groups. A paired sample   t  -test was conducted to compare the baseline and post-intervention dFC or volume within the MDD group. Additionally, we performed a two-sample   t  -test to compare the difference in dFC or volume between MDD patients and HCs, with gender, age, and head movement of all participants regressed as covariates. To control for multiple comparisons, FWER corrections (family-wise error rate) with Gaussian random field theory were employed with the voxel threshold set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 and the cluster threshold set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.0125 (0.05\/4). Furthermore, we carried out Pearson correlation analysis in the MDD group to explore the relationship between the neuroimaging findings (dFC and volume) and clinical characteristics (HAMD). \n\nTo investigate whether the influence of the left rostral hippocampal volume on antidepressant efficacy was mediated by its abnormal dFC, a mediation analysis based on a standard three-variable mediation model was performed. The independent variable was the relative volume of the left rostral hippocampus, the mediator was its dFC, and the dependent variable was the antidepressant efficacy after a 3-month treatment. The significance of the mediation effect was assessed using bootstrapping method and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CI) in PROCESS macro (V4) for SPSS (version 25; IBM SPSS Inc.). A confidence interval that does not contain zero means that there exists a significant mediation effect for the proposed mediating factor. \n\n\n### Ethical approval \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Hangzhou Normal University. \n\n\n### Informed consent \n  \nThe patients\/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Altered dynamic functional connectivity pattern of the left rostral hippocampus in MDD \n  \nCompared with HC, patients with MDD showed statistically significant decreased dFC of the left rostral hippocampus (rHipp.L) with three brain regions including the right precentral gyrus (PreCG.R,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0125, FWE-corrected; peak MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u200948, y\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20099, z\u2009=\u200957, t\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095.03, cluster size\u2009=\u2009374 voxels), postcentral\u2002gyrus (PoCG.L,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) and left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Thereinto, the case\u2013control comparison results of the dFC between the rHipp.L and PreCG.R were shown in Fig.\u00a0 . There were significant differences in the dFC of the rHipp.L with the PreCG.R between MDD patients at baseline and HC (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), as well as between MDD patients after 3-month antidepressant treatment and HC (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01). There were no significant differences in the volume of the rHipp.L between MDD and HC (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05).   \n(  a  ) Between-group differences of the relative volume of rHiopp.L; (  b  ) Between-group differences mean dFC of rHipp.L with PreCG.R.

Further mediation analysis found that this dFC of the rHipp.L could significantly mediate the relationship between the relative volume of the rHipp.L and HAMD remission rate in MDD patients. Our results revealed that when the rHipp.L relative volume was examined as a possible predicting factor, the total effect c\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.111, the direct effect c\u2019\u2009=\u20090.007 (95% CI [\u2212\u2009580.12, 604.2]), the indirect effect c\u2013c\u2019\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.118 (95% CI [\u2212\u20090.387, \u2212\u20090.003]) the dFC between rHipp.L and PreCG.

We mainly focused on the effect of the left rostral hippocampal region on antidepressant pharmacotherapy responses for MDD. The results showed that the dFC of the left rostral hippocampal subregion mediated the relationship between the hippocampal volume and antidepressant efficacy. The findings advanced our understanding of how the hippocampus affects the treatment effects and provided potential biomarkers for treatment prediction and evaluations in MDD. \n\nMany studies have provided consistent evidence of the importance of the hippocampus in the development or treatment of MDD . Hippocampal volume is proposed as a potentially useful neuroimaging biomarker of treatment sensitivity to antidepressant. One recent research  revealed that increased hippocampal tail volume could predict depression status and remission to antidepressant medications in MDD, and another research  reported smaller left and right hippocampal volumes in patients with MDD. These findings suggested the importance of using VBM analysis to explore the volume of specific hippocampal subregions. The dFC provided a new tool for exploring the neurophysiological mechanism of MDD. One previous study  has also demonstrated altered dFC variability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and large-scale functional networks in MDD patients. These findings prompted us that the combined use of VBM and dFC analysis might provide novel understandings of MDD pathology. Therefore, VBM analysis and seed-based dFC analysis were two interrelated analytical methods employed in this study. \n\nIn our present research, MDD patients showed lower dFC in the PoCG.L, STG.L and PreCG.R when using the rHipp.L as a seed compared with HC. The next correlation analysis showed that the dFC between the rHipp.L and PreCG.R was significantly negatively correlated to the remission rate of HAMD, which confirmed previous research. The precentral gyrus is the site of the main somatosensory cortex of the human brain that is highly involved in some pivotal cognitive activities, including working memory , implicit learning  and motor learning . The abnormalities in the structure and function of the precentral gyrus in MDD patients have been revealed in many neuroimaging studies . In addition, superior control-related activation of the precentral gyrus is associated with suicide risk in MDD patients . Therefore, we have reason to assume that the aberrant dFC between rHipp.L and PreCG.R leads to abnormally excessive suicidal beliefs and suicidal behaviors in MDD patients. Furthermore, the gray matter volume of the precentral gyrus in MDD patients may be related to avoidance motivation, which is one of the most significant characteristics of MDD patients . Most importantly, this was found to be associated with negative attribution bias . Internal attributions of events, where the self is viewed as an active intentional agent, involve PreCG. Aberrant activation of PreCG may lead MDD patients to use fewer \u201cself-service\u201d attribution manners than HC, which may explain the feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt in MDD patients. According to previous studies , treatment with escitalopram for 8\u00a0weeks was found to relate to the FC abnormalities in the hippocampus and precuneus, and SSRI administration was also reported to decreased the FC of the hippocampus with the prefrontal cortex. Our findings, together with previous studies, suggested that the left hippocampus might be a target for rapid antidepressant action, which requires further study for verification. \n\nFurther correlation analysis revealed that the dFC between PreCG.R and rHipp.L was significantly positively correlated to the relative volume of rHipp.L. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the hippocampal volume: the neuroplasticity hypothesis and the neurogenesis hypothesis . The neuroplasticity hypothesis addresses that the hippocampal volume decreased due to the shortening of dendrites and a reduction in the number and density of spines. The Neurogenesis hypothesis resolves the issue that the hippocampal volume is decreased by the decrease of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These two hypotheses assume that, whether from the perspective of morphological changes of hippocampal neurons or from the perspective of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, as the hippocampus shrinks in patients with MDD, the connectivity of the hippocampus also decreases, which is verified by our results. \n\nIt was worth noting that there were no significant differences between the relative volume of rHipp.L in MDD patients at baseline, after 3-month antidepressant treatment, and HC. Although this appears to be a consensus regarding the abnormalities of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis observed in MDD patients, and the hippocampus has been suggested as a suprahypothalamic regulator involved in the negative feedback control of cortisol , higher levels of cortisol may induce neuronal damage in the hippocampus, leading to hippocampal shrinkage. But changes of the hippocampal volume in MDD patients are still a topic of debate. Although smaller hippocampal volume in MDD relative to HC was more frequently reported, some studies have come up with different results. One recent research  revealed that larger hippocampal tail volume was associated with both a diagnosis of MDD and remission to antidepressant drugs, another study  found no differences between the hippocampal volume of nonpsychiatric healthy controls and MDD patients. In our present research, no significant differences were found. This may be the result of a mixed effect of many factors, such as the long illness duration, medication effect and MDD patients\u2019 age. This complicated relationship should be further examined in the future. Fewer neurons or glia may result in smaller hippocampal volume in MDD patients. However, the density of CA1 pyramidal neurons increases with the duration of illness, and the number of dentate gyrus granule cells and glial cells increases with age, leaving no significant changes in hippocampal volume. Therefore, we considered that the changes in hippocampal volume was the result of a mixed effect of many factors such as the long illness duration, medication effect and MDD patients\u2019 age, and this complicated relationship should be further examined in the future. \n\nAfter the mediation analysis, the dFC was found to significantly mediate the relationship between the relative volume of rHipp.L and antidepressant efficacy. Because we found abnormal dFC at baseline in MDD patients, and no significant differences in rHipp.L volume were found in group comparisons. It is reasonable to assume that the dFC abnormalities might precede structural abnormalities, suggesting that these imaging phenotypes may indicate distinct stages of cognitive impairment in MDD patients. One study indicated that antidepressant drugs may reverse both the neurogenesis modifications and the impaired neuroplasticity in the hippocampus, such as loss of glial cells and dendritic atrophy , which may normalize the shrunken hippocampus. More importantly, many studies  have proved that after different phases of antidepressant treatment, even only two weeks, the FC using the hippocampus as a seed improved to varying degrees. We proposed that such a normalization process in the hippocampal connectivity may lead to a beneficial impact on emotional regulation functions and cognitive ability in MDD patients. At the same time, these findings further proved the importance of using dFC as a mediation variable to explore the relationship between the specific hippocampal subregion volume and antidepressant efficacy. \n\nSeveral limitations of our present research should be solved. Firstly, the antidepressant treatment effect in the present study was for pharmacological treatment and the treatment effect of other treatment protocols is worthy of being studied carefully. Secondly, the sample size of MDD patients was relatively small and there was a gender ratio discrepancy between MDD and HC participants, which might reduce the generalizability of the work, and our study should be regarded as a pilot study. Future longitudinal studies with large sample sizes and patients with various clinical features are needed to recapitulate the results of our study before they can be applied in clinical practice. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study revealed the abnormal dFC between the PreCG.R and rHipp.L in MDD patients, although no volume changes have yet been detected. Furthermore, the dFC mediated the relationship between the rHipp.L volume and antidepressant efficacy, suggesting that there exists temporal dynamics of hippocampal functional and structural alterations during the disease progression of MDD patients. Most importantly, our research showed that a combination of volume and abnormal dFC yielded higher discriminative value in predicting antidepressant efficacy in MDD patients compared with either alone. Our present research revealed the importance of the volume and dFC of specific hippocampal subfield as a neuroimaging biomarker, and provided new evidence supporting the application of neuroimaging techniques in the treatment outcome prediction, thus guiding a more individualized treatment strategy for MDD patients. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11026377,"text_md5":"522d6a9f27266e0b4048804c2661cc50","field_positions":{"authors":[0,99],"journal":[100,107],"publication_year":[109,113],"title":[124,275],"keywords":[289,370],"abstract":[383,1880],"body":[1889,35384]},"batch":1,"pmid":38637536,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-024-56866-w","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11026377","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11026377"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11026377\">11026377<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11026377  The association between gray matter volume in the hippocampal subfield and antidepressant efficacy mediated by abnormal dynamic functional connectivity"}

While rsfMRI holds unparalleled promise in systems neurosciences, its acquisition and analytical methodology across research groups is variable, resulting in a literature that is challenging to integrate and interpret. The focus of this narrative review is to address the primary methodological issues including investigator decision points in the application of rsfMRI to study the consequences of TBI. As part of the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group, we have collaborated to identify a minimum set of recommendations that are designed to produce results that are reliable, harmonizable, and reproducible for the TBI imaging research community. Part one of this review provides the results of a literature search of current rsfMRI studies of TBI, highlighting key design considerations and data processing pipelines. Part two outlines seven data acquisition, processing, and analysis recommendations with the goal of maximizing study reliability and between-site comparability, while preserving investigator autonomy. Part three summarizes new directions and opportunities for future rsfMRI studies in TBI patients. The goal is to galvanize the TBI community to gain consensus for a set of rigorous and reproducible methods, and to increase analytical transparency and data sharing to address the reproducibility crisis in the field. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has provided neuroscientists with a powerful tool to model synchronous low-frequency oscillations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal as an apparent measure of brain activity patterns ( ,  ). Resting-state fMRI eliminates task demands and typically shortens scan times, making it easier to use with cognitively impaired participants who may have difficulty sustaining attention or completing complex fMRI tasks while in the scanner (e.g.,  ). In the first application of rsfMRI to brain injury,   performed whole-brain network analyses of the rsfMRI signal in 8 patients at 3\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months following severe TBI. Their results revealed alterations of network properties including enhanced functional connectivity (FC) early after injury that became more comparable to healthy adults over the course of the first 6\u00a0months post injury. Since this initial study, more than 100 rsfMRI studies have been published in TBI patients with a particular surge in contributions in the most recent years. The scope, methodology, and utility of rsfMRI in TBI has been reviewed in previous review papers (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). For example,   summarized findings from both structural, diffusion, and rsfMRI studies to examine how brain networks are disrupted by axonal injury. In another review,   reviewed alterations to graph theoretical properties of the functional brain networks in TBI patients, outlining pertinent methodological challenges associated with the examination of FC in these patients. \n\nDespite the breadth of empirical work examining rsfMRI changes after TBI, the literature has yet to coalesce around a consistent set of findings. Efforts for meaningful   meta  -analyses have been unsuccessful ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ) and were at least partially the inspiration for this critical review. For example,   recently concluded that there were no consistent findings in TBI and rsfMRI. Another   meta  -analysis by   demonstrated that FC within the default-mode network showed consistent associations with cognitive performance in all types of acute onset brain injury and was associated with worse cognition. However, this consistent finding was only found in four studies in TBI and stroke patients. Inconsistent results across studies pose critical challenges to the field and hinder progress towards clinical and diagnostic applications of rsfMRI. With the effects of the replication crisis now observable in virtually every discipline in science, there is increasing concern regarding the reproducibility of TBI research ( ). \n\nThe methods used in rsfMRI have not been spared from this scrutiny, with several reviews outlining the challenges of reproducibility in the rsfMRI literature in both basic ( ,  ) and applied neurosciences ( ). There has been growing concern about the reliability of rsfMRI methods and how they might be appropriately applied to the study of TBI across basic (cognitive neuroscience) and applied (neurorehabilitation) topics. For example, in a review of 106 rsfMRI studies in the clinical neurosciences (including TBI), more than 50 brain parcellation schemes were utilized to create networks for analysis, rendering the literature nearly impossible to integrate and interpret ( ). The wide range of pathways for data analysis results in a decentralized implementation of rsfMRI procedures, with low methodological overlap, poor harmonizability, and conflicting interpretations. For example, when 70 investigators were asked to test the same hypotheses on the same imaging data set, no two teams chose an identical analysis workflow: thus, the investigators\u2019 results were highly discrepant ( ). Concerns about researcher degrees of freedom ( ) and under-powered studies ( ) are now being voiced, refocusing attention on maximizing reliability in rsfMRI studies ( ). Unfortunately, the problem of \u201cforking paths\u201d (which refers to investigator freedom to choose from myriad analytical approaches) that   discuss, appears trivial when compared to the massive parameter space facing investigators using rsfMRI. When considering only the   pre-processing   of data,   show that there are more than 60,000 pathways to analyze data using accepted procedures. There is an urgent need to reconcile inconsistent findings in rsfMRI studies (see  ;  ), a seemingly impossible task in the face of methodological divergence of this magnitude. \n\nThis reproducibility crisis is more pronounced when studying patients with TBI due to the heterogeneity in brain injuries. TBI can result from different causes (such as traffic accidents, falls, assaults, blast explosions), leading to diverse lesion types, locations and sizes across TBI patients ( ). This variability in lesion characteristics can result in inconsistencies in resting state networks and other diverse patterns of FC across patients, making it challenging to identify reproducible findings across rsfMRI studies in TBI patients ( ). There is also a high between-subject variability in brain reorganization mechanisms (i.e., differences in restoration and compensation mechanism) across TBI patients, which can lead to differences in FC patterns ( ). Patients with TBI can present with a wide range of cognitive and motor deficits, potentially increasing head motion during fMRI scans ( ;  ). This can introduce artifacts and spurious correlations in the data and reduce the quality of the rsfMRI data, impacting the reproducibility of results. The majority of rsMRI studies in TBI patients have low sample sizes with insufficient statistical power, impacting the generalizability. There are several strategies that TBI researchers can employ to enhance reproducibility of rsfMRI studies, which will help improve the reliability and generalizability of findings in this challenging population. \n\nOne approach to address issues of reproducibility is to identify a minimum set of recommended methods that are reliable, harmonizable, and reproducible within the TBI imaging research community.\u00a0  The primary focus of this review is to galvanize the TBI research community in favor of an agreed-upon set of reproducible methods.   We aim to increase analytical transparency and data sharing to address long-standing methodological challenges in the field, while preserving investigators\u2019 freedom to choose methods appropriate to their empirical questions. To achieve this, we will outline the following seven recommendations (see   for an overview) to improve the reproducibility of rsfMRI studies in TBI patients: (i) account for heterogeneity in TBI sample characteristics; (ii) share data to boost sample sizes, increase representativeness, and address heterogeneity; (iii) utilize a minimum set of rsfMRI sequence acquisition parameters; (iv) standardize quality assessment procedures of rsfMRI data; (v) employ consistent approaches for head motion correction and nuisance signal regression; (vi) standardize procedures for dealing with lesions in moderate-to-severe TBI patients; and (vii) use standardized data processing workflows for pre- and post-processing analyses. These seven recommendations should serve as a useful reference for those TBI researchers who are new to rsfMRI analysis, helping them to avoid \u2018analysis paralysis\u2019 in the face of tens of thousands of highly technical methodological decisions, and as a check for those who may already be running studies, but may have overlooked some important confounds. In   part 1,   we provide an overview of 181 currently published rsfMRI studies in TBI, focusing on their design choices and processing techniques. In   part 2,   we offer a set of recommendations for best practices, supported by key literature. In cases where no solutions are obvious, we highlight and chart important goals for their future resolution. Finally, in   part 3  , we outline new directions and opportunities for future rsfMRI studies in TBI patients, including multimodal MRI studies, lesion mapping strategies, and single-subject analyses.   \nSchematic overview of the seven recommendations from the ENIGMA rsfMRI working group. \n  \n\n\n## Part 1: Summary of the studies \n  \nFor this narrative review, we aimed to understand the methods used in rsfMRI studies of TBI, so a basic search strategy was conducted using Ovid Medline to retrieve rsfMRI studies in TBI patients. The search strategy used alternative terms for TBI (\u201ctraumatic brain injur*\u201d OR \u201cTBI\u201d OR \u201cmoderate to severe TBI\u201d OR \u201csevere TBI\u201d or \u201cconcussion\u201d) AND rsfMRI (\u201crsfMRI\u201d or \u201cfunctional connect*\u201d OR \u201cfunctional network\u201d OR \u201cconnect*\u201d OR \u201cgraph theory\u201d). The search strategy was further refined by limiting the results to studies carried out in human populations and excluding review papers. After this initial search, duplicates were manually removed, and remaining results were screened and reviewed in the full-text format for relevance and quality. Because the primary goal was to understand investigators' methods\/approaches in this literature, inclusion of studies was also based on the co-authors\u2019 expertise and familiarity with the rsfMRI literature. One hundred eighty-one research articles (153 in mild and 28 in moderate-to-severe TBI) met the search criteria. \n\nTo critique the methods used in this literature, we documented the key study parameters of each study (such as sample size, acquisition parameters, pre-and post-processing techniques) in the Supplementary Table. This Table provide an overview of the methodological issues that can affect the reliability of rsfMRI results in TBI patients. These results were used to guide our set of recommendations to improve the reproducibility of rsfMRI studies, which are outlined in  . \n\nIn the 181 studies reviewed in this paper, different approaches were used to examine resting-state brain activity in TBI patients (see Supplementary Table). The majority of the studies (86 studies) have used a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, whereby a seed region is selected a priori, and the subsequent FC map is extracted from the temporal correlations between the ROI and all other brain regions. Fifty-six studies applied network analyses or graph theory on the resting-state fMRI data. Thirty-six papers have employed the independent component analysis (ICA) method, whereby the data for the entire brain is decomposed into a set number of components, each of which is depicted as a functional map. Only a few ICA studies evaluated resting-state FC differences of the same canonical network, including the default mode network (6 studies), task-positive network (2 studies), salience network (2 studies), fronto-parietal network (2 studies). Twelve studies extracted voxel-wise quantitative features from the rsfMRI data, such as the regional homogeneity (ReHo, 3 studies), in TBI patients. The remaining studies used either one of these methods in combination with other analysis techniques, or a completely different approach, such as principal component analysis (PCA, 4 studies), multi-voxel pattern analysis (MPVA, 2 studies), Bayesian multi-subject vector autoregressive modelling (BVAR, 1 study), and cross-correlational analysis (CCA, 1 study). This variability in the analysis characteristics varied so greatly that it was impossible for us to perform a   meta  -analysis. \n\n\n## Part 2: Recommendations \n  \n### Account for heterogeneity in sample characteristics \n  \nIt is critical to account for heterogeneity in patients with TBI when attempting to categorize injury-based rsfMRI connectivity alterations. More so than in other brain disorders, TBI patients present with a wide range of injury characteristics and individual factors that can result in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) fluctuations ( ). However, 57.46% of studies in our review had sample sizes less than 30 (see Supplementary Table), resulting in conclusions that may not be generalizable within and across different populations. Focused attention is required to address how myriad effects ranging from demographics to clinical injury variables influence modeling and ultimately the reproducibility of rsfMRI results. A total of 7, 392 participants were studied across all papers included in the review. Mild TBI, as opposed to moderate-severe TBI, accounts for over 90% of the population studied. \n\nMales commonly show higher rates of TBI ( ) and have greater representation in the studied population (68.87%). Perhaps due to less representation of women, 90.06% of studies did not report including sex as a covariate in post-processing analyses. Sex remains a critical variable of study with studies now showing that females have higher rates of sports-related concussion in sex comparable sports ( ,  ,  ). Because of this, there is growing emphasis in examining sex differences in both the biological response to injury as well as in the study of long-term outcome. As one example, epidemiological data suggest sex differences in recovery trajectories for both sports-related ( ) and non-sports related ( ) concussions. Moreover, studies have demonstrated sex differences in cognitive functioning for both acute ( ,  ) and chronic TBI stages ( ,  ,  ). Biological older adult males are more likely to show decreases in rsFC six months after mild TBI, compared to similar age females ( ). Others have pointed to sexual dimorphism of brain morphometry including axonal structure as a source of between-sex difference in symptom presentation and recovery following TBI ( ). While this literature continues to emerge, there is ample evidence that investigating the biological basis for recovery of TBI requires consideration of biological sex, and work to date has only begun to do so. \n\nWith respect to age, the majority of studies in our review (70.59%) recruited mostly adult TBI patients (> 21\u00a0years). TBI rates increase with age ( ), and older adults are at greater risk of hospitalization after TBI ( ). Older age at injury is a risk factor for significant rsFC alterations, which underlie common post-traumatic cognitive deficits ( ). Physiologically and anatomically, brain injury during development is vastly different to that during adulthood ( ), making extrapolation of results between age groups inappropriate. Thus, studies should either examine TBI patients according to constrained age ranges, or age should be included as a covariate in all analyses. \n\nOf the reviewed studies, ethnicity and\/or race were not reported as covariates in any post-processing analyses. Ethnicity is known to affect TBI risk, treatment, and functional outcomes. In addition to having greater risk of sustaining a TBI ( ,  ), Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to receive treatment post-TBI ( ) and to be discharged to rehabilitation ( ,  ,  ,  ) relative to White patients. Representation of non-White persons with TBI in the literature is a critical issue as well as the lack of representation of premorbid psychiatric history, homelessness, and substance abuse even though those groups are over-represented in the population of head injury as it naturally occurs (see  ,  ) These longstanding issues with regard to representativeness must be addressed for generalizability of results; social and biological determinants of health have clear influence on TBI outcome and should be directly modeled. \n\nTime post injury is a critical determinant of system-level plasticity, yet it was modeled in the analysis of only 4.42% of studies. Time since injury is a critical factor to consider in understanding recovery trajectories and has been shown to be vital in the understanding of network plasticity. There is evidence that rsFC connectomics may change over time during the first year post injury, with increases in rsFC found at 6-months, 1-year, and 18-months after injury in adult patients with mild, moderate, and severe TBI ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ;  ). Other studies have shown limited changes in rsFC between 3 and 5\u00a0months after injury ( ), as well as heterogeneous patterns of altered whole-brain connectivity at the chronic stage ( ,  ). \n\nAccounting for important demographic and clinical differences such as injury severity, sex, age, ethnicity, and time since injury when analyzing rsFC after TBI is crucial. Where possible, these variables could be included as covariates in rsfMRI models to understand their influence on network metrics. There have been recent calls to redefine our science with focus on better isolating and defining features that comprise our samples ( ). In other areas of the behavioral sciences there has been a call for a \u201cheterogeneity revolution\u201d ( ) in order to address contextual differences in groups \u2013 an issue critical to the understanding of TBI and interventions designed to improve outcome. Reliable rsfMRI findings will require that the next generation of studies can define their TBI samples using Common Data Elements (CDEs) or standardized assessments for assessing demographic and clinical characteristics of the TBI patients. For example, a combination of CDEs is commonly utilized to assess TBI severity ( ), including injury-related measures (such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, duration of Posttraumatic Amnesia (PTA) assessed using tools such as the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test or Westmead PTA scale), clinical assessments (using standardized tools, such as the Injury Severity Score or Abbreviated Injury Score), imaging findings using CT or MRI scans at the time of injury (such as number of lesions, type of lesions, midline shift), or biomarkers (such as levels of axonal markers). Standardizing the collection of these data elements will enhance the comparability of TBI assessments across rs-fMRI studies and facilitate data-sharing (as discussed in the next section). It will contribute to the development of comprehensive databases for advancing TBI research and enable the conduct of   meta  -analyses. \n\n\n### Share data to boost sample sizes, increase representativeness, and address heterogeneity \n  \nThe rsfMRI TBI literature reviewed here is composed primarily of samples that are heterogeneous with respect to demographics and injury characteristics. Functional imaging studies are uniformly under-powered (see  ,  ). Our Supplementary Table reveal consistently small sample sizes (< 30, an arbitrarily chosen cut-off to suggest low sample size) across the reviewed papers. The reasons for these shortfalls are many, including challenges with participant enrollment, and in longitudinal studies, retainment, MRI contraindications, and financial expense. Data sharing holds new opportunities to address long-standing problems with under-powered studies and heterogeneity in demographic and clinical factors in TBI that have undoubted influence on patient outcome. Opportunities through team science and data sharing now make this possible ( ). For example, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Brain Injury working group (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) has addressed the inconsistent neuroimaging findings in TBI by aggregating MRI data from TBI patients across multiple sites to obtain sufficient power to reliably conduct analyses on MRI data. As one example,   have recently conducted a mega-analysis of rsfMRI data from 1, 024 obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and 1, 028 healthy controls from 28 independent samples of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. Their images were analyzed using HALFpipe (Harmonized AnaLysis of Functional MRI pipeline) ( ), which is an fMRIPrep-based analytical tool modified for the clinical neurosciences ( ). HALFPipe follows standardized protocols to standardize data processing, increase data fidelity, and harmonize data across multiple sites (see  ). Their mega-analysis revealed several rsFC differences between people with OCD and healthy matched controls, showing global hypo-connectivity across networks, most prominently in the sensorimotor network, as well as fewer hyper-connections, mostly pertaining to the thalamus. A similar coordinated analysis of rsfMRI data of TBI patients across multiple cohorts of the ENIGMA TBI working group with standardized pipelines is ongoing and may help to address issues of sample heterogeneity and provide novel insights into system-level plasticity and convergence in findings. \n\nA fundamental concern for data sharing and collaborative science is the need to protect participants\u2019 privacy. Researchers need to employ techniques like anonymization, removing personally identifiable information, and implementing strict access controls (see critical reviews,  ,  ). Additionally, establishing data-sharing agreements and obtaining informed consent with clear privacy provisions are crucial steps in safeguarding participants\u2019 confidentiality. To anonymize rsfMRI data investigators should consider applying de-identification software (e.g., Conquest DICOM software, DICOM library, DICOMworks) to automatically scrub   meta  -data from the DICOM data, to ensure that the sensitive information is eliminated ( ). Investigators should use MR defacing algorithms (such as afni_refacer, deepdefacer, mri_deface, mridefacer, etc) to remove facial features, preserving anonymity of the participants ( ). Structural anonymizing (defacing) is standard for BIDS format as well. The use of   meta  -data or aggregating data to a higher level (e.g., group averages) can minimize the risk of re-identifications. For example, HALFpipe enables users to tackle consortium analyses of multi\u2010cohort fMRI data by running a standardized analysis protocol (preprocessing and feature extraction) at each site and\/or cohort prior to sharing the derived maps and summary statistics to perform group level statistics ( ). \n\n\n### Utilize a minimum set of rsfMRI acquisition parameters \n  \nThe Supplementary Table displays the variability in sequence parameters for rsfMRI data acquisition across the reviewed studies. Resting-state fMRI acquisition parameters depend on several factors, including scanner hardware (field strength, type of radiofrequency coils, gradient strength) and software, and studies\u2019 research questions. However, scanning parameters must be carefully considered and optimized to obtain reliable and reproducible rsfMRI data in TBI patients. In multisite TBI studies, MRI physicists can approximate sequence parameters for different scanners. Also, scanning parameters should be consistently reported: many important parameters, including the resting state condition (eyes closed 41%, eyes open 18%, eyes open with fixation point 13%), were not reported in 40% of the publications (Supplementary Table). While a single set of parameters is unlikely to meet the goals for all investigators, we propose a range of acceptable and literature-driven acquisition parameters (in alignment with the scanning protocol of the Human Connectome Project, see  ) that should be considered when conducting resting state fMRI studies in TBI patients, such as the field strength, scan duration, spatial resolution, and repetition time. We refer the interested reader to a review paper by  , which provides an overview of recommendations for rsfMRI acquisition strategies for a range of applications, from the most common approaches for rsfMRI acquisition strategies, to more recent rsfMRI studies with dedicated scanner hardware and ultra-high field scanners. \n\nIn our review, the majority of the rsfMRI studies were conducted on 3T scanners (approximately 95%; see Supplementary Table). Only 8 studies out of 181 employed 1.5T scanners (and no studies were performed on ultra-high field scanners, such as 7T). Even though high-field MRI scanners (3T or more) increase the risk of susceptibility artifacts, they are preferred for rsfMRI studies as they provide better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a higher spatial resolution ( ). The scan duration should be long enough to capture the resting-state fluctuations in the BOLD signal, but short enough to avoid fatigue in the participants ( ,  ,  ). Resting-state fMRI scans typically lasted between 4.1 and 20\u00a0min (mean: 7.19\u00a0min). However, TBI researchers should consider a minimum of 13\u00a0min (for group-based analyses;  ) and a minimum of 25\u00a0min (for single-subject analyses,  ; see also  ) to improve the reliability of the rsfMRI scan in TBI patients. This length of the scan duration increases the risk of head motion. Therefore, it is important to consider to minimise head motion through the following steps: (i) advanced motion correction procedures (see  ); (ii) practice sessions in a mock scanner before the actual scanning session if available and (iii) administer two runs (6\u00a0min 30 each) of rsfMRI; and (iv) employ multiband acceleration factors (e.g., a multiband factor between 2 and 4) to acquire multiple slices simultaneously ( ,  ). \n\nAs can be seen in the Supplementary Table, repetition time (TR) ranged between 460 and 6565\u00a0ms (mean 2041\u00a0ms). We recommend a TR\u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u00a0s as a minimum in future studies (e.g.,  ;  ;  ,  ), which is feasible on most scanners used in standard clinical practice. Scans with a very short TR [< 1000\u00a0ms (range\u00a0=\u00a0460\u2013\u2013\u2013900\u00a0ms); as in the studies by  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] can capture more rapid changes in the signal and provide a better sampling of physiological noise (from respiration and cardiac pulsation) that can then be filtered out ( ,  ). These fast rsfMRI scans allow the exploration of dynamic and transient brain states that change over shorter time intervals (see critical reviews by  ;  ). \n\nThe range of spatial resolutions (i.e., voxel size) common across rsfMRI studies of TBI was between 1.2\u00a0mm  and 4\u00a0mm  (see Supplementary Table). A small isotropic voxel size (e.g., 2.5\u00a0mm ) is optimal as it provides higher spatial resolution and reduces partial volume effects (Raimando et al., 2021;  ). Moreover, a large field of view (FOV) (e.g., 250\u00a0mm\u00a0x\u00a0250\u00a0mm) and many slices (50\u201370) are ideal, as they reduce the spatial aliasing and increase the SNR, although the additional collection time might be considered for patient tolerance. Several rsfMRI studies in TBI cropped the cerebellum; however, this subcortical region is very important in TBI impairment and recovery, therefore this practice is best avoided ( ,  ). It is also recommended to acquire fieldmaps or additional (two or more) reverse phase encoded spin echo images for distortion correction ( ). \n\nAs can be seen in the Supplementary Table, there is high variability across rsfMRI studies in terms of acquisition of rsfMRI data with eyes open (e.g.,  ,  ), eyes fixated on a crosshair (e.g.,  ,  ), or eyes closed (e.g.,  ;  ). Although these conditions produce comparable FC results, several studies have shown that acquiring rsfMRI data with eyes fixated on a cross may reduce variability (more control of eye movements), show greater reliability of within-network connections ( ,  ), and show more significant correlations with demographic and behavioral variables ( ). Recent work ( ,  ) has also demonstrated the benefits of collecting rsfMRI data while participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching abstract shapes (e.g.,  ), instead of fixating on a crosshair. These studies have revealed that naturalistic-stimulus-derived FC predicted individual brain activity and cognitive traits more accurately than rs-derived FC, and improved participant compliance related to motion and wakefulness. These naturalistic stimuli will provide a powerful tool of studying brain organization in TBI patients. Finally, it is also important to consider to monitor physiological parameters (such as respiration and heart rate) and eye tracking of the TBI patients during the rsfMRI acquisition, which can be corrected for during the preprocessing of the rsfMRI data. \n\n\n### Standardize quality assessment procedures of rsfMRI data \n  \nBesides optimizing rsfMRI acquisition protocols, it is crucial to ensure the quality of the data to obtain meaningful and reliable results. As seen in the Supplementary Table, several studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0115) did not report performing quality assessment steps on the rsfMRI data. Quality assessment of rsfMRI data will ensure that the acquired fluctuations in the BOLD signal truly reflect biological signals of interest and are not contaminated by noise or artifacts, such as head motion, physiological noise, high intensity wrap-around, scanner drift, susceptibility-related artifacts ( ,  ,  ). While quality of the raw data is assessed in many laboratories, the details of the assessments are not always reported, possibly because conventions are lacking for reporting types of data quality checks and the measures to be reported. Further, there is a risk of assessment of the quality of preprocessed data being overlooked when using pipelines. We suggest details on all quality assessment measures be included in manuscripts. High-quality rsfMRI data leads to more robust findings and enhances the reproducibility of results of FC patterns in TBI patients, which allows different research groups to compare and validate rsfMRI findings in future   meta  -analyses. \n\nTherefore, it is very important to conduct quality assessment steps on the raw and preprocessed rsfMRI data. Several tools are available that allow users to perform both visual inspection and extraction of quality metrics, such as the configurable pipeline for the analysis of connectome C\u2010PAC ( ), the Conn toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) ( ), ENIGMA HALFpipe ( ), the eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline XCP ( ), the data processing and analysis of brain images toolbox DPABI ( ), fMRIPrep ( ), Magnetic Resonance Imaging Quality Control tool (MRIQC) ( ), FitLins ( ), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software suite ( ), and SPM ( ). There are several quality metrics that can be used to distinguish and quantify distinct noise sources in BOLD signal, which can typically be classified into separate domains based on criteria related to their ability to capture spatial versus temporal properties of fMRI time series. In  , we present motion quality metrics in two mild TBI patients (one with (bad) and one without (good) the presence of motion artifact) generated by the ENIGMA HALFpipe using the default pre-processing steps and quality assessment criteria (see   for a detailed manual). Of note, these quality metrics are often interrelated, so they potentially represent a common basis set for the TBI field to use in determining image quality moving forward.   \nEPI Confounds output from a HALFpipe QC report for two mild TBI patients with good (top) and bad (bottom) data (from an ongoing study led by KC). Displayed are time courses (x-axis) of the magnitude (y-axis) of the global signal (GS), global signal in CSF (GSCSF) and white matter (GSWM), DVARS (D: temporal derivative of time courses; VARS: RMS variance over voxels) and the framewise displacement (FD). The time courses are followed by a carpet plot, a two-dimensional heatmap of the BOLD time series, with time on the x-axis and voxels on the y-axis. Voxels are arranged into cortical (blue) and subcortical (orange) grey matter, cerebellum (green), and white matter and cerebro-spinal fluid (red). QC involves looking for fluctuations in intensity in the carpet plot with reference to motion and signal changes in the time courses. Sudden changes in the carpet plot are likely to be caused by abrupt movement, whereas prolonged signal changes may be indicative of motion or acquisition artifacts. Sustained and substantial changes in the carpet plot of TBI03 (red arrows), particularly around the halfway mark, corresponding to changes in the time courses of all other quality metrics (with a maximum FD\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0mm), are associated with movement (determined by visual inspection). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nIn addition to using visual inspection to check for artifacts in raw data, three types of visual inspection of preprocessed data that are commonly used are: (i) Visual inspection of the skull stripping of the anatomical image (to make sure that there are no portions of the brain missing or too much of the skull retained); (ii) Visual inspection of the registration of the anatomical scan to the MNI space (to ensure there is no misalignment between the MNI template and the anatomical scan); and (iii) Visual inspection of the registration of the EPI image to MNI space (to ensure there is no misalignment between the MNI template and the EPI). \n\nTemporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) of the rs-fMRI data is a measure of the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the signal over time (with higher tSNR indicating better data quality). Global signal (GS) is the average time series of all brain voxels. Drastic fluctuations or outliers in the GS might be indicative of physiological noise or artifacts. DVARS, which is the temporal change in root-mean-square intensity (with D referring to the temporal derivative of the time course and VARS corresponding to the root-mean-square variance over all voxels), indicates the change in BOLD signal across the whole brain at each volume relative to the previous volume ( ). It therefore provides insight into the relationship between the BOLD signal and movement. \n\nExcessive head motion is a common issue in rsfMRI studies in TBI patients as it can introduce spurious correlations or impair the detection of significant ones. Subject motion can be assessed by examining the motion parameters obtained during the preprocessing step (see also  ). The above-mentioned software packages provide quality metrics related to motion correction, which can be used to identify and exclude volumes and participants with excessive motion from the analysis. Quality assessment of motion was reported in 167 of the 181 studies. One of the most common and informative metrics includes mean frame-wise displacement (FD), or the average displacement of the subject\u2019s head between two consecutive fMRI volumes in all six directions (3 translations and 3 rotations) (with higher values of FD indicating more substantial head motion). It is important to note that there is no strict threshold for what constitutes acceptable head motion and the threshold is often driven by the TR of the rsfMRI acquisition (see  ). However, most tools consider FD values below 0.5\u00a0mm as relatively low motion, while FD values greater than 3\u00a0mm are considered problematic. \n\nWhile Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is itself an analysis method for rsfMRI data, the assessment of the signal components obtained from ICA decomposition can be used as a quality metric at the level of the individual. The temporal characteristics of each independent component can be inspected for irregularity. Signal components usually have low frequency fluctuations (0.01 \u2013 0.1\u00a0Hz) and are fairly regular, while noisy components can be high in frequency with sudden spikes or differing patterns ( ). In studies with healthy subjects, the spatial maps of independent components can be examined to determine if well-defined functional networks (e.g., the default mode network, salience network, visual network, etc) are represented. If the data from the healthy subjects looks correct, the patient data may be examined for maps that are accurate or partially match the standard networks. \n\n\n### Employ consistent approaches for head motion correction procedures and nuisance signal regression \n  \nThe effects of head motion on data fidelity are now well recognized in rsfMRI data acquisitions ( ,  ,  ). Rigid-body spatial realignment of each acquired volume, spatial and temporal smoothing, and regression of motion parameters ( ;  ), are known to be insufficient to mitigate such effects. Since then, a growing literature has aimed at finding the best procedures for data pre-processing to effectively remove BOLD oscillations due to motion while preserving oscillations related to neural activity. This issue is all the more critical in the context of TBI, particularly in acute and moderate and severe cases in both pediatric and adult subjects, since they are well known to have increased incidence of in-scanner motion ( ;  ). \n\nIt is crucial for studies including TBI populations to use exacting procedures to reduce motion during acquisition and correct the effects of motion during pre-processing. For example, in a recent survey of 88 acute moderate-to-severe TBI patients, application of three different approaches to determine when to reject BOLD data due to excessive motion resulted in the loss of 9% to 32% of datasets ( ). When compared across a range of group-level data quality measures ( ), the approach resulting in the greatest data loss minimized the spurious effects of motion on brain correlations. Furthermore, under this most stringent data exclusion regime, group-level quality was uniformly high compared to the other approaches, across a range of pre-processing pipelines (cf.,  ,  ,  ). This is very important as it shows that appropriate rejection of datasets corrupted by excessive motion is a primary factor in determining quality of group-level data and allows researchers to then adopt the pre-processing strategy that best conforms to their research question.   \nAbility of different preprocessing pipelines (rows) to mitigate spurious head-motion related noise, under different participant exclusion regimens (i.e., censoring-based, lenient exclusion threshold, stringent exclusion threshold), as captured by two quality control metrics (top: the correlation between head motion parameters and functional connectivity, QC-FC; bottom: the degree to which the QC-FC correlation depends on how distant two ROIs are, QC-FC Distance dependence). As discussed in the text, stringent rejection of datasets (i.e., exclude if: <4 min of the data; mFD\u00a0>\u00a00.25\u00a0mm; FD\u00a0>\u00a00.2\u00a0mm in more than 20% of volumes; or any volume has FD\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0mm; cf.,  ) minimizes the spurious effects of motion and makes the choice of pipeline secondary, albeit at the cost of potentially large data loss. (Figure adapted from Weiler et al., 2023, OHBM). \n  \n\nBased on a recent comparison of different pre-processing strategies applied to moderate-to-severe TBI patients ( ), one of the most crucial aspects of denoising is the appropriate selection of which data to retain for analysis ( ,  ,  ). While costly in terms of degrees of freedom for inference, strict rejection of low-quality data (i.e., exclude if: < 4 min of data; mFD\u00a0>\u00a00.25\u00a0mm; FD\u00a0>\u00a00.2\u00a0mm in more than 20% of volumes; or any volume has FD\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0mm; cf.,  ) offers several advantages. First, and foremost, it has been shown to be the best strategy for minimizing spurious motion-related associations ( ,  ,  ). Second, when data are of high quality, selection of de-noising in the pipeline becomes secondary and can thus be guided by the nature of the datum (e.g., degree of pathology present) and the analytical approach that best matches the researcher\u2019s aims ( ). In the presence of extensive pathology, for example, methods that implement automated tissue segmentation (e.g., AROMA) might be less desirable than methods where segmentations can be performed with customized pipelines (e.g., aCompCor) or methods not requiring any segmentation (e.g., censoring). Similarly, choice of pre-processing strategy can constrain the analytical approaches that can then be applied. Techniques leveraging the frequency of BOLD fluctuations, for example, require the temporal structure of the data not to be altered by pre-processing; thus, pipelines that remove individual timepoints cannot be used (e.g., censoring). Retaining the freedom afforded by high-quality data to select the most appropriate pre-processing pipeline is thus an important aspect of being able to meet one\u2019s intended scientific goals. \n\n\n### Standardize procedures for dealing with lesions in moderate-to-severe TBI patients \n  \nThere are longstanding issues for handling MRI segmentation and normalization in the context of subcortical and cortical structural abnormalities, which are common in moderate to severe TBI. There have been no gold-standard solutions to date for handling brain lesions in the context of rsfMRI, often resulting in investigators removing any study participant with large identifiable changes due to neurotrauma, which is not ideal and fundamentally changes the scope of our work. There have been both manual (with some of the earliest over two decades ago, see  ), and automated attempts to handle TBI brain lesions (see  ,  ), including voxelwise examination of the constituents of the BOLD signal in   peri  -lesional space (e.g., oxygen extraction, cerebral blood flow) (see  ). In what follows, we provide simple guidelines and recommendations to alleviate the challenges of automated rsfMRI analysis for TBI patients. \n\nAn important difference in the rsfMRI signal between lesioned and non-lesioned tissue is edema and increased water resulting in a distinct signal detectable in T2* data acquisition ( ,  ). We recommend that researchers acquire a high-resolution T2*-weighted scan as part of their resting-state study. Doing so is useful to 1) localize edematous lesions and 2) to guide co-registration of T2* scans with T1 volumes. First, brain cells in regions affected by edema often exhibit more oxidative stress and higher rates of catabolic turnover and abnormal reactivity to physiological changes than cells affected by other lesion types, and these changes ordinarily affect the BOLD signal ( ). These processes typically affect T2* weighting more so than T1; the higher likelihood of BOLD signal hyperintensities due to these phenomena thus motivates the inclusion of T2* scans with rsfMRI protocols to render TBI-related fMRI signals less challenging to analyze. Second, to prevent co-registration failure in the presence of lesions, a first registration should be used to align rsfMRI scans to T2* weighted scans. In the second step, the T2* scans should be registered to T1 scans. Finally, the two registrations in steps 1 and 2 should be combined to generate a registration to align the fMRI scan to the T1 scan. \n\nImportantly, to identify the spatial profiles of regions with rsfMRI hyperintensities, it is helpful to investigate time-averaged rsfMRI maps. In the presence of posttraumatic edema, the sole inspection of single-time frame functional images may not be helpful because frame-to-frame oscillations in the fMRI signals of edematous areas are relatively less predictable, such that their visibility is poorer than on time-averaged fMRI maps. Such maps can be cross-referenced against fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) volumes, where edematous regions are more readily apparent in the presence of cerebrospinal fluid infiltration into the parenchyma ( ). In the absence of FLAIR scans, one can inspect T1-weighted scans for areas of low phospholipid density ( ). Such areas may appear hypointense if lipid density is sufficiently low relative to the healthy-appearing background; however, this is likelier for regions within gray matter rather than white matter. We recommend the inclusion of a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) scan as part of fMRI acquisition protocols, because T2*-weighted signal drop-out is produced by ferritin and\/or hemosiderin accumulation during acute hemorrhage and\/or chronic bleeds should be considered as additional factors that can alter the BOLD signal. Lesion boundaries can be difficult to delineate on typical T1- or T2*-weighted scans, but the synergy of SWI as part of a standard fMRI acquisition protocol for TBI patients with rsfMRI protocols can be helpful for lesion delineation ( ). Because the intensity profile of SWIs is very different from that of fMRI scans, these should not be coregistered directly. Rather, the SWI scan should first be registered to either the T1 or T2* scan, to which the fMRI was already registered as described above.   \nModels of edema (red), low-density tissue (yellow), and cerebral spinal fluid (blue) in a male subject with moderate-severe TBI (49\u00a0years old at time of scan, 15\u00a0years since injury). Lesion tracing indicates large areas of edema involving anterior and inferior frontal lobes, right lateral temporal and parietotemporal regions extending to the posterior frontal lobe. Low tissue density is observed in the anteromedial aspect of the right thalamus, and the anterior body and genu of the corpus callosum. MRI volumes (FLAIR,   T  -weighted, and averaged rsfMRIs) are provided below the model. Canonical volumetric views (axial, sagittal, and coronal) are displayed in radiological convention for all images. Five trained lesion raters traced edema on FLAIR volumes, and low-density tissue was traced on   T  -weighted MRI. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\n\n### Use standardized data processing workflows for pre-and post- processing analyses \n  \nAdoption of common data pre-processing and analysis procedures will maximize resources and opportunities for between-site data sharing and comparisons between studies. Of course, offering universal guidelines is challenging given the scientific demands of individual labs and investigators. To accommodate the tremendous diversity of pre- and post-processing analytical options ( ,  ,  ), there is a critical need for methodological universals that permit direct comparison to the literature. With respect to rsfMRI network analysis, there are (at least) two parts to this problem that require addressing. Both pertain to investigator degrees of freedom or \u201cforking paths\u201d ( ): the first path is related to data pre-processing and the second to the creation and analysis of functional neural networks. \n\nAdhering to established data processing workflows that are supported by empirical comparisons of pre-processing options is key to addressing issues pertaining to the first \u201cforking path\u201d. fMRIPrep ( ) is now a widely used software tool that performs a series of standard pre-processing steps (including data organization, anatomical data pre-processing, fMRI pre-processing, and several quality control metrics) to ensure the reliability of the rsfMRI data. More recently, the ENIGMA consortium has developed HALFpipe ( ), which is an open\u2010source tool that facilitates reproducible analysis of rsfMRI data through uniform application of pre-processing, quality assessment, single\u2010subject feature extraction, and group\u2010level statistics. This framework was developed specifically for neurological disorders with attention to the consequences of brain injury for structural and functional data ( ). \n\nIt is recognized that while we promote standardization in this critique, the goal is not to stifle creativity or scientific innovation. For investigators who cannot (for whatever reason) employ standard pipelines it is incumbent upon the scientific teams to demonstrate the reliability of the workflow including the effect of idiosyncratic deviations from the standard. This may include testing how each decision point influences data analysis and outcome \u2013 an approach now being formalized as multiverse analysis (see  ). Multiverse analysis provides the opportunity to directly examine the most consistent results across a range of data processing decisions. Such analyses have been applied to understand the effect of distinct covariates on analytical outcome (see  ) and may serve as a powerful tool to help in determining the consequences of investigator decisions on analytical outcomes and ensuring that the most robust findings emerge, independent of workflow decisions. These approaches may also aid in developing standards where the gold standard remains uncertain (e.g., some types of motion correction, segmentation with large brain lesions). \n\nRecent critiques have edged the clinical neurosciences toward standardization in network creation and analysis. This second \u201cforking path\u201d allows for fewer investigator decisions than those of pre-processing ( ,  ), that nonetheless are critical to data interpretation (see  ,  ). We summarized in   several key elements that all analyses should include to offer comparable network indices across papers.   \nSpecific considerations for functional connectomic studies in TBI (Table adapted from  ). \n  \n\n\n\n## Part 3: Future directions \n  \nThe goal of our seven recommendations for data acquisition, processing, and analysis of rsfMRI data in patients with TBI is to maximize study reliability and between-site comparability, pushing the field towards the future rsfMRI research in TBI patients. In the following section, we outline new directions for future rsfMRI studies, such as multimodal MRI studies for examining the relationships between structural connectivity and functional connectivity (SC-FC), lesion mapping strategies and single-subject profiling of functional connectivity for making inferences at the single subject level in patients with TBI. \n\n### Multimodal MRI studies \n  \nCombining complementary information from different imaging modalities may be more fruitful than reporting rsFC metrics in isolation (for a review, see  ;  ;  ). This is especially important for the study of brain-injured patients, as TBI has a cascade of complex effects on the brain that are better captured by multiple modalities. For example, T1-weighted imaging is necessary to ascertain direct and secondary tissue loss and atrophy ( ) and diffusion weighted imaging provides information about white matter (WM) damage (axonal loss and demyelination ( ,  )). A recent review has also identified multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers as one of the most promising areas of development, especially given the complexity of multiple secondary injury mechanisms in TBI, stating it may be \u201chelpful to test multiple sources to identify a specific injury profile and tailor treatment more effectively\u201d ( ). \n\nAs can be seen in the Supplementary Table (indicated by \u25ca), 53 studies analyzed other modalities in addition to rsfMRI. For example,   examined TBI-induced alterations in both functional and structural networks, which showed overlapping results. Specifically, TBI patients demonstrated increased prefrontal connectivity in SC-FC networks, relative to controls. In a study by  , the discriminatory power of their logistic regression models yielded higher accuracy if FA (fractional anisotropy) of the corpus callosum was modeled alongside functional connectivity values. Despite these promising multimodal findings, these studies often derived the structural connectivity measures in the form of a single score (e.g., FA value of a white matter tract). However, it is important and informative to reconstruct equidimensional SC-FC indices with respect to the same set of atlas templates ( ). Recent toolboxes, such as Micapipe ( ) and Connectivity Analysis Toolbox (CAT) ( ) allow researchers to reconstruct SC-FC for the same pair of regions of interest based on (sub)cortical atlases providing aligned connectivity matrices for integrative multimodal MRI analyses. Moreover, in order to extract relevant information from the brain\u2019s structural\u2013functional relationship, it is necessary to validate them against different parameters of another framework, such as graph theory. \n\nRecent developments in network neuroscience facilitate investigating direct structure\u2013function relationships.   published one of the first studies using an advanced integrative network analysis to facilitate the integration of multiple sources of information. Specifically, they used a network diffusion model, which relates an individual's structural and functional connectomes by assuming that functional activation diffuses along structural pathways, to capture functional rerouting. Their findings revealed strong significant correlations between level of consciousness and network diffusion model propagation time (i.e., the time functional activation spends traversing the structural network) in severe TBI patients. In a recent study by  , the authors applied another novel mathematical framework, known as a multiplex network analysis ( ), to quantify the proportion of direct and indirect SC-FC connections across the brain. They extracted the degree of structural connectivity between the functional synchronous nodes across the brain network, i.e., SC-FC Multiplex Bandwidth. Their multiplex analyses revealed that direct and indirect SC-FC Bandwidth predicted processing speed in mild TBI patients. Moreover, a subnetwork of interhemispheric edges with increased SC-FC Bandwidth was identified at the chronic, relative to the acute mild TBI post-injury interval. The increased interhemispheric SC-FC Bandwidth of this network corresponded with improved processing speed at the chronic post-injury interval. These integrative network analyses are novel and make a nice contribution to the rsfMRI literature in TBI patients, as they shed light on the relationship between connectomics and impairment\/recovery after TBI. Future work should use more advanced models (including multilayer network analysis, neural mass models, etc) to study relationships between relevant variables across several brain metrics that may underpin behavioral outcomes in TBI patients. \n\n\n### Lesion mapping strategies \n  \nAs raised in recommendation 3.6, there are no gold-standard solutions to date for handling brain lesions in the context of rsfMRI analyses. However, it is common practice in the TBI literature to compare whole-brain FC maps between groups without masking out lesioned areas (see Supplementary Table). The lesion masks can be generated using (semi) automated lesion identification tools ( ,  ), in conjunction with expertise from neurologists and neuroradiologists to enhance the accuracy of the lesion maps and clinical relevance of the rs-fMRI findings. For example, in   T1-weighted images were inspected for focal lesions and manually traced using FSLVIEW and these resulting lesion masks were used during special normalization with FNIRT to increase the accuracy of the alignment to MNI space. \n\nAnother potential strategy is to verify whether FC differences between TBI patients and controls are due to the presence of focal lesions in the TBI sample. For example,   conducted a separate analysis confirming that differences in interhemispheric FC remained evident even when patients with focal lesions were excluded. Similarly, in work by  , their subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of CT-lesions by comparing network measures between patients with (14 patients) and without lesions (54 patients) on CT scans. \n\nResearchers can also consider adjusting for lesion characteristics (such as number of lesions, lesion volume) in the statistical analyses. This was done in a functional connectome study by  , whereby total lesion volume (calculated a percentage of lesion volume to total gray matter volume) was used as a predictor of total network strength at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months following moderate and severe TBI. The results demonstrated a near-zero relationship between lesion volume and global network strength. Although white matter volume could also be important to take into account, and the method of lesion segmentation could affect accuracy of volume measures ( ). Yet, another strategy is to implement ROI analyses focusing on specific brain regions affected by lesions to gain insights into localised effects. It should be emphasized, however, that unlike brain tumor or stroke, the pathophysiology of TBI is not easily isolated to a single location ( ). Therefore, convergent findings are often indicators of brain response to insult more generally as opposed to ROI-based injury-brain-behavior response. Thus, there is currently no agreed upon approach for handling conspicuous brain pathology after TBI in FC analyses. While this paper is focused on TBI, future work may be informed by lesion measurement and correction in white matter diseases ( ). Other recent developments include lesion identification and in-painting of brain lesions, via virtual brain grafting or deep learning approaches ( ,  ,  ) that may substantially improve brain parcellation thus reducing the extent to which individual regions or whole TBI patients need to be excluded from analysis due to failure. \n\n\n### Single-subject analyses \n  \nThe majority of the rsfMRI studies (see Supplementary Table) have focused on   group-wise   comparisons in functional connectivity metrics (i.e., N patients vs M controls). These traditional group analyses cannot adequately reflect what happens in individual TBI patients or handle between-patient heterogeneity ( ). Moreover, clinicians need to perform diagnostic and prognostic inferences at the level of   individual   TBI patients. There are several recent rsfMRI studies that exploit TBI heterogeneity with the aim of individualizing approaches to treatment. \n\nIn recent years, rsfMRI has been integrated in the clinical practice, where it is utilized to obtain personalized brain stimulation targets and to understand each patient\u2019s brain-based changes in said targeted networks. For example, a proof-of-concept study combining data from five studies demonstrated that using multimodal neuroimaging (including rsfMRI) helps to customize Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment, by targeting specific brain areas and networks in mild and severe TBI patients with co-occurring depression, alcohol use disorder, and cognitive dysfunction ( ). Relatedly, analysis of rsFC at the network level has been suggested to be more important in TBI patients where injury may have further increased the inter-individual variability already observed across healthy brains ( ). Several studies have shown that focusing on rsfMRI subnetworks associated with complex symptoms reported across TBI patients may be the best way to tackle the challenge of interindividual variability ( ,  ,  ,  ). For example, the cingulo-opercular network and the dorsal attention network can be differentially targeted within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to address distinct clusters of cognitive deficits or mood problems. These two networks could be differentiated and identified in a patient with severe TBI and a comorbid disorder of consciousness ( ). Resting-state fMRI is being increasingly adopted to aid with both diagnosis and prognosis across several neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Similarly, in the context of severe brain injury, recent translational guidelines recommend including rsfMRI in the diagnostic and prognostic process for patients with disorders of consciousness ( ). \n\nDespite this emerging base of empirical work over recent years, there are only a few available neuroimaging-based clinical tools ( ) that allow single-subject level inferences to be made. Specifically, there is a need to develop patient-tailored frameworks that produce detailed subject-specific characterization of rsFC, including regional alterations, and changes in subnetworks, and network metrics of entire functional connectomes. The resulting individual profiles can then be evaluated against reference populations, such as a group of orthopedic or healthy controls. This contextual information can enable us to meaningfully, qualitatively, and quantitatively, assess rsFC alterations in single individuals. These individual brain measures can be used by clinicians for integrative neuroscience-guided rehabilitation ( ,  ,  ), assisting them in designing personalized rehabilitation programs (based on the unique profile of each patient), track their progress and adjust care as necessary. Recent studies already successfully employed this novel single-subject brain profiling in TBI patients, albeit in small TBI samples using   structural   MRI metrics ( ,  ,  ,  ). These single-subject analyses will require the development of large reference cohorts of healthy controls (N\u00a0>\u00a0100) ( ) that are stratified by age group, gender, and other important demographic variables (such as level of education, see  ) to detect FC abnormalities at the level of the individual patient as statistical deviation from the reference group, as done in the ENIGMA Lifespan Working group using morphological brain metrics (CentileBrain,  ). Such profiling will enable clinicians to progress from the traditional paradigm of group-based comparisons of TBI patients against controls, to a personalized medicine approach, taking us a step closer to translational integrative research that informs clinical practice. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThere remains tremendous promise in the application of rsfMRI in the study of neurological disorders, and in particular TBI. To date, however, this potential has yet to be realized, slowed by limited sample sizes that fail to address clinical and demographic heterogeneity and the sheer volume of analytical approaches, rendering most findings as isolated observations that are irreproducible. In response to these widely recognized concerns in the fMRI literature, the goal of this position paper was to summarize the current literature and then offer directions for a path forward applying rsfMRI to the study of TBI. First, there is a need for data sharing and larger samples. Second, there is a need for greater consistency of methods and analyses to facilitate contributions to the literature that permit synthesis and more direct interpretation. There is also a need for more transparency with respect to analytical pipelines and making data and code available for confirmation of findings within the broader TBI community. While not all recommendations offered here will be agreed upon by the community, if this paper elicits conversations that achieve consensus on methods and procedures, then the field will benefit greatly. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Karen Caeyenberghs:   Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision.

The scope of the present activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was to quantitatively analyze neuroimaging studies of happy AMs conducted with autobiographical recall paradigms. A total of 17 studies (12 fMRI; 5 PET) on healthy individuals were included in this meta-analysis. During recall of happy life events, consistent activation foci were found in the frontal gyrus, the cingulate cortex, the basal ganglia, the parahippocampus\/hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus. The result of this quantitative coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis provides an objective view of brain responses associated with AM recollection of happy events, thus identifying brain areas consistently activated across studies. This extended brain network included frontal and limbic regions involved in remembering emotionally relevant positive events. The frontal gyrus and the cingulate cortex may be responsible for cognitive appraisal processes during recollection of happy AMs, while the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus may be involved in pleasure reactions associated with recollection of happy life events. These findings shed light on the neural network involved in recalling positive AMs in healthy individuals, opening further avenues for future research in clinical populations with mood disorders. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAutobiographical memory (AM) refers to the ability to remember events and lifetime periods from one\u2019s past, which is crucial for a sense of identity, self-continuity, and mental time traveling [ , , , ]. AM is considered a subsystem of episodic memory, more generally defined as the conscious recollection of experienced events and meaningful reconstruction of one\u2019s own past [ ]. According to Rubin [ , , ], retrieval of AMs results from the interaction between multiple neural and cognitive systems; specifically, this process includes the recollection of personal life events (i.e., the ability to retrieve, re-experience, and relive a past event), self-referential processing, mental imagery, narrative reasoning, language, and emotion.  \n\nAMs are generally characterized by emotional content compared to other types of episodic or semantic memories [ , , ]. AMs with positive emotional valence are generally marked under the broad category of positive AMs. However, the expressions positive AMs and happy AMs are often used interchangeably in the literature. In the following, we will refer to the concept of happy AMs. Indeed, the majority of the studies included in the current meta-analysis instructed participants to recall happy AMs instead of positive AMs. Noteworthy, happy life events do not constitute a homogenous category: for example, a distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic happy events (hedonic events include life occurrences in which people pursue extrinsically motivated activities to experience enjoyment and pleasure, either sensory or psychological, whereas eudaimonic happy events are life occurrences in which people engage in intrinsically meaningful activities that enable the person to cultivate his or her skills and to develop his or her best potentials [ , ]) has been proposed in recent years by Positive Psychology [ , , ]. Happy personal events occur frequently and occupy a central position in the life stories of individuals [ , , , ]. Empirical research on happy AMs may be particularly relevant since remembering these types of events may induce the re-experience of positive emotions, potentially contributing to psychological well-being and quality of life.  \n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies of AM increased over the last decade, allowing an enlarged understanding of brain processes and neural underpinning of memory for personal experiences. A distributed network encompassing different subsystems of AMs (e.g., recollection, self-referential processing, emotional component) has been identified. This network operates thanks to the contribution of the following neural areas: the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus for AMs retrieval [ ]; the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) for memory search and controlled processes [ , ]; the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for self-referential processes [ , , ]; the lateral and medial parietal cortex for orienting attentional resources to internal representations, contributing to the re-experience of AMs [ , ], and visual-processing areas including the occipital cortex, cuneus, and precuneus to evoke vivid sensory details and mental imagery [ , ].  \n\nAs regards the emotional component of AMs, recollection of emotionally relevant personal events involves frontotemporal regions and limbic areas such as the amygdala [ , , ], the hippocampus [ ], and the inferior frontal gyrus [ ]. Concerning the emotional dimensions of AMs, the intensity of the emotion (arousal) affects the degree to which a personal life event is relived during retrieval and memory vividness [ ]. In addition to arousal, the valence of an emotional event can influence how likely and how accurately AMs are remembered [ , ]. Accordingly, neuroimaging showed that brain activity during recall of AMs is modulated not only by arousal but also by the valence of emotion [ , ].  \n\nNeuroscientific research on AMs with emotional content has developed various methods of mood induction, with autobiographical recall being the most effective compared to other approaches [ ]. In autobiographical recall tasks, participants are usually submitted to a pre-scan interview in which they have to select and write down personal events of their lives. Afterward, interviews are reviewed by the experimenter and then presented during the scan session using generic or specific cues to elicit the retrieval (i.e., written instruction, emotionally related words or images, human faces expressing emotions) [ ]. Then, participants are guided by the cues to relieve and re-experience their emotional events as vividly and intensively as possible [ ]. \n\nIn 2002, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies investigating emotions was conducted [ ] including 16 (out of 55) studies using autobiographical recall methods to induce retrieval of personal emotional events (e.g., fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust). Results showed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula are the brain regions most frequently activated during the recall of AMs, regardless of their valence. Of note, some of these studies highlighted differential brain activations during the recall of AMs corresponding to positive valence. For example, Lane and colleagues [ ] showed greater activation of the ventromedial PFC while recalling AMs for happy events compared to AMs for sad events. Accordingly, subsequent studies showed that frontal brain regions (e.g., medial PFC) were more active during retrieval of positive AMs, whereas posterior regions (e.g., right temporal lobe) were more active during retrieval of negative events [ , ].  \n\nThe interest in understanding the processing of positive emotions such as happiness and joy and their neural correlates has increased [ , , , , , ]. A meta-analysis of imaging studies on happiness was conducted to identify the neural correlates of three happiness domains: pleasure, engagement, and meaning [ ]. A wide range of tasks was used to examine these three domains of happiness across the 64 studies included in the meta-analysis identifying 33 brain regions [ ]. A further step would be the identification of the brain areas that are specifically involved in the reliving of positive AMs in healthy individuals. This is crucial for understanding their possible alterations in mood disorders: for example, depressed individuals exhibit impaired memory for positive material [ ] and recall less vividly positive AMs [ ]. In this direction, a work by Suardi and colleagues [ ] reviewed 15 neuroimaging studies (7 fMRI, 8 PET) investigating AMs of happy events in healthy individuals, all of them employing autobiographical recall methods. The PFC, ACC, and insula were the most frequently reported areas associated with remembering happy AMs, suggesting that these may be crucial areas implicated in the recall of positive AMs. However, due to the descriptive nature of the review, it was not possible to quantitatively define consistent and significant activation patterns across studies.  \n\nOf note, individual imaging studies, if examined separately, have small sample sizes, thus leading to low statistical power and low reliability [ ]. Furthermore, evaluating consistency is important to avoid false-positive rates in the activation locations reported by single studies, which in neuroimaging is relatively high compared to other fields [ ]. To overcome these limitations, meta-analysis is a valuable tool for summarizing results and identifying consistently activated brain regions across a set of studies [ ]. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify consistent activations across neuroimaging studies of AM for happy life events using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ , ], which is one of the most common algorithms used for coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. To elucidate the neural underpinning of happy AMs, all the included studies were conducted in healthy samples.  \n\nThe present meta-analysis differs from those previously described [ , ]. First, we investigated the neural correlates of positive AMs rather than happiness as a broader emotion [ ]. Second, the present work includes a significantly larger number of studies on happy AMs than the previous meta-analysis conducted by Phan and colleagues in 2002 [ ]. Finally, this is the first meta-analysis to focus on autobiographical recall as a specific type of mood induction procedure, which would help to reduce the differences in brain activation related to the experimental paradigm.  \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Information Sources and Search Strategy \n  \nThis meta-analysis was conducted according to the international guidelines embraced by the Cochrane Collaboration and the \u201cPRISMA\u201d statement to ensure transparent and complete reporting of data selection [ ]. A systematic literature search strategy was conducted using the two electronic databases (Web of Science and PubMed\/Medline). The search included articles published up to 22 January 2023. Different sets of query terms were adopted:    \n\u201cautobiographical memory\u201d OR \u201cautobiographical recall\u201d, AND \u201cpositive events\u201d, OR \u201chappy events\u201d, AND \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d. \n  \n\u201cautobiographical memory\u201d OR \u201cautobiographical recall\u201d, AND \u201cpositive events\u201d OR \u201chappy events\u201d, AND \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. \n  \n\nAdditional sources included published reviews and meta-analyses on neural correlates of emotions and specifically on autobiographical memory for emotional events (e.g., [ , , , ]). Most of the studies were selected from a previous review paper on the neural correlates of happiness [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.2. Eligibility Criteria \n  \nThe retrieved papers were analyzed to ascertain that they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) population of healthy adults (2) using autobiographical recall to asses AMs referred to specific events (i.e., episodes lasting between some minutes and one day); (3) including happy AMs and a control condition, such as AM of neutral events or events eliciting emotions with a negative valence (e.g., fear, disgust, sadness); (4) presenting specified neuroimaging acquisition parameters: (a) using whole-brain analysis; (b) reporting the results in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates; (5) reporting cerebral activation changes, as assessed by blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) -fMRI or PET.  \n\nWe excluded studies that employed non-human participants, clinical populations, as well as those not assessing AM using autobiographical recall techniques or not respecting the neuroimaging parameters. The following publication types were excluded: meta-analysis, systematic reviews, case reports or series, and grey literature. Moreover, articles not written in English were excluded. The authors double-checked the fulfillment of the eligibility criteria.  \n\n\n### 2.3. Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis  \n  \nALE was performed using the random effects algorithm of GingerAle (v.3.0.2,  , accessed date: 22 January 2023) [ , , ]. Each focus of every experiment is modeled by the ALE as a Gaussian probability distribution: \nwhere d indicates the Euclidean distance between the voxels and the considered focus, and   indicates the spatial uncertainty. The standard deviation is easily obtained through the Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) as follows: \n\nSubsequently, we determined for every experiment a modeled alteration (MA) map as the union of the Gaussian probability distribution of each focus of the experiment. The union of these MA maps provided the final ALE map. The statistical significance of the activation within the ALE map was calculated by cluster-level inference, as suggested by Eickhoff et al. [ , , ]. Given a particular cluster forming threshold, a null distribution of cluster sizes was obtained by simulating a long series of experiments using the same characteristic of the real data and then by calculating an ALE map. The obtained score histogram was used to assign threshold p values. \n\n\n### 2.4. Automated Regional Behavioral Analysis \n  \nThe cluster obtained from the previous ALE meta-analysis was submitted to an automated regional behavioral analysis [ ]. Behavioral analysis software was developed and tested as a plug-in application for the Multi-image Analysis GUI (Mango, v. 4.1) image processing system (Lancaster, Martinez;  , accessed date: 22 January 2023). A primary goal of the behavioral analysis is to determine specific behaviors for each region under investigation. The analysis is performed in several steps. For each location in the cluster image obtained from the ALE analysis, a table of behavior domains and sub-domains within each row of the list of coordinates is created. Then, for each location in a behavior coordinate list, a \u201cone\u201d is added and then an image of activation foci by location is created.  \n\nTo test for the significance of behaviors, we used the null hypothesis that the observed probability of activation foci was not different from expected, i.e., that po = pe. To determine variance for effect size, we modeled the two possible outcomes of activations (inside or outside of the ROI) using the binomial distribution. In this study, po and pe served as binomial \u201csuccess\u201d probabilities (probability of activations falling within the ROI) and the number of trials was the whole-brain activation tally (Nb) for a sub-domain. For the binomial distribution, the variance of \u201cp\u201d is calculated as p(1 \u2212 p)\/N. An effect-size z-score for each behavioral sub-domain was calculated.  \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nA total of 365 articles were retrieved from the literature search and other sources. After removing duplicates (n = 100), we conducted title and abstract screening for the remaining 287 studies. This resulted in the exclusion of 243 studies because they were not related to emotional AMs or because they did not use neuroimaging (i.e., fMRI or PET). The remaining 44 studies were screened at a full-text level. Of these studies, 27 were excluded for reasons including (1) no contrasts for happy AM; (2) no coordinates; (3) region of interest (ROI) analysis; (4) only deactivation foci for happy AM; (5) no healthy control sample; (6) review\/meta-analysis. A total of 17 studies (12 fMRI, 5 PET) were finally included in the meta-analysis (see  ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Characteristics of the Studies  \n  \nThe 17 studies included were published between 1995 and 2019. For each study, the following characteristics are specified in  : the sample size; the neuroimaging technique; the recall induction technique adopted to elicit AMs; the remoteness of the events to remember; which experimental conditions are contrasted to measure brain activation (e.g., happiness vs. neutral); and the number of activation foci (See  ).  \n\nThe total sample comprised 340 healthy participants ranging in age from 18 to 74 years. Although the majority of studies recruited participants of both genders, six studies included only female participants [ , , , , , , ] and one study included only male participants [ ], resulting in an overall higher number of females (n = 241) than males (n = 99) in the final sample. \n\nIn all the studies, participants were required to re-imagine or mentally recall AMs during the MRI scan. The technique adopted to elicit autobiographical recall differed across studies. In most of the studies, participants are required to recall and relive personally experienced emotional events selected prior to the experimental session. The autobiographical events were cued by written keywords or short sentences in nine studies (see  ). In four studies [ , , , ], events to be recalled were elicited by listening to pre-recorded audio scripts of autobiographical events. In two studies, the events were cued by pictures depicting emotional facial expressions [ , ], whereas in one study [ ], emotional pictures from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS [ ]) served as cues. All the studies adopted a measure to assess the effectiveness of the recall procedure by asking participants to evaluate phenomenological features of AMs (e.g., vividness, intensity, sensory details), although these measures varied across studies. Although neural differences have been suggested during the search and the elaboration phases of the memory process [ ], none of the studies included a distinction between these two stages of AM retrieval.  \n\nEight out of seventeen studies [ , , , , , , , ] considered the remoteness of the event to recall, by asking the participants to evoke events within defined time periods (e.g., the last 5 years). By contrast, in the rest of the studies, participants were free to evoke AMs, without any temporal delimitation. \n\nIn eight studies, cerebral activations referred to the contrast between a happiness condition and a neutral condition consisting of recalling autobiographical events without emotional content [ , , , , , , , ], with two studies additionally including the contrast between happiness and irritability [ , ]. In four studies, the control conditions were AMs with negative valence [ , , , ]; in one study, AMs related to sadness [ ]; and in two studies, AMs related to disgust [ ]. Of note, two studies [ , ] reported activations for a happiness condition contrasted with a resting condition, and one study [ ] contrasted a happiness condition with a control task (count backward from 100 by subtracting 4). A total of 282 activation foci were reported for all the studies.  \n  \nCharacteristics of the studies and number of activation foci. \n    \n\n### 3.3.

ALE maps were computed using GingerALE 3.0.2, at an FWE-corrected threshold of   p   < 0.05, with a minimum cluster size of K >150 mm , and visualized using Mango ( ). Eight activation clusters were found. One cluster included the left medial frontal gyrus and the left anterior cingulate (BA 10, 32). Other clusters were identified, including the left posterior cingulate (BA 23, 31), the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 9), and the anterior cingulate (BA 32). Another cluster was found in the left hypothalamus and the left medial globus pallidus. One cluster included the left parahippocampus (BA 35, 36) and parahippocampal structures, and another cluster was found in the left hippocampus and the lateral globus pallidus. Finally, the right thalamus, including the subthalamic nucleus, constituted another cluster of activation.  \n\n\n### 3.4. Characterization of the Clusters \n  \nTo characterize in terms of behavior of the various clusters found with the ALE methods, we used a plug-in of the Mango software (v.4.1) [ ] that automatically associates the different clusters with the different behavioral domains using the BrainMap database. BrainMap categorizes functional imaging experiments using five major behavioral domains (action, cognition, emotion, interoception, and perception) with 51 sub-domains. Each experiment in BrainMap is assigned one or more behavioral classifications along with the set of coordinates for reported activations, and these data provide the basic structure for forming behavioral probability distributions as 3D images. Region of interest (ROI) analysis is applied to these spatial probability images to assess behaviors.  \n\nThe behavioral analysis (BD) was performed with a minimum threshold of activation of 38 foci (labeled as \u201crow counts\u201d in the output of the behavioral analysis plug-in in the Multi-image Analysis GUI). Several BD were identified within the domains of cognition (explicit memory, semantic language, social cognition) and emotion (happiness, fear) (See  ).  \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe novel aim of this coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis was to quantitatively analyze the results of neuroimaging studies investigating cerebral activation changes during autobiographical recall of happy life events. This is the first attempt to consider autobiographical recall paradigms assessing happy AMs in a single analysis, to give a more objective perspective of the cerebral network involved when recalling AMs for happy events. \n\nThis review included 17 studies (12 fMRI, 5 PET), with an overall number of subjects of 340 for a total of 282 activation foci identified, which is considered a sufficient number to proceed with ALE analysis (as previously stated by Laird in her \u201cUsers\u2019 Manual for BrainMap GingerALE 2.0\u201d).  \n\nThe outcome of the ALE was characterized by brain regions consistently activated when recalling AMs for happy events. The activation clusters encompassed the frontal gyrus and the cingulate cortex, the basal ganglia, the parahippocampal structures, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus.  \n\nConcerning frontal regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be part of the brain network involved in autobiographical recall processes [ ]. Specifically, the medial PFC network, including the anterior and posterior midline regions, has been linked to self-referential processes implicated when recalling personal life events [ , , ]. Here, we found a consistent activation of the superior and medial frontal gyrus during recall of happy AMs. Previous studies showed that the activation of brain areas within the medial PFC is more frequently associated with happy AMs, whereas activation of the lateral PFC is more frequently associated with sad AMs [ , , , ]. In the present meta-analysis, consistent activation of the medial (but not the lateral PFC) seems to support this lateral\/medial differentiation in the processing of sad\/happy AMs.  \n\nAdditional frontal areas were represented by activation in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the poster cingulate cortex (PCC). The cingulate cortex activity has been associated with happiness [ , ], although it seems likely that the cingulate cortex plays a key role in both positive and negative emotions [ ]. In addition, the cingulate cortex is known to be involved in AMs [ , , ] and the PCC has particularly strong reciprocal connections with medial temporal lobe memory structures such as the entorhinal and the parahippocampal cortices [ ]. Furthermore, the PCC and the medial PFC together with other memory-related areas are part of the \u201cbrain default network\u201d [ , ] which is crucial for self-representation and self-consciousness implicated in the recall of AMs. The ACC, closely interconnected to the medial PFC, is known to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing [ , , ], and consistent activation of the ACC has been found during recall of emotional AMs [ ].  \n\nConcerning the basal ganglia, activation foci were found in the lateral and medial globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus. The role of these structures in the reward circuit has been recognized in non-human primates [ , , ] and more recently in humans [ ]. Therefore, the activation of these reward-related areas could be explained by the hedonic features of happy AMs, reflecting hedonic happiness [ , , ].  \n\nFinally, the activation found in the parahippocampal regions is consistent with the role of the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus in AMs retrieval [ ], whereas the activation of the hypothalamus and the thalamus may be related to the recall and reliving of sensory and bodily signals associated with happy personal memories [ , ].  \n\nThe majority of clusters were identified in the left hemisphere, aligning with the consistent left-lateralized activation tendency reported in previous neuroimaging literature on autobiographical memory [ , , ]. This inclination is likely attributed to the verbal modality of autobiographical recall tasks, often involving written keywords or short sentences, thereby implicating the left hemisphere. \n\nFunctional characterization of these activations was given by the automated regional behavioral analysis (BD) [ ], suggesting that a high portion of the activation foci (n = 157) corresponds to the behavioral domain of emotion, with happiness being the most representative one. Other BD included cognitive domains, mainly represented by episodic memory as expected. A second cognitive domain shown is semantic language, possibly indicating an increase in semantic processing during recall of happy AMs. This may reflect the activation of the PFC and its role in the processing of semantic and conceptual information [ , , ]. \n\nTaken together, the results of the present meta-analysis enable the identification of brain areas consistently activated during the recall of happy AMs. Frontal regions, such as the frontal gyrus and the cingulate cortex, might account for the cognitive processes involved in the subjective appraisal of recalled happy AMs, whereas the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus may be responsible for the pleasure reactions associated with recalling happy AMs. Some of these areas, such as the basal ganglia, the PFC, and the cingulate cortex, align with those previously identified for happiness as a broad emotion [ ]. In contrast, other areas, like the amygdala and the insula, did not consistently activate during the recall of happy AMs. This is in line with evidence indicating that the amygdala and the insula are more likely to exhibit increased activation during negative affect than positive affect, despite their responsiveness to both positive and negative affect more than neutral affect [ ]. Additionally, early findings from a meta-analysis indicate consistent activation of the amygdala for AMs of fear and the insula for AMs of disgust [ ].  \n\nThe present work should be interpreted in light of some limitations. Firstly, only a small number of studies (9 out of 17) included the contrast between positive and negative events, and some studies focused on different types of negative emotional AM (e.g., sadness, irritability). Hence, it was not possible to run a separate analysis for the contrast of positive vs. negative AMs, because the results could be strongly driven by only a few experiments [ , ]. However, a direct comparison between negative and positive AMs would help to investigate and discuss possible overlap and discrepancies in brain activity during the recall of positive vs. negative AMs. Thus, this should be considered as an important limitation and results should be interpreted with caution.  \n\nSecondly, a factor potentially contributing to differential brain activations is related to the remoteness of the evoked AM. So far, some studies have shown greater activation of the medial temporal lobe during retrieval of recent compared to remote episodic memories [ , , ], although other studies did not confirm this differential activation associated with remoteness [ , , , , , , ]. In the current meta-analysis, remoteness was not included as a parameter, given that only eight studies adopted specific temporal information of the AMs (see  ), also showing discrepancies in the remoteness of the evoked AMs (e.g., recent vs. remote). Specifically, some studies focused on recent memories from 6\u201312 months to 5 years, whereas others included remote AMs from adulthood (e.g., from 18 years) or adolescence\/childhood (e.g., before 12 years).  \n\nAnother limitation is that only activation foci of happy AMs were analyzed, while deactivations were not considered in this study. The decision to exclude deactivations was influenced by the prevalence of articles primarily featuring activations, leaving an inadequate number of articles for a comprehensive meta-analysis of deactivations. \n\nFinally, the demographic variables of the current sample such as the higher proportion of females should be considered when interpreting the results. Previous studies have demonstrated gender differences in AM, which are also reflected in different neural activations during AM recall [ , , ]. Age is another crucial variable in the context of AM, as healthy aging tends to reduce the episodic richness of AM retrieval [ ]. Thus, the wide age range (from 18 to 75) across studies in the meta-analysis may potentially mask age-related differences in the neural correlates of happy AMs that are worth investigating in specific age groups (for example, younger and older people). \n\nDespite these limitations, the results obtained offer new insights into the neural correlates of positive AMs, identifying for the first time consistent brain activations across the existing studies using autobiographical recall methods with happy life events. Identifying the neural correlates of positive AMs in healthy individuals is the first step to extending the basic understanding of dysfunctional processes in affective disorders [ , ]. Individuals with depression have shown impairment in autobiographical memory retrieval, particularly in relation to positive material [ , , ]. Future studies could investigate functional alterations during recall of positive AMs as possible biomarkers of individuals at risk of developing mood disorders. Furthermore, changes induced by pharmacological or psychological treatments have been described in depression [ ]. Similarly, changes in the processing of positive AMs following pharmacological or psychological therapies for depression could be investigated to identify biomarkers of clinical response to treatment.  \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThe present coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis identified a set of brain regions that are consistently activated during the recall of happy AMs. This included frontal regions (i.e., prefrontal gyrus and cingulate cortex) exerting cognitive control, basal ganglia structures (i.e., globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus) related to reward, as well as the memory-related hippocampus and thalamic structures for sensory integration during the recall of AMs. Such a highly distributed brain network encompasses areas that mainly involve the emotion domain and cognitive domains of memory and semantic processing.  \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":11011908,"text_md5":"2c2d1ef975b733a7f1c2a84189a63320","field_positions":{"authors":[0,92],"journal":[93,111],"publication_year":[113,117],"title":[128,233],"keywords":[247,398],"abstract":[411,1869],"body":[1878,31781]},"batch":1,"pmid":38610134,"doi":"10.3390\/healthcare12070711","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11011908","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=11011908"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC11011908\">11011908<\/a>","list_title":"PMC11011908  The Functional Neuroimaging of Autobiographical Memory for Happy Events: A Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis"}

While previous work has independently probed when or where this memorability effect may occur in the human brain, a description of its spatiotemporal dynamics is missing. Here, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with source-estimated magnetoencephalography (MEG) to simultaneously measure when and where the human cortex is sensitive to differences in image memorability. Results reveal that visual perception of High Memorable images, compared to Low Memorable images, recruits a set of regions of interest (ROIs) distributed throughout the ventral visual cortex: a late memorability response (from around 300 ms) in early visual cortex (EVC), inferior temporal cortex, lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, and banks of the superior temporal sulcus. Image memorability magnitude results are represented after high-level feature processing in visual regions and reflected in classical memory regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Our results present, to our knowledge, the first unified spatiotemporal account of visual memorability effect across the human cortex, further supporting the levels-of-processing theory of perception and memory. \n  \nHow does the processing of images with high and low memorability differ in the brain? This study combines functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography to show that only images with high memorability scores undergo extended processing late in time throughout the ventral visual stream, including early visual cortex. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAlthough visual memorability feels at first a subjective and hard to quantify property of an image, many behavioral, neuroscience, and computational works have shown that it is not an inexplicable phenomenon\u2014we can calculate an image\u2019s memorability score as its probability of being correctly remembered at a later viewing. Visual memorability has been shown to be intrinsic to the stimulus and reproducible across individuals. This means that despite varied experiences, individuals tend to remember and forget the same images [ \u2013 ]. This suggests images with a high memorability score are better encoded into and retrieved from memory not due to individual preferences, but due to perceptual properties of the stimuli [ , \u2013 ]. \n\nMeasuring these perceptual differences between images with high and low memorability scores can support or discourage theories relating perception and memory processes. Differences arising in the first few hundred milliseconds of perception within perceptual regions may better align with the levels-of-processing theory of memory, which posits that memory of a stimulus is a result of deeply processing the stimulus during perception [ , ]. Differences arising in non-perceptual regions temporally distinct from perception may better align with the multi-store models of memory, which states that stimulus processing and memory storage are separate [ ]. A spatiotemporal account of the memorability effect would allow for controlled examination of this crucial link between perception and memory. \n\nThe current spatiotemporal account of memorability sensitivity is coarse and may be incomplete, relying on results pieced together from independent unimodal experiments with different subjects, stimulus sets, and tasks. Previous work spatially localizes memorability sensitivity to ventral and medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions [ \u2013 ] and temporally localizes it to a middle stage of visual perception, at around 150 ms poststimulus onset [ ]. When specific regions of interest (ROIs) become sensitive to memorability relative to both stimulus onset and other perceptual processes remains unknown. \n\nHere, we describe the dynamics of image memorability in humans in high spatiotemporal resolution by combining 2 neuroimaging techniques, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method is known as MEG-fMRI fusion [ \u2013 ]. We isolate the effect of image memorability using semantically matched High Memorable and Low Memorable stimulus sets controlled for low-level features (see  ). In doing so, we provide a unified account of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the memorability effect throughout the whole brain and identify which brain regions are sensitive to memorability and when. \n\nTo anticipate our results, we find that images with high memorability scores recruit a distributed network of ventral visual regions for temporally extended processing late in time, beginning at approximately 250 ms poststimulus onset. We identify 5 ROIs, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, banks superior temporal sulcus (banks of the STS), and, notably, early visual cortex (EVC), as showing significant sensitivity to image memorability. We provide evidence that image memorability overlaps with both visual perceptual and memory regions by measuring how well a representation derived from human-based memorability score magnitudes matches neural representations in classical visual and memory regions. We find the memorability magnitude representation arises after high-level image feature processing but still during the perceptual process and memory regions in the MTL (hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus) significantly represent memorability judgments. Together, our results provide a detailed spatiotemporal account of the memorability effect at the voxel and region-level and support the levels-of-processing theory linking perception with memory. \n\n\n## 2. Results \n  \n### 2.1. MEG-fMRI fusion maps of the time course of the memorability effect in the brain \n  \nThe effect of image memorability has typically been studied in either time or space, but not both. Here, we document when and where the effect of image memorability propagates throughout the whole-brain with MEG-fMRI fusion [ , , , ], a technique that enables comparison of MEG and fMRI data by mapping them into a common representational space through the calculation of representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) [ ] ( ). By correlating a voxel\u2019s fMRI RDM with each time point\u2019s MEG RDM, we estimate that voxel\u2019s contribution to the MEG signal over time. Repeated for every voxel in the brain, we achieve a matrix of correlations describing visual processing over the whole-brain and time ( ). \n   Whole-brain MEG-fMRI fusion methodology and results.  \n  (A, D) Stimuli examples:   Illustrative examples of experimental stimuli and their High and Low Memorable pairs of the same semantic concept. For example, the bottom images in panels   (A)   and   (D)   show a High Memorable image of \u201ca bike rack outside of a building\u201d and a Low Memorable image of \u201ca bike rack outside of a building,\u201d respectively. The real experimental stimuli are not shown due to copyright protection. The analysis steps   (BC)   and   (EF)   were separately performed on the 78 High Memorable conditions and the 78 Low Memorable conditions, respectively, and are otherwise identical.   (B, E) Computing pairwise dissimilarities:   For the MEG experiment, at each time point   t  , an RDM was computed where the (i,j) indices correspond to a dissimilarity measure (SVM classification accuracy) between condition   i   and condition   j  . For the fMRI experiment, at each voxel   v  , an RDM was computed where the (i,j) indices correspond to a dissimilarity measure (1-Pearson\u2019s R) between the activation patterns within a spherical searchlight (radius of 4 voxels).   (C, F) MEG-fMRI fusion correlation map:   The partial correlation (Spearman\u2019s R) between the MEG RDMs at each time point   t   and the fMRI RDMs at each voxel   v   while regressing out a GIST image feature RDM results in a time series of correlations across the whole-brain while controlling for possible confounding image features.   (G) High Memorable and Low Memorable correlation map difference:   The Low Memorable correlation maps were subtracted from the High Memorable correlation maps to create a new High > Low Difference correlation map over the whole-brain and across time.   (H) High > Low Memorable fusion results:   Axial slices of the brain at 56 mm and 26 mm between 250 ms and 600 ms poststimulus onset depict significant differences in correlation between the High Memorable and Low Memorable correlation maps (  n   = 15, cluster-definition threshold   P   < 0.001, significance threshold (alpha)   P   < 0.01, permutations = 1,000). fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; MEG, magnetoencephalography; RDM, representational dissimilarity matrix; SVM, support vector machine. \n  \nWe compute an MEG-fMRI fusion correlation series on the 78 High Memorable conditions ( ) and 78 Low Memorable conditions ( ) separately. Both MEG-fMRI fusion correlation series show significant clusters of correlations onset in the EVC around 80 ms and propagate throughout the visual cortex, as expected from previous works [ , ] (see  ). \n\nWe then subtract the Low Memorable fusion correlation series from the High Memorable fusion correlation series to obtain a spatiotemporal view of sensitivity to image memorability ( ). Since the High and Low Memorable stimuli sets are controlled for high- and low-level perceptual features (see  ), any effect that remains after the High > Low Memorable difference contrast is attributable to the difference in memorability scores. Furthermore, this difference contrast is not biased by hand-selected memorability features in order to provide a general description of memorability sensitivity throughout the whole brain. \n\n shows snapshots of the whole-brain High Memorable > Low Memorable difference fusion (cluster statistics) over the time points 250 to 600 ms in 2 select axial slices highlighting significant differences in correlations distributed throughout the visual cortex. Significant differences in correlations first arise in the posterior temporal lobe at around 275 ms followed by responses in the posterior occipital lobe and lateral occipital lobe at 300 ms. Significant differences in correlations cease by 600 ms (see   for a link to the High Memorable, Low Memorable, and High > Low Memorable difference whole-brain MEG-fMRI fusion movies side-by-side). \n\nOverall, results from this spatially and temporally unconstrained fusion analysis provide evidence that sensitivity to image memorability is distributed throughout visual cortex late in time. This whole-brain MEG-fMRI fusion analysis complements previous MEG-only work showing sensitivities to image memorability late in time [ ] and fMRI-only work showing sensitivity to image memorability near high-level ventral visual stream and posterior temporal lobe (but not in extra-visual regions associated with memory) [ , ]. In contrast to these previous works, we identify voxels sensitive to image memorability in the posterior occipital lobe, a region typically associated with low-level image feature processing. The late and distributed responses warrant region-specific analyses to further quantify onset times and build a clearer picture of the effect of image memorability on visual perception. \n\n\n### 2.2. ROI-based MEG-fMRI fusion shows late onset of image memorability sensitivity \n  \nWe extend the MEG-fMRI fusion analysis to individual ROIs defined for both the fMRI and MEG data to identify which regions are sensitive to image memorability and when they show this sensitivity. We identify 6 non-overlapping ROIs from the Desikan\u2013Killiany atlas [ ] to spatially constrain both the MEG and fMRI data. Specifically, we use the ROIs EVC (combination of lingual gyrus, cuneus cortex, and pericalcarine cortex regions), lateral occipital cortex, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and banks of the STS for their non-overlapping but abutting coverage in or near the ventral visual stream that we beforehand might expect to be sensitive to image memorability [ \u2013 , ]. These ROIs span typical visual regions (EVC, lateral occipital cortex, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus) [ \u2013 ] and nearby multimodal integration regions (middle temporal gyrus and banks of the STS) [ \u2013 ] for broad functional coverage of visual perception. \n\nThe ROI-based MEG-fMRI fusion method (see section 4.8.2) correlates a source-estimated MEG time series of RDMs (see section 4.6.3) with an fMRI RDM (see section 4.7.3) for a given ROI ( , example green ROI is lateral occipital cortex) to obtain a ROI-specific correlation time series for each subject. This procedure is done separately for the High Memorable (red) and Low Memorable conditions (blue) ( ). Subtracting the Low Memorable correlation time series from the High Memorable correlation time series results in the High > Low Memorable Difference correlation time series (orange) ( ). We estimate onset latencies for the High, Low, and High > Low Difference conditions within each ROI using a jackknife-based baseline technique [ \u2013 ]. In detail, the jackknife-based baseline technique computes leave-one-out subsamples and, for each subsample, considers a time point as significant if: (1) the value at that time point exceeds 2 times the baseline standard deviation; and (2) the average value over 10 consecutive 50 ms windows also exceeds 2 times the baseline standard deviation. The first time point that satisfies both criteria is marked as the onset for that subsample (see   section 4.8.2 for more details).   shows the grand-average correlation time series curves, the average onset for each condition (the average of all subsample onsets), and the significant time points for the High, Low, and High > Low difference condition for each ROI (time points where all 15 jackknife subsamples met the 2 criteria). \n   Source-estimated MEG-fMRI ROI fusion correlation time series.  \n (A) ROI MEG-fMRI fusion methods:   For each of the 6 ROIs (in this example, the green ROI is lateral occipital), an fMRI RDM and a source-estimated MEG RDM time series are partially correlated (regressing out the GIST image features) for the High Memorable (red) and Low Memorable (blue) images, separately. The resulting Low Memorable fusion correlation curves are subtracted from the High Memorable fusion correlation curves to compute the High > Low Memorable Difference curve (orange).   (B) Source-estimated MEG-fMRI ROI fusion results:   The 15-subject grand average correlation curves for the High Memorable, Low Memorable, and High > Low Memorable Difference conditions are plotted for 6 ROIs in or abutting the ventral visual stream. The corresponding color-coded horizontal bars above the curves represent the significant time points at which all 15 jackknifed subsamples passed the jackknife-based baseline criteria. The black dots depict the average onset within each High, Low, and High > Low condition, and the color-coded vertical bar depicts the onset\u2019s 95% confidence interval (one-sample   t   test, right-sided, variance corrected for the subsamples). The dotted black vertical lines connect each conditions\u2019 average onset to the x-axis for easier viewing of the onset times. fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; MEG, magnetoencephalography; RDM, representational dissimilarity matrix; ROI, region of interest. \n  \n shows the presence of significant time points in the High > Low Difference correlations for EVC, lateral occipital cortex, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and banks of the STS with an average onset of 303, 415, 278, 368, and 269 ms poststimulus onset, respectively (see   for results for all conditions). This result shows that perception of High Memorable images differs from perception of Low Memorable images in a spatially distributed set of regions late in time. \n\n\n### 2.3. Memorability score magnitude is represented after high-level perception \n  \nIn order to pinpoint when image memorability is represented with respect to the perceptual time course, we use representational similarity analysis (RSA) [ , ] to correlate low-level, high-level, and memorability behavior model RDMs with the source-estimated MEG RDM time series of classical visual processing regions [ , \u2013 ]. To approximate the low-level and high-level image representations of the human visual system, RDMs are computed by extracting the features after the first convolutional layer (here referred to as Conv1) and penultimate fully connected layer (here referred to as FC7) from an AlexNet deep convolutional neural network (DNN) trained on image classification [ ] ( ). To capture the human brain\u2019s behavioral readout of image memorability, a model RDM is computed using the magnitude of difference in memorability scores between each pair of stimuli ( ). \n   Model and source-estimated MEG RSA.  \n (A) Creation of AlexNet layer RDMs:   Features for each of the 156 stimuli were extracted after the first convolution (Conv1, pink) and after the penultimate fully connected layer (FC7, green) in an AlexNet model pretrained on ImageNet. Dissimilarity between each pair of images was measured as 1 \u2013Pearson correlational similarity between the flattened image features and entered into the RDM.   (B) Creation of memorability behavior RDM:   Each value in the   (i  ,  j)   index of the memorability behavior RDM (orange) is the absolute value of the image   i\u2019  s memorability score minus image   j  \u2019s memorability score.   (C) Correlation of model RDMs with MEG RMDs:   The three 156 \u00d7 156 model RDMs (AlexNet Conv1, AlexNet FC7, and memorability behavior) were partially correlated (spearman; Conv1 partialled out FC7, FC7 partialled out Conv1, and memorability behavior partialled out GIST) with the source-estimated MEG time series for each of the 4 typical visual regions. The color-coded horizontal bars above the curves represent the significant time points at which all 15 jackknifed subsamples passed the jackknife-based baseline criteria. The average onset time and 95% confidence interval for each curve are denoted by black dots with a dotted black line extending down to the x-axis (for easier visualization) and a short color-coded vertical bar, respectively. The onset times were computed using a jackknife approach. The latencies between condition onsets are denoted by dual color-coded bars below the curves. The latencies were computed using a two-sided   t   test and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni\u2013Holm procedure (q < 0.05,   n   = 12 comparisons). An asterisk to the right of the latency bar denotes significance, and N.S. denotes \u201cNot Significant.\u201d MEG, magnetoencephalography; RDM, representational dissimilarity matrix; RSA, representational similarity analysis. \n  \nCorrelating a model RDM with a region\u2019s source-estimated MEG RDM time series measures how strongly the ROI shares the model\u2019s representation over time, indicative of the ROI\u2019s underlying neural processes [ , , ]. Crucially, the model and source-estimated MEG RDMs use all 156 image conditions to capture how images across High and Low Memorable conditions are represented. Comparing differences in onset latencies between each of these 3 model representations then allows us to establish a temporal ordering of these neural processes. We restrict this analysis to classical visual regions (EVC, lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, and inferior temporal cortex) for fair comparison with a vision-based model. We compute the conditions\u2019 onsets (as opposed to peaks) to measure the earliest time the conditions are represented in the brain. \n\nWe find that the onset of image memorability processing (orange bar) is later than low-level (pink bar) and\/or high-level (green bar) visual processing in all 4 visual regions by an average of 47 milliseconds and 42 milliseconds, respectively ( ). EVC, lateral occipital cortex, and inferior temporal cortex show the processing of memorability magnitudes occurs significantly later than both low-level and high-level processing, suggesting that the processing of image memorability is temporally distinct, and later than, both low-level and high-level perceptual processing (two-sided   t   test, Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction for 12 comparisons, q < 0.05). In fusiform gyrus, the processing of memorability magnitudes occurs later than the high-level processing. Latency calculations involving the low-level features, especially latency differences between low-level and high-level features, may not have become significant due to larger variability in the low-level features (see   for all onset and latency values). \n\nTogether, this analysis shows that the image memorability representation that reflects behavioral recognition performance arises shortly after high-level visual processing (approximately 42 ms after) but still well within the time period of perceptual processing (approximately 107 ms poststimulus onset). Thus, the behavioral readout of image memorability is a late-stage representation but is still reflected during perception. \n\n\n### 2.4. Memorability score magnitude is reflected in classical memory regions \n  \nTo determine the extent that classical memory regions also represent image memorability, we create RDMs for the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and correlate them with the memorability score magnitude RDM. The hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala compose part of the MTL and are often implicated in encoding, retrieving, and\/or mediating memory [ \u2013 ]. LPFC has been consistently observed to positively respond in subsequent memory literature [ ] and used in prior memorability work to dissociate image memorability from individual memory [ ]. \n\nThe memorability magnitude RDM ( ), also used in the analysis in section 2.3, summarizes the relationship between each pair of images by their difference in ability to be correctly remembered by human observers. \n   Correlation of classical memory fMRI RDMs with memorability magnitude RDM.  \n (A) Correlation analysis:   The 156 \u00d7 156 memorability magnitude RDM is partially correlated (spearman, partialling out GIST features) with each of the 15 subject\u2019s fMRI ROI RDM (in this example, the hippocampus ROI).   (B) Memorability representation in classical memory regions:   For each of the 4 memory regions, the partial correlation (Spearman, GIST features partialled out) between the 15 subjects\u2019 fMRI RDM and the memorability magnitude RDM was computed (black dots). Statistical significance was computed using a right sided   t   test against a null correlation of 0 (q < 0.05, Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction,   n   = 4 comparisons). The boxplot shows the median correlation (red line), 25th and 75th percentile (blue box), and the most extreme non-outlier points (black whiskers). An asterisk above the boxplot denotes significance, and N.S. denotes \u201cNot Significant.\u201d fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; LPFC, left prefrontal cortex; RDM, representational dissimilarity matrix; ROI, region of interest. \n  \nSimilar to [ ], we find that hippocampus (  p   = 2.1e-5), parahippocampal gyrus (  p   = 2.4e-6), and amygdala (  p   = 0.0427) significantly correlate with the memorability magnitude RDM, while LPFC (  p   = 0.1004) does not (right-sided   t   test, Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction for   n   = 4 comparisons, q < 0.05; see   for equivalent nonparametric tests). This result shows the behavioral representation of image memorability is represented in not only visual regions (see section 2.3) but also memory regions. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \n### 3.1. Summary of results \n  \nThis study combines high spatial resolution fMRI with high temporal resolution MEG to provide a unified account of the when and where of the memorability effect throughout the whole brain. Spatiotemporal analyses reveal that sensitivity to image memorability is more distributed than previously thought. We find sensitivity in not only the high-level visual regions of inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex, but also the banks of the STS and EVC. This sensitivity occurs late in visual processing, at approximately 303, 415, 278, 368, and 269 ms for EVC, lateral occipital cortex, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and banks of the STS, respectively. We then analyze the extent classic visual regions and classic memory regions represent a specific model of image memorability based on humans\u2019 image recognition performance. The visual brain represents memorability score magnitudes significantly after high-level features with its first representations emerging approximately 107 ms poststimulus onset, suggesting that the memorability effect arises late in, but during, perception. Additionally, classical memory regions of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala reflect representations of memorability score magnitudes, further showing how visual perception and memory are intertwined. \n\n\n### 3.2. EVC shows sensitivity to image memorability \n  \nBoth our whole-brain MEG-fMRI fusion (section 2.1) and ROI-based MEG-fMRI fusion (section 2.2) analyses exhibit strong agreement that EVC is sensitive to differences in image memorability late in time (around 303 ms poststimulus onset). This result is in contrast with previous work that identifies image memorability as a high-level process different from low-level vision and did not find significant involvement of EVC [ , , ]. Why does this set of MEG-fMRI fusion analyses find significant sensitivity in EVC? \n\nWe first note that this study\u2019s fMRI-only univariate and multivariate analyses (see   and  ), closely resembling the analyses of Bainbridge and colleagues (2017) and Bainbridge and Rissman (2018), also do not appear to show sensitivity in EVC. However, these multivariate analyses show a lack of statistically significant correlation between an EVC voxel\u2019s representational geometry and a specific memorability-related representational geometry. Such an analysis is not sufficient to conclude that EVC is not sensitive to any aspects of image memorability. \n\nThe MEG-fMRI fusion analysis, on the other hand, can be viewed as testing 1,201 representational geometries (one for each MEG time point) that do not necessarily reflect high-level theories of memorability, but rather representations defined by the MEG signal at a time point. Thus, it is likely that EVC is sensitive to image memorability, but its representational geometry corresponds to a more intermediate level of processing best brought out by the MEG time points\u2019 representational geometries, not the memorability theories previously tested. \n\nA second (not mutually exclusive) possible explanation as to why we see significant late correlational differences in EVC may be due to the temporal limitations of fMRI. The temporally coarse and sluggish BOLD response captured at each voxel in EVC, and subsequently its RDM, is likely dominated by a strong representational geometry corresponding to its initial low-level visual processing early in time. If the signal of EVC\u2019s sensitivity to differences in image memorability is weaker than the signal of EVC\u2019s initial low-level visual processing, the memorability effect\u2019s representational contribution to the overall EVC RDM would be present but relatively weak. MEG\u2019s temporally resolved representational geometries, as utilized in MEG-fMRI fusion analyses, may be able to highlight EVC\u2019s memorability representation. \n\n\n### 3.3. Spatiotemporal results support the levels-of-processing theory of memory \n  \nOur results support the levels-of-processing theory of memory, which posits that a stimulus\u2019s better encoding into and retrieval from memory is a consequence of deeper levels of perceptual processing [ , ]. Results show the memorability effect is distributed across regions around the occipital cortex often implicated in perception (sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4). The memorability score magnitude RDM is first reflected in visual ROIs after high-level feature processing but still during perception (approximately 107 ms after stimulus onset) (section 2.3), and significant High Memorable and Low Memorable differences are observed at even later time points (approximately 300 ms depending on the ROI) (section 2.2). Finally, we show the memorability score magnitude RDM is significantly represented in both classical visual regions (section 2.3) and classical memory regions in the MTL (but not LPFC) (section 2.4). Together, we show that the memorability effect is observed in both visual and memory regions and characterized by spatially distributed and temporally extended perceptual processing strongly suggestive of increased processing depth [ , ]. \n\nMarrying our results with previous literature, we propose that both High and Low Memorable images are similarly processed in an initial feedforward pass through the visual perceptual hierarchy [ , ] to extract their low-level (e.g., spatial frequency, color, contrast) and high-level (e.g., shapes, concepts) properties. The high-level visual regions at the end stages of the initial visual perception, specifically the inferior temporal cortex ( , middle left panel) and banks of the STS ( , lower right panel) seen here at around 278 ms and 269 ms, respectively, may preferentially process High Memorable images due to their relatively more conceptually [ , ] and socially [ , ] useful information content [ ]. \n\nBanks of the STS, with its strong feedback connections to EVC [ , ], may then project the signal back to EVC at approximately 303 ms ( , top left). EVC may serve to extract additional fine details of High Memorable images for extended processing and eventual encoding to or retrieval from memory, in line with EVC\u2019s known involvement in high-order perception [ , , , , ], retention of fine details in memory [ \u2013 ], and our results showing temporally distinct onsets between low-level, high-level, and memorability behavior representations (see section 2.3). Thus, we hypothesize that High Memorable images are subject to deeper levels of processing in order to extract additional relevant details in line with levels-of-processing theory. \n\n\n### 3.4. Limitations and future work \n  \nThe correlation between the MEG and fMRI RDMs in the MEG-fMRI fusion method amplifies the noise present in both MEG and fMRI signals, thus requiring a higher signal-to-noise ratio for MEG-fMRI fusion to attain statistical significance. Moreover, MEG-fMRI fusion only captures neural activity present in both MEG and fMRI separately. Thus, analyses along only the temporal dimension using MEG data or only the spatial dimension using fMRI data will likely yield stronger signal. Conversely, these limitations have the benefit of making the MEG-fMRI fusion technique conservative, meaning that any statistically significant results are more likely to be true effects. \n\nAll spatial information stems from fMRI and all temporal information stems from MEG, which theoretically can result in spatially and temporally ambiguous representational correlations [ ]. Incorporating temporal information in the fMRI data or spatial information in the MEG data is the best way to resolve any potential ambiguity. While our slow (2 second TR) fMRI acquisition did not allow for a useful increase in temporal resolution in the fMRI data, we did increase the spatial resolution of the MEG data using source-estimation in order to minimize any potential ambiguity. Furthermore, even without incorporating temporal resolution in fMRI and spatial resolution in MEG, MEG-fMRI fusion has been shown to produce reliable spatiotemporal signals both across studies and subjects [ \u2013 ]. MEG-fMRI fusion results also demonstrate strong agreement with independently collected spatiotemporal results [ , , \u2013 ]. \n\nThe goal of our ROI analysis was to broadly test the ventral visual cortex, abutting regions, and classical memory regions that may be implicated in visual perception. A study selecting ROIs to test specific hypotheses of an ROI\u2019s contribution to the memorability effect can yield impactful results. Achieving source-estimated temporal information in the memory regions of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala would have allowed us to further elucidate the interplay between perception and memory, but due to the medial anatomical location of these ROIs, such MEG source-estimated information was not possible to obtain. Promising future directions include defining a temporal hierarchy for the memorability effect in light of the strong evidence of feedback processes (see section 2.2 and 2.3; [ ]). Additionally, there exist many categories that might ecologically benefit from a stronger encoding into memory. We wonder if regions when sensitive to image memorability show categorical preferences, as in object recognition [ ], or are agnostic to categorical information. Identifying the memorability effect\u2019s relationship to object recognition and memory encoding and retrieval would be a dramatic step forward in understanding human visual cognition. \n\n\n### 3.5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this work, we elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of image memorability sensitivity in the brain by combing the high temporal resolution of MEG with the high spatial resolution of fMRI. We find sensitivity to image memorability in EVC, inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, and the banks of the STS, and we quantify onset times of sensitivity to image memorability in relation to stimulus onset. We find that High Memorable images are preferentially processed in high-level visual regions [ \u2013 , ] and EVC late in time (but not in extra-perceptual regions). The behavioral readout of image memorability is represented after high-level feature processing in visual regions and significantly represented in classical memory regions in the MTL. In support of the levels-of-processing theory of memory, we hypothesize that High Memorable images undergo additional perceptual processing to extract detailed conceptually and socially relevant information for better encoding and retrieval from memory. \n\n\n\n## 4. Materials and methods \n  \n### 4.1. Participants \n  \nFifteen healthy volunteers (9 female, 27.87 \u00b1 5.17 years old) participated in this experiment. All participants were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and provided written consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local Institutional Review Board ethics committee (Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (COUHES) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, approval code: 1510287948). \n\n\n### 4.2. Stimuli \n  \nWe selected 78 pairs of images (for a total of 156 images) from the LaMem Memorability dataset [ ] and the 10K USA Adult Faces [ ] to form a categorically diverse stimulus set. Each pair contained 1 High Memorable image and 1 Low Memorable image matched for high-level semantic description. \n\nThe 78 High Memorable images and 78 Low Memorable images showed no significant differences in the low-level features of color and spatial frequency (see  ) [ \u2013 ]. An image\u2019s memorability score ranges from 0 to 1 and is calculated as the decimal percentage of correct image recognition trials during a behavioral memory experiment, averaged over all participants [ ]. In this study, the memorability scores are 0.854 +\/\u2212 0.089 for images in the High Memorable set and 0.519 +\/\u2212 0.105 for those in the Low Memorable set. \n\nA memorability score magnitude RDM was computed from the stimuli\u2019s memorability scores to reflect how each pair of images differed from one another based on human results from the memory experiment. For each pair of images   i   and   j  , the difference in magnitudes of their memorability score was entered into index (  i  ,  j  ) of the memorability behavior RDM. For example, 2 images   i   and   j   that were recognized equally well (i.e., the same memorability score) were represented with 0 dissimilarity at index (  i  ,  j)   in the RDM. This memorability magnitude RDM was used to measure the extent that this specific behavioral readout of memorability was represented in a cortical region. \n\n\n### 4.3. GIST and AlexNet stimuli features \n  \nWe computed summary image statistics for each stimuli using the GIST descriptor [ , ]. These GIST features provided an additional control against image-feature confounds between the High Memorable and Low Memorable image sets not accounted for by our matching of semantics, color, and spatial frequency (see  ). Specifically, the GIST features were computed by applying a series of Gabor filters across 8 orientations and 4 spatial frequencies to each image. Each image was then windowed using a 4 \u00d7 4 grid to result in a 512 \u00d7 1 vector. \n\nWe computed a High Memorable and Low Memorable GIST RDM, each of size 78 \u00d7 78, by calculating the pairwise distance (1 \u2013Pearson correlation) between the GIST features of the 78 High Memorable and 78 Low Memorable images, respectively. We used the High and Low Memorable GIST RDMs for partial correlation analysis (for sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) as the potentially confounding variable to control for the possibility that GIST image features, not differences in memorability scores, drove the correlations seen in the results below. See   for a visualization of the High and Low Memorable GIST RDMs. \n\nWe extracted stimuli features from the deep convolutional neural network AlexNet [ ] provided by PyTorch pretrained to classify images from ImageNet [ ]. Specifically, stimuli features were extracted after the first convolutional layer and after the penultimate fully connected layer, respectively, termed \u201cfeatures.0\u201d and \u201cclassifiers.4\u201d in the model definition. Separately for each layer, the features were flattened and the pairwise dissimilarity (1 \u2013Pearson correlation) was computed between each stimulus\u2019s feature vector and entered into an RDM. In this way, we created a 78 \u00d7 78 high memorable RDM, 78 \u00d7 78 low memorable RDM, and a 156 \u00d7 156 all conditions RDM for the AlexNet layers. The features from the first convolutional layer in AlexNet (referred to as Conv1 here) reflect low-level image features, and the features from the penultimate fully connected layer (referred to as FC7 here) reflect high-level image features useful to probe interpretable representations in the primate visual cortex [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n### 4.4. Region of interest selection \n  \nWe defined a total of 10 non-overlapping ROIs, 9 from the Desikan\u2013Killiany Atlas [ ] and 1 spherical ROI following Bainbridge and colleagues (2017) [ ]. The Desikan\u2013Killiany Atlas used to define the fMRI ROIs was downloaded from the AtlasReader [ ] GitHub page ( ) in the filepath \u201catlasreader\/atlasreader\/data\/atlases\/atlas_desikan_killiany.nii.gz.\u201d The atlas was created by converting FreeSurfer\u2019s (version 6.0) [ ] \u201caparc+aseg.mgz\u201d file output from the FreeSurfer folder \u201csubjects\/cvs_avg35_inMNI152\/mri\u201d into a standard NifTi file using FreeSurfer\u2019s mri_convert function. The labels follow FreeSurfer\u2019s \u201cFreeSurferColorLUT.txt\u201d file. Six of the 9 Desikan\u2013Killiany Atlas [ ] ROIs spanned the ventral visual stream where we a priori might have expected to see sensitivities to image memorability [ , , ]. Namely, we defined EVC (which was made by concatenating estimated cortical signals in Lingual, Cueneus, and Pericalcarine), lateral occipital, inferior temporal, middle temporal, fusiform, and banks of the STS [ ]. We used these same ROIs for MEG source-estimation and fMRI ROI analyses. The remaining 3 ROIs from the Desikan\u2013Killiany Atlas [ ] were the classical memory regions of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. Finally, we defined the memory region of LPFC as a spherical ROI with radius 4 voxels centered around MNI coordinate (\u221250, 9, 31), as in Bainbridge and colleagues (2017) [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.5. Experimental procedure \n  \nfMRI and MEG data were acquired in separate sessions (session orders were counterbalanced) and followed presentation parameters optimized for each imaging modality. Participants passively viewed the stimuli during 1 MEG session and 2 fMRI sessions while engaged in an orthogonal vigilance task. In all sessions, images were presented at the center of the screen at 6.0\u00b0 visual angle with 500 ms duration, overlaid with a black fixation cross. Subjects were not informed that images had different memorability scores. \n\nFor fMRI, participants completed 2 sessions of 5 to 8 runs of 610 s each (totaling 11 to 15 runs over both sessions). Each image was presented once per run and image order was randomized. Null trials occurred 25% of the time, where the fixation cross against a gray background was white for 100 ms before returning to its black color for the remainder of the trial. Participants were instructed to respond to the change in fixation color with a button press. Image and null trials were both 3 s (500 ms stimulus display 2.5 s fixation only). \n\nFor MEG, participants completed 1 session of 25 runs, with trials of 1 to 1.2 s each. Each image was presented once per run in a randomized order. Null trials occurred randomly every 3 to 5 trials and consisted of an image of an eye. Subjects were instructed to only blink on these null trials and respond with a button press. \n\n\n### 4.6. MEG acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### 4.6.1. MEG acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMEG signals were acquired from 306 channels (204 planar gradiometers, 102 magnetometers, Elekta Neuromag TRIUX, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) using a sampling rate of 1 kHz, filtered between 0.03 and 330 Hz. We applied temporal source space separation (maxfilter software, Elekta, Stockholm) [ , ] before analyzing data with Brainstorm [ ]. For each trial, we extracted peri-stimulus data from \u2212200 ms to +1,000 ms, removed baseline mean, and smoothed data with a 30 Hz low pass filter. We obtained 25 trials for each condition, session, and participant. \n\n\n#### 4.6.2. MEG multivariate pattern analysis \n  \nWe conducted MEG multivariate pattern analysis on each subject data independently ( ). First, we extracted preprocessed MEG signals from 200 ms before to 1,000 ms after stimulus onset and arranged the 306 sensor measurements in 306-dimensional vector patterns at each time point. This yields N pattern vectors per time point and stimulus condition. We then trained linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers (LibSVM implementation,  ) to discriminate patterns between any 2 conditions. Following previous works [ , , , ], we binned MEG trials randomly into groups of 3 for each condition. To reduce noise and computational complexity, we averaged the trials assigned to each bin, resulting in M pseudo trials [ , \u2013 ]. Then, at each time point and for each pair of conditions, we assigned M-1 pseudo trials for training the SVM classifier. The trained SVM was then tested on the Mth left out vector from each of the 2 conditions. The random assignment to bins, sub-averaging, training and testing procedure were repeated for 100 times. The classifier performance (decoding accuracy), shown to be a reliable and high-SNR dissimilarity index [ ], over the 100 iterations was averaged and used to populate a 156 \u00d7 156 matrix, each row and conditions indexed by the stimulus conditions. This procedure yielded one 156 \u00d7 156 symmetric matrix of decoding accuracies for every time point, referred to as MEG representational dissimilarity matrix (MEG RDM). Extracting the pairwise decoding accuracies of just the High Memorable conditions and just the Low Memorable conditions yields two 78 \u00d7 78 MEG RDMs per time point. \n\n\n#### 4.6.3. MEG source-estimation \n  \nWe mapped MEG signals to cortical sources using default anatomy [ ] and based on Freesurfer automatic segmentation [ ]. Performing multivariate pattern analysis on MEG signals in the 6 cortical regions of interest, we localized MEG representational information on that region. For source localization, using an overlapping spheres model [ ], we first computed the forward model and then mapped MEG signals on the cortex using a dynamic statistical parametric mapping (dSPM) approach [ ]. Pattern vectors in each of the 6 cortical regions were then extracted and employed for a multivariate pattern analysis in that region. Source-estimation was computed separately for the left and right hemispheres of each region. Once the RDM time series was computed for each hemisphere and region, the left and right hemispheres were combined. \n\n\n\n### 4.7. fMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### 4.7.1. fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nBoth sessions were conducted at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the MIT McGovern Institute, using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel phased-array head coil. In each session, we acquired structural images using a standard T1-weighted sequence (176 sagittal slices, FOV = 256 mm , TR = 2530 ms, TE = 2.34 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0). Across the 2 sessions, we acquired 11 to 15 runs of 305 volumes for each participant (gradient-echo EPI sequence: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 29 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV read = 200 mm, FOV phase = 100%, bandwidth 2,368 Hz\/Px, gap = 20%, resolution = 3.1 mm isotropic, slices = 33, ascending acquisition). \n\nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM software (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, University College London). For each participant, fMRI data were slice-time corrected, realigned and co-registered to the T1 structural scan of the first session, and finally normalized to the standard MNI space. We fit a general linear model (GLM) to estimate the fMRI responses to the 156 images. Stimulus onsets and durations, as well as motion and run regressors were included in the GLM. All the regressors were convolved with a hemodynamic response function (canonical HRF) with time resolution of TR\/N and onset of the first slice (TR = 2,000 msec,   N   = 33 slices). \n\n\n#### 4.7.2. fMRI voxelwise searchlight analysis \n  \nWe obtained 156 condition-specific t-maps by computing the contrast of each condition\u2019s GLM estimate against an implicit baseline. We then computed a searchlight analysis [ , ] to calculate an RDM at every voxel for each subject ( ). Specifically, we defined a spherical searchlight of radius 4 voxels and centered it on voxel   v  . Following previous work [ , , ], the condition-specific t-values were extracted from all voxels within the searchlight, and the dissimilarities between each condition were calculated (1-Pearson\u2019s R) to obtain an RDM of shape (156 \u00d7 156) for voxel   v  . Each row   i   and column   j   of the RDM corresponded to a specific condition, and the   (i  ,  j)   index into the RDM was the dissimilarity measure between condition   i   and condition   j  . The searchlight sphere was then moved to the next voxel, and the procedure was repeated until an RDM was calculated at each voxel. This searchlight analysis was performed on each subject separately. \n\n\n#### 4.7.3. fMRI ROI searchlight analysis \n  \nTo obtain 1 RDM for each of the 6 ROIs, we averaged the individual voxel RDMs (from the whole-brain searchlight procedure detailed in Methods section 4.7.2) contained within the corresponding ROI mask. We repeated this procedure for each subject separately. \n\n\n#### 4.8. MEG-fMRI fusion \n  \nM\/EEG-fMRI fusion uses RSA [ , ] to relate temporally resolved MEG or EEG signal with spatially resolved fMRI signal [ , , , , ]. The method assumes that if 2 images are similarly represented in MEG patterns, they should also be similarly represented in fMRI patterns. Translating this neural data into representational space allows us to connect a location in the brain to a particular time point. This creates a spatiotemporally resolved view of the emergence of a specific visual representation in the brain. \n\n\n#### 4.8.1. Whole-brain MEG-fMRI fusion \n  \nWe used a partial correlation analysis to correlate the fMRI RDMs at each voxel (as described in section 4.7.2) with the whole-brain MEG RDMs (as described in section 4.6.2) while regressing out the GIST image feature RDMs (as described in section 4.3) ( ) in order to control for low and mid-level image features not explicitly accounted for in the stimulus set. In line with previous work [ , ], analysis was conducted on the subject-averaged MEG RDMs with the subject-specific fMRI RDMs. For each time point, we computed the similarity (Spearman\u2019s R, thus avoiding scaling issues and parametric assumptions) between the MEG RDM and the fMRI RDM of each voxel while controlling for the potentially confounding GIST image features. This yielded a 3D correlation map of representational similarities, indicating locations in the brain at which neuronal processing emerged at a particular time point. Repeating this analysis for each time point creates a spatiotemporally resolved view of neural activity in the brain during perception free of any spatial priors. \n\nWe computed MEG-fMRI fusion separately for High Memorable and Low Memorable conditions by using their respective MEG, fMRI, and GIST High and Low Memorable RDMs. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the effect of image memorability was the difference between the High and Low Memorable MEG-fMRI fusion time series ( ). Nonparametric permutation-based cluster correction statistics (  n   = 15, cluster-definition threshold   P   < 0.001, significance threshold (alpha)   P   < 0.01, permutations = 1,000, right-tailed) were used to identify significant spatial and temporal clusters for the 4D (voxel X, voxel Y, voxel Z, time point t) correlational fusion series [ , ]. Specifically, we first computed a mean 4D correlation map by averaging each subject\u2019s 4D correlation map. Next, we used each voxel\u2019s values in the baseline period (\u2212200 to 0 ms) in the mean correlation map to empirically construct a distribution of the null hypothesis. We estimated a maximal cluster size threshold by randomly shuffling the signs of each subject\u2019s data 1,000 times, averaging over the subjects, and defining clusters by the values\u2019 spatial and temporal proximity at the cluster-definition threshold (defined to be right-sided,   P   = 0.001). An empirical distribution of the maximal cluster size was computed via permutation sampling and a cluster size threshold of   P   = 0.01. A cluster is significant if it exceeds the cluster size threshold. \n\n\n#### 4.8.2. Source-estimated MEG-fMRI ROI fusion \n  \nROI-based MEG-fMRI fusion, as used in this study, first required the calculation of source-estimated MEG-fMRI fusion. We first computed a given ROI\u2019s source-estimated MEG RDM time series (as described in section 4.6.3). We then computed a given ROI\u2019s fMRI RDM by averaging each voxel\u2019s RDM contained within the ROI mask (as described in section 4.7.3). Finally, we performed a partial correlation between the subject-averaged MEG ROI RDMs at each time point and the subject-specific fMRI ROI RDM with the GIST RDM serving as the potentially confounding variable. This procedure resulted in a correlation time series for each ROI of size 15 \u00d7 1,201 (n_subjects \u00d7 n_timepoints). \n\nWhen determining the onset latencies of the ROI fusion correlation time series, we faced 2 main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (as common with most neuroimaging data) and no prior knowledge of the signal\u2019s canonical shape. We addressed these 2 challenges using a jackknife-based baseline criteria technique. Starting with an ROI correlation time series matrix of size 15 \u00d7 1,201 (n_subjects \u00d7 n_timepoints), we followed previous work to identify significant latencies [ \u2013 ]. \n\nFirst, we computed the standard deviation of the baseline values across time (\u2212200 to 0 ms) from the 15-subject grand-averaged correlation time series to establish the baseline criteria. Next, we iterated over each subject to compute 15 subsamples of leave-one-out mini grand averages, where each of the remaining 14 subjects are averaged at each iteration (jackknife) [ ]. For each of the jackknifed subsamples, a time point t was considered significant if it satisfied 2 criteria [ , ]: (1) the value at time point t was greater than or equal to 2 times the baseline standard deviation; and (2) the average value of the next 10 windows of t + 50 ms was also greater than or equal to 2 times the baseline standard deviation. The first significant time point for each of the 15 jackknifed subsamples was the onset for that subsample. This procedure resulted in 15 samples of onset latencies per condition. \n\nThe strict baseline criteria ensured that significant time points satisfy an amplitude criterion (2 times the baseline standard deviation) and a temporal grouping criterion (10 moving windows of 50 ms) that noise was unlikely to satisfy, and the jackknifing procedure increased the signal-to-noise ratio to better estimate signals with non-canonical shapes. For an ROI\u2019s High Memorable, Low Memorable, or High > Low Memorable curves to be considered significant, at least 1 time point must exist where all 15 subsamples passed the 2 criteria. Otherwise, the correlation curve was considered not significant. \n\nSince the subsamples were no longer independent, we adjusted the variance by multiplying by a factor of (  n  \u20141) [ ] (where   n   = 15) when computing subsequent statistics (for detailed proof and discussion of this adjustment, see [ , , ]). The mean onset latency of each condition and ROI was computed by averaging the onset latencies of the 15 subsamples. The 95% confidence interval around the onset latency for each condition and ROI was computed by multiplying the standard error of the onset latencies (with the adjusted variance) by a critical t-statistic of 2.145 to represent a 95% confidence interval with 14 degrees of freedom. Onset latencies were computed with a one-sided 1 sample   t   test (against an onset of 0 ms, stimulus onset), and onset latency differences between conditions (as in section 2.3) were computed with a two-sided paired   t   test. \n\nStatistical tests for latency differences between conditions (section 2.3) and memorability magnitude to memory RDM correlations (section 2.4) were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction (  n   = 12 tests and   n   = 4 tests, respectively) at q = 0.05 [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10984539,"text_md5":"14d722a2edf9517d2cfab4364b2c1ac3","field_positions":{"authors":[0,75],"journal":[76,85],"publication_year":[87,91],"title":[102,250],"keywords":[264,264],"abstract":[277,2041],"body":[2050,54699]},"batch":1,"pmid":38557761,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pbio.3002564","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10984539","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10984539"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10984539\">10984539<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10984539  Visual perception of highly memorable images is mediated by a distributed network of ventral visual regions that enable a late memorability response"}

Although seizures originate in mesial temporal structures, there are widespread abnormalities of gray and white matter beyond the temporal lobes that negatively impact functional networks and cognition. Previous studies have focused either on the global impact on functional networks, or on the functional correlates of specific cognitive abilities. Here, we use a two-pronged approach to evaluate the link between whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) anomalies to overall cognitive performance, and how such abnormal connectivity alters the fronto-parietal brain regions involved in working memory (WMem), a cognitive disability often reported by TLE patients. We evaluated 31 TLE patients and 35 healthy subjects through extensive cognitive testing, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), and task-based fMRI using Sternberg\u2019s task to evaluate WMem. As a group, TLE patients displayed cognitive abnormalities across different domains, although considerable within-group variability was identified. TLE patients showed disruptions of functional networks between and within the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks (TPN) resulting in associations with cognitive performance. Furthermore, during the WMem task, TLE patients showed abnormal activity of fronto-parietal regions that were associated with other forms of memory, and alterations of seed-based connectivity analyses. Our results show that different degrees of abnormal functional brain activity and connectivity are related to the severity of disabilities across cognitive spheres. Differential co-activation patterns between patients and healthy subjects suggest potential compensatory mechanisms to preserve adequate cognitive performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy [ ]. TLE seizures are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and due to this, TLE usually entails large detrimental effects on the quality of life of patients, affecting their physical and mental health, with a wide spectrum of cognitive deficits [ ,  ]. Long-term memory deficits are one of the most frequent concerns in these patients [ ,  ], with self-reported memory being an important predictor of quality of life that correlates with objective performance on memory tests [ ]. Notably, cognitive deficits are already present in newly-diagnosed epilepsy in children [ ], with potential for further deterioration due to long-term pharmacological treatment [ ]. A large body of research has reported that TLE patients typically undergo difficulties in their ability to recall, often displaying important short- and long-term memory deficits [ ]. It is also well known that the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes play critical roles in declarative memories [ ,  ]. Indeed, patients who exhibit neuronal loss, volume reduction, and gliosis in mesial temporal structures (mesiotemporal sclerosis, MTS) also display the most severe deficits in short- and long-term memory [ ,  ]. Notably, structural and functional abnormalities are not restricted to the temporal lobe, with a large body of evidence showing alterations widespread throughout the brain, comprising neocortical thinning, atrophy of subcortical structures, and abnormalities of white matter [ \u2013 ]. Such widespread alterations are linked to deficits in cognitive domains not necessarily or exclusively linked to temporal lobe function, such as executive functions, attention, and working memory [ \u2013 ]. \n\nResting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been used to show abnormalities of the default mode network (DMN), attention, and reward\/emotion networks that may partially explain cognitive deficits across domains [ ,  ]. Cognitive abilities of healthy participants are correlated with the adequate interplay of the DMN and task-positive networks (TPN) [ ,  ]. Nonetheless, it is unknown how the altered networks of TLE patients modulate the interaction between large-scale functional connectivity (FC) and specific cognitive abilities. \n\nThe concept of working memory (WMem) was first described by Miller in 1960 and refers to a type of short-term memory which has a crucial cognitive function that supports ongoing and upcoming behaviors, allowing storage of information across delay periods [ ]. A basic feature of WMem is the maintenance of information in the short term in the absence of any sensory input [ ]. This means that once the information is presented, the individual is able to retain and manipulate it without the stimulus remaining present. WMem is a basic component of complex cognitive functions such as learning and reasoning [ ]. Crucially, WMem does not appear to involve temporal lobe structures, but rather maintenance of information in WMem is carried out within a fronto-parietal network [ ]. WMem appears to be further impaired in patients with left TLE with hippocampal sclerosis, early onset of the disorder, and high frequency of seizures [ ]. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has shown bilateral activation of the frontal and parietal lobes using paradigms to evaluate WMem (e.g., N-back) [ ], and such activity is impaired in TLE patients [ ,  ]. In healthy subjects, the hippocampus is normally bilaterally deactivated during WMem tasks, and the level of such deactivation is dependent on memory load. Interestingly, this pattern is abnormal in patients with TLE [ ]. While group studies have shown that TLE patients have WMem deficits [ \u2013 ], the impact of WMem patterns of network co-activity on overall cognitive performance of TLE patients is unknown. \n\nIn this work, we explored the association between brain function and cognitive performance in TLE patients using two complementary approaches. First, we explore the link between cognitive scores across domains with the activity of resting-state functional networks. Next, we use task-based fMRI to specifically investigate WMem abilities and fronto-parietal network co-activity. Finally, we investigate the interplay between WMem networks resulting from task-fMRI and those derived from resting-state fMRI, and how both impact on overall cognitive abilities. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited a sample of 31 patients with TLE, previously reported in [ ] (age 10 \u00b1 11 years old, 22 women). Patients were diagnosed and followed at out-patient epilepsy clinics at Hospital General de M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, and at Hospital Central \u201cDr. Ignacio Morones Prieto\u201d in San Luis Potos\u00ed, M\u00e9xico. The referring neurologists diagnosed the patients according to ILAE criteria, relying on clinical information, surface EEG, and conventional neuroimaging. Based on electroclinical and neuroimaging data, the laterality of the epileptogenic focus was determined, resulting in 19 left-TLE, and 12 right-TLE. Seventeen patients had imaging evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. None of the patients were at the time using barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or topiramate\u2014all known to affect cognitive functions. The control group consisted of 35 healthy subjects matched for age and education (age 33 \u00b1 12 years old; 17 women) without any history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. All participants were right-handed. Specific sample sizes differed between sub-analyses, as indicated below, summarized in  , and annotated in the accompanying dataset. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Neurobiology and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Human Subjects. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological assessment \n  \nParticipants underwent extensive cognitive assessment at Hospital General de M\u00e9xico and Centro Estatal de Salud Mental, Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico, which was conducted by experienced neuropsychologists. Two scales were used: Wechsler\u2019s Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and Weschsler\u2019s Memory Scale (WMS-IV). Scores of these tests were reported as percentiles adjusted for age and education level based on the Mexican population. Derived from these two scales, we used nine indices as measurements of performance on specific cognitive domains: verbal comprehension (VCI), perceptual reasoning (PR), processing speed (PSI), working memory (WMI), visual memory (VMI), visual working memory (VWMI), immediate memory (IMI), delayed memory (DMI), and auditory memory (AMI). \n\n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nWe acquired resting-state (RS) and task-fMRI sequences. Studies were performed on a 3 T Philips Achieva TX scanner (Best, The Netherlands) at the National Laboratory for MRI, located at Instituto de Neurobiolog\u00eda, UNAM Campus Juriquilla, Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico. For the acquisition of RS-fMRI, participants were instructed to close their eyes, stay still and relaxed, and to stay awake during the scanning session. Gradient-echo echo-planar T2*-weighted images (TR\/TE = 2000\/30 ms) were acquired covering the whole brain with 34 slices, with a voxel resolution of 2\u00d72\u00d73 mm\u00b3 (200 volumes; 6 minutes 40 seconds). Similarly, task-fMRI (190 volumes; 6 minutes 20 seconds) was acquired with the same scan parameters while subjects performed the Sternberg memory task (described below). For registration purposes, we also acquired high-resolution T1-weighted images with 1\u00d71\u00d71mm\u00b3 voxel size using a 3D magnetization-prepared gradient echo sequence (TR\/TE = 8.1\/3.7 ms; flip angle = 8\u00b0). Additionally, other structural and DWI sequences were acquired and described elsewhere [ ,  ]. We conducted a quality assessment on fMRI images, and the exclusion criteria for subjects were independent for each modality. Therefore, the number of included subjects differs slightly between RS-fMRI and task-fMRI analyses and is reported in each section (these subsamples did not differ on sex, age, and education levels). \n\n\n### Sternberg\u2019s memory task \n  \nWe used a modified version of Sternberg\u2019s memory task [ ] which was introduced to participants prior to the imaging session, making sure they understood and complied with the task. Participants laid on the scanner and viewed a series of slides through a mirror affixed to the MRI head coil. Each trial consisted of three slides ( ), which were presented using E-Prime version 2 (Psychology software tools, Sharpsburg, PA): The first slide showed a list of either 2, 4, or 6 digits which participants were instructed to memorize (encoding phase, 4 s duration); the second slide showed only three dots that indicated that the previous list of digits must be retained in memory (retention phase, 10 s); the last slide showed a single digit between question marks, and the subject was asked to respond whether that specific digit was included in the list of digits seen in the first slide (retrieval phase, 4 s). A total of 12 trials with different memory loads and digits in each list were evaluated per participant, with an inter-trial period of 18 seconds. Participants provided their response (yes\/no) through MRI-compatible triggers (Nordic NeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) by pressing a button with either index finger; the side indicating yes or no was counterbalanced between participants. Participants were instructed to provide their responses as quickly as possible. The number of correct responses and the reaction times were analyzed as measures of performance in the task, through mixed 2x3 analyses of variance (ANOVA) considering group (TLE or Control) as the between-subjects factor and memory load (2, 4, or 6 digits) as the within-subjects factor. Statistical significance was considered at a p-value < 0.05. \n   Sternberg memory task for evaluation of WMem.    \n\n### Resting-state fMRI preprocessing \n  \nRS-fMRI datasets were preprocessed with the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC v.1.1.8) [ ], set with the default parameters with minimal adjustments based on [ ,  ]. The preprocessing pipeline included the following procedures: slice-timing correction for an interleaved acquisition, motion correction, skull and non-brain tissue removal, alignment of functional timeseries to the anatomical T1-weighted volume, nuisance artifact removal (nuisance regression), spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing. The matrix of nuisance regressors included linear and quadratic trends, white matter (WM) mean intensity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mean intensity, the top 6 principal components derived from WM and CSF signal (aCompcor), motion parameters and their derivatives [ ], and 0.01\u20130.08 Hz bandpass filtering. Additionally, framewise displacement (FD) was calculated from rigid motion parameters, and timepoints whose FD value was greater than 0.25 were marked as spikes and added to the nuisance regressors matrix (volume censoring or soft scrubbing) to prevent spurious results in posterior analyses. Following nuisance regression, residuals were spatially normalized and warped to the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 atlas (MNI152, voxel resolution of 2x2x2 mm\u00b3), and data was spatially smoothed through the application of a gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM. After visual quality assessment of preprocessed data, datasets with excessive head motion, defined as remaining with less than 120 non censored timepoints (i.e., less than 4 minutes of usable signal) were discarded from the study. \n\n\n### Definition of DMN and TPN regions of interest \n  \nRegions of interest (ROIs) of DMN and TPN were obtained from neurosynth.org [ ]. Briefly, we selected the MNI152 seed voxel coordinates, x = -8, y = -56, z = 26, corresponding to the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) [ ]. Seed coordinates were then used in the neurosynth\u2019s locations tool to generate a seed-based Pearson coefficient correlation whole-brain map based on a sample of 1000 RS-fMRI datasets (see   for more details). Next, the seed map was thresholded, keeping only r values lower than -0.25 or greater than 0.25, and the remaining voxels were grouped into clusters, resulting in 21 clusters, 8 corresponding to DMN regions and the remaining 13 corresponding to task-positive regions (DMN anticorrelations). For the purpose of analyzing regions with an equivalent number of voxels, these clusters were used as a template to generate 4mm radius spherical ROIs centered at each cluster\u2019s local maxima (see  ). \n   Regions of interest.  \nSpatial coordinates of local maxima in MNI space (mm). \n    \n\n### Functional connectivity and network analysis \n  \nOut of the 53 preprocessed RS-fMRI subjects, 2 were excluded due to severe signal dropout in the temporal lobes, and 5 were discarded due to an insufficient number of volumes after data scrubbing. Consequently, data from 46 subjects remained usable. Among them, 25 were controls (18 women), and 21 were patients (14 women, 12 with left-TLE, 9 with right-TLE). To enhance the sensitivity of our analyses, given the substantial exclusion of TLE datasets, we formed a homogeneous TLE group by flipping the brains (inverting the x-axis of images) of right TLE patients. This approach, widely employed in epilepsy studies [ ,  ,  ], increases sensitivity at the expense of reduced specificity. Therefore, the results of RS-fMRI analyses are referenced to the location of the epileptogenic focus (ipsilateral\/contralateral) rather than to the hemispheric (left\/right) location of brain regions. The ROIs mean timeseries were extracted from each preprocessed RS-fMRI dataset, and we obtained 21x21 FC matrices through the calculation of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between timeseries of each pair of ROIs. We then carried out statistical comparisons of FC between patients and controls, through node-based and network-based approaches. For the node-based approach, matrices were linearized and FC from each pair of nodes was compared between groups, yielding computation of multiple two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests for independent samples, followed by adjustment of p-values with false discovery rate (FDR). Group differences were also assessed in the presence of covariates 1) age at diagnosis, 2) sex, 3) participant\u2019s age, 4) presence\/absence of MTS, and 5) Normalized Ipsilateral\/contralateral hippocampal volumes ( ). \n\nA network-based approach was conducted using the Network-Based statistic (NBS) toolbox [ ] on MATLAB v.2018a. Similarly to the cluster correction in voxelwise analyses, NBS focuses on the computation of cluster statistics rather than on independent node statistics, and thus, it yields a higher sensitivity and statistical power at the cost of reducing the specificity of statistical comparisons. To conduct NBS analysis, first, an initial cluster threshold value is chosen to identify significant connections between pairs of nodes. Next, connections that surpass such thresholds are used to reveal the distinct components of the network. Lastly, statistical comparisons between samples are carried out, and a p-value is assigned to the components through a permutation test. In this study, we tested between-groups hypotheses bidirectionally (Controls > Patients; Controls < Patients) with an initial threshold set at t-test > 2.1 and subsequent permutations test set at n = 5000. In both the network-based and the node-based approaches, results were deemed significant at a p-value < 0.05. \n\n\n### Association between resting-state functional connectivity and neuropsychological scores \n  \nWe aimed to examine whether FC of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and TPN correlated with performance in various cognitive domains in both the whole sample and groups. Accordingly, to explore global associations, we fitted simple linear regressions (GLM) to predict each cognitive score from FC of node pairs (  CS = \u03b2   + \u03b2   FC   + \u03b2   Group + \u03b5rror)  , and to explore group-specific associations we fitted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models predicting each cognitive score as an interaction between FC of node pairs and group (  CS = \u03b2   + \u03b2   FC   + \u03b2   Group + \u03b2   FC   *Group + \u03b5rror)  . When reporting results of GLM and ANCOVA analyses, we focused the significance of the   \u03b2   FC   and   \u03b2   FC   *Group   terms respectively. Since we built an independent model for each functional connection, we controlled for false positives by calculating an adjusted p-value threshold using Bonferroni\u2019s method (\u03b1\/n, with \u03b1 = 0.05 and n = 9 cognitive indexes, resulting in p  < 0.0055. Additionally we evaluated the same GLM\/ANCOVA models adjusting for covariates: 1) age at seizure onset, 2) sex, 3) participant\u2019s age, 4) presence\/absence of MTS, and 5) normalized Ipsilateral\/contralateral hippocampal volumes (see  ). \n\n\n### General linear model of fMRI during Sternberg\u2019s memory task \n  \nThe analyzed sub-sample consisted of 62 subjects, from which 33 were controls (26 women) and 29 were TLE patients. Images were preprocessed with fMRIprep v.1.5.5 [ ]. The preprocessing pipeline for task-fMRI sequences was similar to the RS-fMRI pipeline except that we applied high-pass filtering instead of bandpass filtering, and volume censoring and nuisance regression steps were not carried out during preprocessing, and instead a matrix of nuisance regressors (as described in fmriprep documentation) was calculated and stored for its later use first-level analyses. As for the RS-FC analysis, right-TLE images were swapped on the x-axis. To evaluate the WMem network we used the FEAT tool in FSL (version 6.00, FSL tools, FMRIB, Oxford) [ ], and carried out a general linear model (GLM) for a block design on each subject\u2019s image series. First-level analyses were carried out by modeling the BOLD signal time series as a linear combination of six main regressors: one regressor for each of the three stages of the task (encoding, retention, retrieval) and one for each of the three levels of difficulty (recalling of 2, 4, or 6 digits), convolved with a gamma hemodynamic response function. Additionally, we generated regressors of no interest (covariates) for: trials in which participants answered incorrectly, rigid motion parameters and the top 10 aCompcor regressors obtained during preprocessing. First-level contrast parameter estimates (Copes) were used for higher level analyses to investigate fMRI activation at the group-level during WMem processes. Only the retention phase of the WMem paradigm was analyzed, since it is difficult to dissociate attention from motion initiation processes secondary to encoding and retrieval phases, respectively. Single-group average fMRI activation was assessed through a mixed effects (FLAME 1) model. Correction for multiple comparisons was carried out through random field theory (cluster forming threshold: z>3.1), and regions were deemed significant if p  < 0.05. \n\n\n### Association between BOLD activity during retention phase and cognitive abilities \n  \nFrom identified clusters involved in the retention phase, we generated spherical regions of interest (ROI; 4mm radius) centered at the local maxima ( ). Considering previous reports of TLE patients displaying aberrant hippocampal activity during working memory [ ,  ,  ], we also included two spherical hippocampal ROIs derived from the DMN-TPN networks resulting from RS analyses. Mean BOLD percentage change during the retention phase relative to basal activity was obtained per ROI and was analyzed and compared between groups through Student\u2019s t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Additionally, we examined whether such BOLD activity was correlated with neuropsychological performance by fitting GLM or ANCOVA models as described above for FC analysis. Each cognitive score was predicted as a function of BOLD activity in GLMs and as an interaction between BOLD activity and group in ANCOVA per ROI, with statistical significance considered at p  <0.05. \n\nFinally, we explored whether regions involved in the retention phase of Sternberg\u2019s memory task were functionally altered during rest. For this purpose each ROI was used to generate a whole-brain FC map through computation of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of the ROI\u2019s time series and the time series of every other voxel. FMRIB-FSL Randomize (version v.2.9) was used with 5000 permutations to determine p-value followed by threshold-free cluster enhancement to detect significant clusters. \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nAll data, including raw MRI images (T1-weighted, resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI), and cognitive scores, are freely-available at Openneuro (data set ds004469,  ). Additionally, code for statistical models and interactive visualizations of voxelwise results are at  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neuropsychological tests \n  \nAnalysis of cognitive indices derived from WAIS-IV and WMS-IV batteries showed that control subjects obtained average scores according to the population norm. In contrast, scores of TLE patients reflected mild to moderate cognitive impairment, with significantly lower scores in all the cognitive domains as compared with healthy subjects ( ). After Bonferroni correction, all differences remained significant with the exception of VWMI. Scores of TLE patients were lowest in indexes related to memory recall and\/or retention of information. As sample sizes varied slightly between imaging analyses, we explored the cognitive profiles in each sub-sample of participants, showing similar between-group differences ( ). \n   Cognitive indexes.  \nResults are represented by group means. Significantly different indexes between groups are labeled with an asterisk (*) for Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05. Nearly identical results are observed when analyzing the sub-groups used for each of the imaging analyses ( ). \n  \n\n### Network analysis \n  \nAnalysis carried out with NBS revealed the presence of three components (sub-networks) that were significantly different between healthy participants and TLE patients. As shown in  , Component 1 corresponds to a sub-network of the DMN which included both hippocampi, both middle temporal gyri, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Compared to healthy participants, TLE patients displayed a decrease of FC in this component. Similarly, TLE patients also showed a decrease in FC in Component 2 ( ), a sub-network of TPN, that involves nodes from the salience network (anterior insular cortices and paracingulate gyrus) and the contralateral supramarginal gyrus. On the other hand, while the control group showed the typical anticorrelation between DMN and TPN, patients with TLE did not show such divergent activity amongst these two networks, involving structures also seen in Component 1, such as the ipsilateral hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. In addition to the NBS approach, we searched for alterations in FC at individual connections through t-tests between groups ( ). After FDR correction, C.HIPP-I.HIPP and PCG-I.INS were significantly lower in TLE patients (p  < 5\u00d710  for both). \n   Functional connectivity differences between controls and TLE patients.  \nA): Adjacency matrix showing between-group pairwise connectivity differences. Full-colored cells depict group differences at an uncorrected p-value<0.05, while diamond-filled cells indicate significance after FDR correction. color-coded is used to depict the three components identified with NBS analysis (default-mode network: DMN; task-positive networks: TPN; and their interaction: DMN-TPN. Their corresponding spatial configuration is shown in B. C-E: Boxplots show group-wise values at the edge level for each component. Diamonds in A, and C-E represent significant between-group differences in pairwise node-node comparisons (FDR p <0.05). Refer to   for ROI abbreviations. Brain slices and surfaces in this and Figs  \u2013  correspond to the MNI 152 atlas. \n  \nWe repeated this analysis using clinical information as covariates, including age at seizure onset, sex, and hippocampal volume. Overall, edge-wise results were similar at the uncorrected p value ( ), Notably, nine edges consistently showed between-group differences in all the explored models, involving both hippocampi, middle temporal gyri, and contralateral insula and supramarginal gyrus. However, these models did not show statistically-significant differences after correction with FDR and NBS. \n\n\n### Associations between functional connectivity and cognitive scores \n  \n shows significant associations between FC edges and cognitive scores after correction for multiple comparisons. As depicted in panel A, cognitive scores were significantly predicted from FC of edge pairs regardless of subject\u2019s groups. Roughly, we observed that intra-network connectivity was positively correlated with cognitive performance while inter-network connectivity (DMN-TPN anticorrelations) was negatively correlated with cognitive performance (See also  ). Interestingly, most of the node pairs involved in such associations, also differed between groups at the network level as shown in  . \n   Functional connectivity and cognitive scores.  \nA) Significant associations between FC and cognitive scores in all participants (GLM) and B) associations between FC and cognitive scores with significant group interaction (ANCOVA). In the matrices, colored cells depict significant F-test values (p < 0.05). Scatter plots on the right side are shown to illustrate the linear relationships or group interactions between node-node pairs and cognitive scores (all scatter plots are available in  ). Functional connectivity is expressed as Fisher\u2019s z. Pearson coefficients and p-values are shown color-coded for significant group-specific correlations. At the bottom, spatial representations of significant associations are depicted. Light-red colored spheres represent DMN nodes and blue colored spheres represent TPN nodes. Size of spheres (nodes) is proportional to the frequency of involvement of a given node in any significant association. The thickness of sticks (edges) is proportional to the frequency of involvement of a given node-node pair in any significant association. Results for GLM and ANCOVA models adjusted for clinical information are shown in  . \n  \nWe also sought for group-specific associations through ANCOVA models. TLE patients showed several significant correlations between FC and cognitive scores, while healthy subjects did not. These associations involved both hippocampi, middle temporal lobe regions, insular cortices, and Ipsilateral precentral gyrus (Figs   and  ). \n\n\n### Sternberg\u2019s memory task \n  \n#### Behavioral paradigm \n  \nControl group and TLE patients did not differ in the number of correct responses (F(1,67) = 2.23, p = 0.139). Across both groups, the number of correct responses during Sternberg\u2019s task correlated with working memory index (r = 0.47, p = 0.0008). A significant effect of cognitive load (number of digits retained in memory) was found (F(2,134) = 7.991, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected tests revealed that both groups performed significantly better when they had to memorize 2 vs 6 digits (t(32) = 2.97, p < 0.05; t(35) = 3.01, p < 0.05). In addition, the control group also performed significantly better when they had to memorize 2 vs 4 digits (t(32) = 2.97, p < 0.05). No interaction between group\u00d7digits was found (F(2,134) = 0.744, p = 0.47). We analyzed the mean reaction time of subjects along correct response trials. Mixed-effects ANOVA revealed significant effects of group (F(1,47) = 6.44, p < 0.05) and cognitive load (F(2,94) = 17.102, p < 0.0001) but no significant interaction between these factors (F(2,94) = 2.942, p = 0.058). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that in comparison to controls, TLE patients had significantly greater reaction times when they had to memorize either 2 digits (t(47) = -3.39, p < 0.01) or 4 digits (t(47) = -2.09, p < 0.05). Additionally, post-hoc tests revealed that only control subjects significantly increased their reaction time in the 4 (t(20) = -4.37, p < 0.001) and 6 digits (t(20) = -5.77, p < 0001) conditions in comparison with the 2 digits condition.   illustrates these differences. \n   Sternberg\u2019s working memory task.  \nA) Correct answers and reaction time (mean and standard error) as a function of memory load and its correlation with WMI derived from cognitive batteries.

Asterisks indicate p  < 0.05. \n  \n\n#### Functional correlates of Sternberg memory task \n  \nWe fitted a GLM to find the significant brain regions involved in the retention phase of the WMem task. In both groups, we observed bilateral activation of frontal poles, supramarginal gyri, anterior insular cortices and middle frontal gyri ( ). Furthermore we detected activation in the Ipsilateral (left) precentral gyrus, and the Juxtapositional Lobule cortex\/Paracingulate gyrus. When comparing between-group activity, planned contrasts revealed that TLE patients had less BOLD activity than controls in ipsilateral precentral gyrus. Contrarily, contralateral frontal operculum had significantly greater activity in TLE patients. In all cases, controls display greater BOLD signal change as compared to TLE patients. \n\n\n#### Association between BOLD activity during retention phase and cognitive scores \n  \nVoxelwise analyses revealed that the correlation between cognitive indexes and BOLD activity within supramarginal gyri, intraparietal sulci, ipsilateral precentral gyrus and contralateral occipital cortex significantly differed between groups.   illustrates correlations between mean BOLD percentage change during Sternberg\u2019s task and cognitive indexes that differed between patients and controls.

Color bars in A and B indicate the number of cognitive indexes that show significant correlations.

Bottom row shows group-wise differences of the corresponding connectivity maps. \n  \n\n#### Alterations in RS-FC in retention phase (ROI-analysis) \n  \nFinally, we hypothesized that TLE patients would display alterations of RSFC related to regions involved in the retention phase of Sternberg\u2019s memory task. To this end, we used seed-based connectivity analyses (SCA) and evaluated the correlation of the BOLD signal between the seed region and the rest of the brain. Brain areas found to be active in the retention phase of the WMem task ( ) and both hippocampi served as seed regions. We found significant group-level differences in the connectivity of the following areas: both insular cortices, both hippocampi, ipsilateral frontal pole and ipsilateral supramarginal gyrus. Broadly, we observed that patients had decreased RSFC in salience network (as evidenced by insular SCA) and ipsilateral fronto-parietal network (as evidenced by ipsilateral supramarginal and ipsilateral frontal pole SCA). Large between-group differences were found in hippocampal SCA. In general, patients displayed decreased RSFC between C.HIPP and I.HIPP and greater RSFC between C.HIPP and Contralateral fronto-parietal network regions. All of these results were consistent and similar to those obtained through the network-based approach, showing abnormal RSFC in TPN, DMN and in anticorrelations between both systems. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCognitive deficits are common in patients with TLE and affect several cognitive domains that involve brain regions within and beyond the temporal lobes. Here, we confirm that, as a group, TLE patients have cognitive deficits across domains, albeit with considerable inter-subject heterogeneity. Through analysis of resting-state fMRI we showed that cognitive deficits are associated with disorganized functional connectivity, with patients showing decreased connectivity within the default-mode and temporo-polar networks and, contrastingly, a less marked decoupling between DMN and TPN than what is typically seen in healthy individuals. Extensive cognitive testing allowed us to identify that the degree of specific region-to-region connectivity is associated with neuropsychometric scores of visual memory, processing speed, and perceptual reasoning. Further testing of working memory within the imaging session showed that alterations of WMem are accompanied by reduced activity of temporo-parietal regions, which are also less tightly connected to remote brain areas. Our work provides evidence that the association between functional connectivity and cognitive scores is modulated by the presence of epilepsy and adds information related to the various forms of cognitive deficits seen in patients with TLE. \n\nIn previous studies with the same sample of participants, it has been observed that cognitive performance is not homogeneous across TLE patients, who show cognitive scores ranging from intact to severe generalized cognitive deficits [ ,  ]. The range and type of cognitive disabilities seen in TLE patients have in turn been associated with specific patterns of morphological alterations [ ] and structural connectivity [ ,  ]. Therefore, it is believed that the distributed gray [ ] and white matter damage [ ] seen in TLE explain the heterogeneity of the type and severity of cognitive deficits in these patients through a disruption of the normal flow of information within the brain. Indeed, abnormalities of functional connectivity have been reported in TLE, providing evidence for abnormalities of network topography [ ,  ] and alterations of the DMN, the attention network, and the reward\/emotion network [ ,  \u2013 ]. Spatial patterns of RSFC abnormalities greatly coincide with structural damage [ ,  ], and appear to be mediated by microstructural abnormalities of white matter [ ]. Normally, brain regions within the TPN increase their activity during cognitive tasks, and are negatively correlated with components of the DMN [ ]. Our results recapitulate the previously observed reduction of functional connectivity within each of the DMN and TPN. Moreover, TLE patients failed to show anticorrelations between DMN and TPN, while healthy participants displayed said typical association ( ) [ ,  ]. In agreement with previous reports, inter-hippocampal connectivity was decreased in TLE patients, as was the interaction between the ipsilateral hippocampus and temporal neocortex [ \u2013 ]. When accounting for demographic and clinical variables, the majority of findings were reproduced with a similar magnitude and direction ( ). A reduction in the effect was observed when adjusting for duration of illness and structural integrity of hippocampi (volume and presence of hippocampal sclerosis). Thus, these variables are an important source of variance that account for the observed FC alterations in TLE patients. This effect was particularly noticeable in edges that involved ipsilateral hippocampus and ipsilateral medial temporal lobe nodes. Interestingly, adjusting for these covariates also revealed alterations in contralateral hippocampus-TPN edges. These alterations, as well as decreases of DMN-TPN anticorrelations may account for the cognitive deficits observed in the TLE group. \n\nWe observed that FC within DMN or TPN edges is positively correlated with cognitive performance, while FC between DMN-TPN edges is rather negatively correlated ( ). In addition, we found several instances where TLE and healthy participants displayed different associations between region-to-region connectivity and cognitive performance ( ). The majority of these between-group differences consisted of significant correlations seen in patients, but not in controls. It is tempting to associate increased functional connectivity with better performance, and there are examples advocating for that view in our results, and in the literature [ ]. Nonetheless, the opposite can be observed in some connectivity edges. In our study we found that visual working memory was poorer in TLE patients with higher degree of connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the contralateral parieto-occipital sulcus. Increased connectivity between these two nodes also had a negative effect on processing speed, an this negative effect was also seen for the increased connectivity between ipsilateral posterior parietal lobule and ipsilateral supramarginal gyrus, and ipsilateral precentral gyrus and ipsilateral frontal pole. The reconfiguration of functional networks suggest compensatory mechanisms at play in patients to maintain cognitive abilities [ ]. Similar modifications of brain networks related to WMem have also been reported in infants with periventricular leukomalacia [ ]. \n\nThere are discrepancies in our results as compared to previous reports. First, we do not see an increase of connectivity of the contralateral mesiotemporal networks, which has been shown to correlate with WMem performance [ ]. Increased functional connectivity between ipsilateral mesial temporal structures and the ipsilateral posterior DMN have been reported to have an association with poorer verbal memory abilities [ ,  ], while increased coupling between the ipsilateral hippocampus and contralateral posterior DMN shows a positive relation with improved verbal memory [ ]. In our study, the connectivity of the ipsilateral hippocampus to other structures (contralateral hippocampus, insula, supramarginal gyrus, and ipsilateral middle temporal, precentral, and supramarginal gyri) was associated with auditory, working, and immediate memory indexes. Notably, delayed memory index was positively associated with the connectivity between both hippocampi. Conversely, increased connectivity between the ipsilateral hippocampus and ipsilateral precentral gyrus negatively correlated with auditory, working and immediate memory indexes, as well as verbal comprehension index. The contralateral left mesial temporal lobe and the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex has previously been shown to be positively associated with higher scores for non-verbal memory [ ]. In our study, TLE patients (but not control subjects) showed a similar association ( ). While some of the previous studies studied left and right TLE patients separately, we pooled both patient groups and studied their brains according to ipsi- or contralateral to seizure onset. This, added to the known functional brain asymmetries behind many cognitive abilities (e.g., verbal) likely accounts for the differences between studies. \n\nDespite having clear deficiencies in working memory when evaluated outside the scanner ( ), TLE patients in our study showed only a tendency for reduced correct answers during Sternberg\u2019s task in the MRI scanner, but there was a clear difference between the two groups in their reaction times, with patients responding much later than controls, even in trials with minimal cognitive load ( ). Correspondingly, the large majority of brain regions that form the normal fronto-parietal network involved in WMem [ ] showed less activation in TLE patients than healthy participants, replicating and extending previous findings [ ]. Moreover, the level of activation of fronto-parietal regions involved in WMem showed differential correlations with other immediate and delayed memory indices, with positive correlations seen in TLE patients, but not in healthy participants ( ), suggesting compensatory mechanisms to maintain WMem. Finally, seed-based analyses of resting-state BOLD co-activation showed larger connectivity between the hippocampi and fronto-parietal regions in TLE patients, as compared to controls ( ). This result is in line with the increased co-activation of these same regions seen during an N-back WMem task [ ]. In said report, as in ours, increased co-activation of these brain regions was associated with poor WMem performance. Our work extends said observations by showing that TLE patients have decreased connectivity between ipsilateral insula and frontal regions, and between ipsilateral frontal pole and supramarginal gyrus. Thus, our results show the WMem network of TLE patients is altered at rest, is suboptimally engaged during memory retention, and is differentially modulated to subserve immediate and delayed memory performance. \n\nThere are some limitations in our study. First, we could not obtain histological confirmation of hippocampal sclerosis as the patients studied, unfortunately, did not undergo surgical treatment. Despite best efforts from the medical community, there are reduced opportunities for surgical treatment of TLE in low- and middle-income countries [ ]. Also, in an effort to boost statistical power, we congregated TLE patients regardless of the hemisphere of seizure onset, and analyzed their data according to ipsilateral or contralateral to the epileptogenic temporal lobe. This strategy makes it difficult to adequately interpret results related to cognitive or functional hemispheric specialization, such as verbal skills in our resting-state connectivity analyses. On the other hand, findings regarding the bilateral and symmetrical network involved in WMem are likely less affected by this limitation. \n\nIn conclusion, our results allowed us to link whole-brain connectivity with cognitive scores in multiple domains, showing abnormal patterns in TLE patients that tie together with cognitive deficits, as well as putative compensatory mechanisms. Targeting one specific cognitive feature, namely WMem, we were able to identify abnormalities in the activity of the underlying brain regions in TLE, but also how these associate to other brain regions and networks and affect several other cognitive abilities. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10936866,"text_md5":"b459ff4256f6243cbfbd4e7cb59a6e87","field_positions":{"authors":[0,152],"journal":[153,161],"publication_year":[163,167],"title":[178,318],"keywords":[332,332],"abstract":[345,2177],"body":[2186,44887]},"batch":1,"pmid":38478498,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0295142","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10936866","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10936866"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10936866\">10936866<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10936866  Functional correlates of cognitive performance and working memory in temporal lobe epilepsy: Insights from task-based and resting-state fMRI"}

Inability to do so might contribute to maladaptive behaviors such as drug use, which often takes place in social settings. Here, we examined nicotine-dependent humans using fMRI, as they made choices that could influence the proposals from simulated partners. Computational modeling revealed that smokers under-estimated the influence of their actions and self-reported a reduced sense of control, compared to non-smokers. These findings were replicated in a large independent sample of participants recruited online. Neurally, smokers showed reduced tracking of forward projected choice values in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and impaired computation of social prediction errors in the midbrain. These results demonstrate that smokers were less accurate in estimating their personal influence when the social environment calls for control, providing a neurocomputational account for the social cognitive deficits in this population. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe environment we live in is highly complex and uncertain. As such, one must be able to exert control over the environment to achieve desired outcomes and avoid unwanted ones. For humans, our social environment might present the most challenging situation for exerting behavioral control, due to its high degree of complexity.   Social controllability,   defined as one\u2019s ability to exert control during interpersonal interactions, is thus essential for optimal decision-making in everyday scenarios  . The breakdown of this process might lead to suboptimal behaviors such as substance abuse, which often takes place with other people or under the influence of other people. Smoking and nicotine use, for example, is a highly social behavior, especially in younger adults  . While prior work has examined many constructs related to smoking (e.g. cue reactivity, impulsive control), little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive deficits associated with this population. Specially, it remains elusive how human smokers exert and perceive social control differently from non-smokers at both neural and computational levels. \n\nPreviously, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used to capture how drugs might alter neural computations of decision variables, such as encoding of reward prediction errors by the mesolimbic circuit  . Furthermore, economic preference models such as temporal discounting have also revealed that substance-dependent individuals show a preference for smaller immediate rewards over delayed larger rewards   which may reflect a complex interaction between time perception and risk preference  . More recent computational models have linked addiction to dysfunctions in model-based control   and forward planning  . Others have postulated that these model-based planning deficits are further amplified by complex environments  . However, empirical evidence from substance-dependent humans supporting these computational frameworks \u2013 especially in the context of social decision-making - is still scarce. Here, we aim to directly examine the neural computations underlying social controllability in substance-dependent humans, using a computational psychiatry approach and nicotine addiction as a test case. \n\nBased on the literature reviewed thus far, we hypothesized that smokers would demonstrate reduced ability to exert social control, subserved by reduced neural computations of social forward planning and learning signals. At the neural level, previous work shows that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is important for tracking the downstream effects of agents\u2019 current choices in order to exploit the controllability of a simulated social environment in healthy volunteers  . The vmPFC has been consistently shown to encode cognitive maps, an efficient way to represent task space and environmental structure that are crucial for model-based planning  . Using a similar decision-making task ( ) in smokers and non-smokers across two independent samples (in-person fMRI sample: n = 17 for smokers and n = 25 for non-smokers; online replication sample: n = 72 for smokers and n = 147 for non-smokers; see   and   Tables S1-S2   for participant characteristics), the current study examined how vmPFC-dependent social controllability computation might differ between nicotine-dependent humans and non-using controls. Participants made choices about accepting or rejecting an monetary proposal from stimulated partners (i.e. the ultimatum game;  ); crucially and different from a typical ultimatum game, their choices could increase or decrease the future monetary proposals from the partners in a probabilistic fashion ( ). We used computational modeling (see  ) to quantify a key parameter   (\u201cestimated influence\u201d) representing the mentally simulated influence of one\u2019s actions on future social outcomes  . We predicted that smokers would under-estimate the level of influence their actions have on the future, compared to controls, accompanied by reduced neural activation in the vmPFC. A secondary analysis will also examine neural activations (e.g. midbrain) related to social prediction errors in both groups. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Smokers failed to exploit the controllability of their social interactions \n  \nWe first evaluated model-agnostic measures of subjects\u2019 behaviors to determine if they were able to detect and exploit the controllability of the interactions in this task, indexed by the offer amount they were able to obtain. For non-smokers, we found that they successfully raised the offers over time ( ). In contrast, smokers were unable to exploit the controllability of their interactions as indicated by the flat or even slight decrease in offer sizes over time ( ). On average, smokers received lower offers on average ($4.5 \u00b1 0.52) compared to controls ($5.98 \u00b1 0.39; t(40) = 2.31, p = 0.0131; ). This suggests that overall, smokers failed to exploit the controllability of the interactions. \n\nGiven the contingencies designed in the game, participants would need to reject and forgo smaller offers to strategically raise future offers. Thus, we compared rejection rates between smokers and non-smokers. We found that total rejection rates were not significantly different between smokers (43.23%\u00b15.8) and non-smokers (50.26%\u00b13.0) ( ). However, when offers were grouped into low ($1-$3), medium ($4-$6) and high ($7-$9), smokers\u2019 rejection rates of medium sized offers (46.72%\u00b16.71) were lower than those of non-smokers (66.93%\u00b16.64; t(40) = 2.27, p = 0.0144;  ). This result suggests that smokers did not use \u201cstrategic rejection\u201d as well as non-smokers, which contributed to their inability to raise offers overall. In parallel to their choice behaviors, smokers also reported a lower sense of control (52.40%\u00b15.04) compared to non-smokers (50.26%\u00b13.0; t(40) = 1.93, p = 0.031;  ). Taken together, these model-agnostic behavioral results reveal that nicotine-smokers failed to exploit the controllability of the social environment. \n\n\n### Smokers under-estimated the future influence of their current choices \n  \nNext, we sought to uncover the computational mechanisms underlying subjects\u2019 choices using a series of models involving various depths of future steps computations (1 to 4), not involving future thinking (but still considered aversion to norm violation), or only using cached value in a model-free fashion without forward thinking or norm violation. Model comparison results demonstrated that in the controllable condition, all the FT models better explained both smokers\u2019 and non-smokers\u2019 choices compared to the 0-step model or model-free reinforcement learning model (  Table S3  ). Consistent with our previous work, the 2-step FT model also showed good parameter recoverability (  Table S4-S5  ) and was selected for subsequent statistical and neural analyses. Overall, the 2-step FT model predicted non-smokers\u2019 choices with an 86.21% accuracy ( ) and smokers\u2019 choices with an 86.47% accuracy ( ). \n\nNext, we examined parameters from the 2-step model (see   for all parameter values). Our key parameter of interest here is  , which represents the mentally estimated controllability or influence of one\u2019s current choices on future offers. We found a significant difference in this parameter between smokers (0.352 \u00b1 1.54) and non-smokers (1.40 \u00b1 0.654; t(40)= \u22123.02, p = 0.002;  ). This result suggests that while engaging a 2-step forward-thinking model, smokers significantly under-estimated how much their current choices might affect future interactions compared to non-smokers. Interestingly, no other parameters showed a significant difference between groups. These findings suggest that a lower   \u2013 or reduced estimate of influence of one\u2019s actions on the environment \u2013 explains the model-agnostic finding of smokers receiving a lower level of offer overall. \n\n\n### Replication of behavioral and computational results in the online sample \n  \nNext, we analyzed data collected from our large online sample to examine if the behavioral and computational findings from the in-person study were generalizable to a group of smokers with less severe nicotine dependence (  Table S2  ). In line with findings from the in-person sample, smokers recruited online also had reduced offer sizes over time compared to non-smokers, although their offer trajectory showed a slight upward trend ( ). On average, smokers still had significantly lower mean offer size (5.53 \u00b1 1.85) compared to non-smokers (6.06 \u00b1 1.68; bootstrapping p = 0.0266;  ), albeit a smaller group difference. These results demonstrated that smokers recruited online were also less successful than non-smokers in exploiting the controllability of the social environment. \n\nConsistent with our in-person sample, we found that total rejection rates did not differ significantly between smokers (51.57%\u00b10.12) and non-smokers (53.97%\u00b10.10) (p = 0.0770;  ). When we analyzed rejection rates based on offer size (low: $1-$3, medium: $4-$6, and high: $7-$9), we replicated the previously observed pattern of lower rejection rates among smokers for medium offers (smokers: 57.59%\u00b10.29, non-smokers: 66.40 \u00b1 0.27; p = 0.0175;  ). Online smokers also self-reported a reduced sense of control (smokers: 52.68%\u00b134.46, non-smokers: 61.32%\u00b134.63; p = 0.0442;  ), similar to what we observed in the in-person sample. \n\nFinally, we applied the same computational models to fit the choice data collected from online participants. Overall, model-based results were also consistent between the in-person and online sample. Specifically, we found that the estimated influence parameter from the 2-step model was significantly reduced in smokers (1.12 \u00b1 1.02) compared to non-smokers (1.35 \u00b1 0.83; p-value = 0.0447;  ). Collectively, the larger online sample replicated key behavioral and computational findings from the in-person study, further confirming aberrant forward-thinking in smokers across a wide range of severity. \n\n\n### Smokers showed aberrant encoding of forward thinking value in the vmPFC \n  \nFor the neural analyses, our primary interest was to examine neural activities associated with the FT value signal during forward thinking, which was found to be encoded by the vmPFC in healthy volunteers  . Thus, we first conducted ROI analysis using beta coefficients extracted from an independent ROI of the vmPFC [\u22122, 50, \u22122]   ( ). This analysis revealed that vmPFC activations related to total choice value were significantly greater for non-smokers (parameter estimate: 0.347 \u00b1 0.211) compared to smokers (parameter estimate: \u22120.749 \u00b10.486; two-sample t(40) = \u22122.31, p = 0.013;  ). Whole-brain analysis ( ) further confirmed that even after whole-brain correction, BOLD responses in the vmPFC were still significantly greater for non-smokers compared to smokers (P <0.05, k > 50). Overall, these results indicate aberrant neural encoding for the computation of FT values in the vmPFC in smokers. \n\n\n### Reduced activation to norm prediction errors in the midbrain in smokers compared to non-smokers \n  \nWe additionally evaluated nPE encoding, given that smokers have previously demonstrated altered learning   and that nPEs were an important learning signal driving norm updating in this game. Based on previous research   demonstrating the involvement of mesolimbic structures (e.g. midbrain) in reward-based learning, we extracted neural signals tracking nPE using an independent ROI of midbrain [4, \u221226, \u221211] ( ) that included regions of the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra  . We found that while nPEs positively scaled with midbrain activity in non-smokers (parameter estimate: 0.302 \u00b1 0.220), this relationship was inversed in smokers (parameter estimate: \u22120.306 \u00b1 0.252; two-sample t(40)= \u22121.80, p = 0.040;  ). Whole brain analysis further confirmed this significant group difference in that smokers showed reduced activation than non-smokers in midbrain activity related to nPEs ( ;   and  ). Collectively, these results are consistent with previous findings indicating prediction error encoding deficits in smokers and expand beyond previous findings by showing how nicotine addiction is also associated to aberrant updating of information in the context of dynamic social interactions  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSocial controllability, the ability to exert control during social interactions, is crucial for behavioral adaptability. Previous research suggests that accurately simulating the impact of one\u2019s actions on future states is crucial for exerting social control, a process subserved by a vmPFC circuit  . Here, we demonstrated how neural computation of social control might be altered in nicotine addiction. Our main finding demonstrated that, in a controllable social environment, smokers under-estimated the downstream influence of their current choices and thus, failed to exploit the controllability of their social interactions. These findings were consistent in a larger online sample, further confirming the observed effect among smokers. Neurally, smokers showed reduced encoding of forward-thinking values in the vmPFC and reduced tracking of norm prediction errors in the midbrain. Collectively, these results suggest that social cognitive deficits in addiction might be associated with complex decision processes involving future-oriented thinking. \n\nPrevious work has often focused on how individuals with SUDs exert control over motor impulses or over actions with immediate outcomes. These studies have demonstrated reduced cognitive control and high impulsivity levels in these individuals  . Based on this literature, one might expect that smokers would exhibit reduced planning horizon as suggested by previous computational work  . Here, formal model comparison showed that smokers engaged a similar 2-step forward thinking model as non-smoking controls, yet under-estimated the influence of their actions on future states (lower   value) compared to non-smokers. This interpretation is consistent with the participants\u2019 subjective assessment of controllability in the game, where smokers indicated they perceived future offers as being less affected by their actions, compared to matching controls. These findings echo with the idea that it is maladaptive for an agent to infer that they have less impact on the future than they actually do, as one might not only miss out exploitable opportunities but also fail to avoid negative consequences in the future  . Although no punishment was introduced as outcome in our study design, our work provides a computational framework and paradigm that could be used by future research to examine mental simulation of future negative consequences. It also remains to be investigated whether the findings of smokers\u2019 under-estimation of their influence is associated with a mismatch between available cognitive resources and environmental complexity  . \n\nOur finding is also in line with and provides a computational explanation for findings of increased discounting rates of future rewards associated with SUD   and that simulation of future events reduces delay discounting and cigarette consumption  . Importantly, our study expands this literature by showing that future-oriented valuation of one\u2019s own agency (i.e. calculating the impact of one\u2019s action on future events) is altered in smokers and might become a key factor in their altered estimation of future values, contributing to the temporal discounting effect. This could introduce new avenues for intervention, as an accurate mental representation of how current actions impact downstream outcomes may help individuals with SUD reevaluate drug-related choices. \n\nThe cognitive deficit in forward thinking observed in smokers was corroborated by our neural finding of reduced activity in the vmPFC in tracking projected total choice value in this group. The vmPFC has been heavily implicated in both addiction   and value-based decision-making  . Specifically, decreased activity of the vmPFC has been associated with a reduced preference for delayed rewards and impairments in valuation processes  . In both occasional and nicotine-dependent smokers, activity in the mPFC is associated with decisions to purchase or consume cigarettes  . Here, we observed that vmPFC activity was in fact anticorrelated with projected total values in smokers, deviating from the positive association between the two measures observed in non-smokers. This finding, along with past research, demonstrates that deficit in the vmPFC is associated with suboptimal decision-making in nicotine addiction. Our result also expands beyond previous work by demonstrating that aberrant neural activity in the vmPFC is detrimental to not only value representation but also future-oriented, model-based planning. This finding is consistent with more recent work highlighting the role of vmPFC in presenting states and task structure  . \n\nWe also found aberrant neural tracking of norm prediction errors in the midbrain in smokers. Norm prediction errors, defined as the difference between the actual social signal (i.e. proposed offer) and one\u2019s expectation (i.e. internal norms), allows an agent to flexibly adapt to a changing social environment. Previously, activities in midbrain structures \u2013 including the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area-have been linked to social norm updating and decision-making during the ultimatum game  . Existing work has also indicated altered non-social reward prediction error encoding in individuals with addiction  . Hence, we extend both lines of previous work by demonstrating that addiction is also linked to neural deficits in the midbrain during aberrant norm updating in complex social environments. \n\nFinally, despite the acknowledgment of the importance of social factors in addiction   and findings from this work, very little empirical evidence exists that explain how social cognition is impacted in nicotine dependent subjects at either the neural or the computational level. In one study, Chung and colleagues used a peer influence paradigm and fMRI   in adolescents; they found that substance na\u00efve teens showed enhanced vmPFC activations towards safe choices made by peers, compared to teens who had used substances  . This result suggests that substance use might be associated with reduced ability to distinguish benevolent vs. malevolent social signals. Our work is consistent with this study and expands our knowledge about the social brain in addition in demonstrating that substance use can be associated with both reduced ability to encode social value signals, and impairment in learning from social signals or using them to exert control during interpersonal interactions. \n\nLimitations of the current study include a small sample size and low representation of females (due to higher tobacco use in males) of the fMRI study. Although the male-to-female ratio was less biased in the online sample (43% females), it is important to note that sex imbalances are often observed in the general population  . As such, further larger-scale studies are needed to address the potential sex differences in nicotine addiction-related neural mechanisms and to provide more conclusive insights. Furthermore, although we were able to demonstrate group differences between smokers and controls, we did not find meaningful association between task behaviors and clinical measures capturing subjects\u2019 severity of tobacco use or craving. Futures studies may investigate the relationship between deprivation level and task-based measures by systematically manipulating participants\u2019 abstinence. \n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that under-estimation of the future consequences of their choices may be a key feature of nicotine-dependent humans and contribute to their inability to exert control in social settings. This serves as a plausible neurocomputational account for the social cognitive deficits observed in this population. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### In-person study: \n  \nThe fMRI study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of the Texas Southwestern Medical Center (where SN, MH, VFG, and XG worked and collected this dataset). All participants were recruited from the Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan area through advertisements and flyers. All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study and were compensated for their time. The criteria for in-person smoker recruitment included participants who smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily for at least a year and were fluent in English. All candidate participants underwent Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) \u2013 substance use disorder (SUD) module. For all participants, the exclusioncriteria were any major medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions; any incompatibility with MRI safety (e.g. metal implants); and dependence on substances other than nicotine and alcohol (smokers) or any substance dependance (non-smokers). In the final sample, smokers had a mean daily consumption of 18 cigarettes, and mean baseline carbon monoxide (CO) level of 15.59 (SD: 8.89) parts per million (ppm). A total of 25 non-smoking and 17 nicotine-smoking participants were included in the final fMRI sample (  Table S1  ). \n\n\n#### Online study: \n  \nThe online study was approved by the IRB of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We recruited U.S.-based participants from the online subject pool Prolific ( ). Here, we included a wider range of smokers (smoked at least one cigarette per week) to examine if findings from the in-person sample whose nicotine addiction was severe might generalize to a more representative sample of smokers with a wider range of nicotine dependence levels. Smokers with self-reported medical or psychiatric diagnosis were excluded. The final online smoker sample (n = 72) had a mean daily tobacco consumption of 9.34 and had a mean craving score of 64.51 out of 100. All participants provided online consent before participating in the study and were compensated for their time. The criteria for online non-smokers included zero tobacco consumption, no cravings for tobacco in the past week, and no major medical or psychiatric diagnosis. A total of 147 online participants met these criteria for non-smokers and were matched with online smokers for sex, age, education, and handedness (  Table S2  ). \n\n\n\n### Study Procedure \n  \nFor the in-person study, all candidate participants underwent Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) \u2013 substance use disorder module, which was used to determine if they had nicotine addiction and\/or other comorbid substance use disorder. For smokers, we also measured their exhaled CO levels using a smokerylzer (Covita Smokerlyzer) and administered a battery of questionnaires on their demographics and smoking habits. Specifically, the Shiffman-Jarvik Withdrawal Scale   was used to assess participants\u2019 craving and withdrawal symptoms. Non-smokers completed a survey of their demographics. Participants were then asked to withdraw from smoking 12 hours prior to the next scheduled visit. \n\nOn the day of scanning, CO levels were re-evaluated. Participants played a two-party exchange task in a Phillips 3T MRI. A Phillips 3T MRI scanner was used to obtain anatomical and functional images of participants completing the task. High-resolution structural images were collected using a multi-echo MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR\/TE\/TI = 2300\/2.74\/900 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, FOV = 256x256 mm, Slab thickness = 176, Voxel size = 1x1x1 mm, Number of echos = 4, Pixel bandwidth = 650 Hz, Total scan time = 6 min. These structural scans were used for alignmemnt of images. fMRI scans were obtained by setting repetition time (TR) to 2000 ms, echo time (TE) to 25ms, voxel size to 3.4 mm \u00d7 3.4 mm \u00d7 4.0 mm, flip angle to 90\u00b0, and slice number to 37. \n\nFor the online study, after participants consented for research, they completed a battery of surveys that assessed demographics, mental health, and substance use as well as the social controllability task, as described below. \n\n\n### Social Controllability Task \n  \nAll participants completed a two-party exchange task   adapted from the ultimatum game in which simulated partners proposed how to divide a sum of $20 and participants decided whether to accept or reject the offer. If the participant accepted the offer, both the responder (participant) and the proposer received the proposed amount as is. If the participant rejected the offer, neither party received a reward. Offers were always disadvantageous to the participant\/responder (<=$9) and the initial offer was always $5 (\u201cindifference point\u201d). \n\nImportantly, we modified the game so that participants could influence their partner's future monetary proposal using their current actions   ( ). Specifically, if participants rejected the current offer, the next offer would increase by $0, $1 or $2 with a 1\/3 probability for each option; and if they accepted the current offer, the next one would decrease by $0, $1 or $2 with a 1\/3 probability for each ( ). We also included a typical ultimatum game block in which the offer was randomly drawn from normal distribution with a mean of $5 and subjects\u2019 current choice to accept or reject the offer had no influence over the future offers (\u201cuncontrollable\u201d condition; see   Supplementary Material Figure S1   ). \n\nSubjects were told that they were playing with members of two different teams and were not given information regarding how the two teams might differ. The order of the conditions was counterbalanced. The original task with healthy controls included 40 trials per condition and smokers played a slightly shorter version of 30 trials that were shown to generate similar results  . Nevertheless, to match the task length between smokers and non-smokers, only the first 30 trials from healthy control data were included in the analyses. After completing the task, subjects were asked to rate their perceived influence over their partners\u2019 offers in each condition using a scale from 0 to 100 (\u201cperceived controllability). \n\n\n### Computational Modeling of Choice Behavior \n  \nThe   forward thinking (FT) value,   or mentally projected total value of an action taken at the   trial,  , ( )is estimated in an n-step forward thinking model, which considers various planning horizons given hypothetical future actions. Here the FT value   takes into account both current and future utilities of a choice. \n\nC  urrent utility   is a function of reward   and internal norm   at the   trial, defined as follows:\n \n\nThe degree of aversion or sensitivity to norm violation at the individual level is captured by  . Internal norm   is a measure of subjective norm, or one\u2019s trial-by-trial expectation of the offer. Here, we assumed that participants update their internal representation of the norm from trial to trial using the Rescorla-Wagner learning model based on our previous work   and that the initial norm   varies from individual to individual with a range of [$0, $20]  . \n\nHere the learning rate   represents how fast one updates expectation of the offer based on the   norm prediction error   (nPE), defined as  . \n\n Future utility   is described as the summed utility of the mentally simulated future actions   discounted by  , the temporal discounting factor. Similar to our previous work, we fixed   at 0.8, the mean value measured in a larger cohort to control for collinearity with our parameter of interest  .   is the subject\u2019s mentally simulated future split. Importantly, our parameter of interest   represents how much (in dollar amount) a participant thought their action changed the partner\u2019s proposed split at a future trial,  , in the following manner:\n \n\nCritically,   represents a subject\u2019s mentally   estimated influence   of their current action on the subsequent offer (in dollar amount, ranging from  ). The simulated future action   of accepting an offer is determined by the subjective utility of the following rewards  . In the event that the simulated chosen action is to accept the offer  , the hypothetical next offer   decreases by the   estimated influence   parameter  . In the event that the simulated chosen action is to reject the offer   the hypothetical next offer   increases by  . Here   is applied symmetrically to acceptance and rejection, also similar to our previous work  . \n\nAction selection was based on the difference between the total projected value of accepting an offer ( ) and the total projected value of rejecting an offer ( ).\n  in turn influences the probability of choosing an action in a softmax function:\n \n\nBehavioral responses were fitted into five models, each incorporating different planning horizons: 0-step, 1-step, 2-step, 3-step, 4-step. The 0-step model represents a standalone norm learning model and excludes any forward thinking. The other four models assume that an agent simulates the value of an action by considering both current and future values, all based upon the estimated levels of controllability of the social environment. We additionally fitted a model-free reinforcement learning model which only considers cached values (see   Supplemental Information   (S2) for details). The best fitting model was chosen based on both Deviation Information Criteria (DIC) (where a smaller index indicates both higher model evidence and lower model complexity; see   Table S3  ) and the recoverability of model parameters (see   Table S4-S5  ). \n\nIndividual choices from middle trials (trials 6\u201325) were used for model fitting. The first 5 trials were excluded from all participants\u2019 data to allow behavior to stabilize after participants explored the contingencies of the task in these initial trials. The last 5 trials from the smokers\u2019 responses were also excluded given that there was less incentive to reject offers closer to the end of the game  . Finally, the last 15 trials from the non-smokers\u2019 responses were excluded in order to maintain trial number consistent to that of the smokers during analysis. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe functional scans were analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software package (SPM12, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience;  ). First, we preprocessed the images by implementing time correction, co-registration, and normalization with resampled voxel size of 2mm \u00d7 2mm \u00d7 2mm and smoothing with an 8mm Gaussian kernel. After preprocessing, two general linear models (GLMs) were constructed using SPM12 to examine the neural correlates of 1) forward thinking value and 2) norm prediction errors (PEs). The following event regressors were included: 1) offer onset, 2) choice submission, 3) outcome onset, and 4) perceived controllability rating. \n\nImportantly, we specified a parametric modulator of FT value, the forward projected choice value from the 2-step model, normalized at the individual level, at the onset of choice submission. A separate GLM was conducted in which the learning signal nPE replaced the total choice values as the parametric regressor. In both GLMs, six motion parameters were included as covariates. Following individual model estimation at the 1st (subject) level, contrast images representing either total choice value or norm PE were entered into an ANOVA test to compare neural differences between smokers and non-smokers (  and  ). \n\nWe used the MarsBar toolbox   to conduct region of interest (ROI) analyses. Beta values representing choice value-related activations were extracted from an 8-mm radius sphere of the vmPFC using coordinates [\u22122, 50, \u22122] from an independent study  . Beta values representing norm PE were extracted at a coordinate of the midbrain [\u22124, \u221226, \u221211] on an 8-mm radius sphere, from an independent study  . \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10854308,"text_md5":"8f936d155ad44dbf9eff7cc671309393","field_positions":{"authors":[0,105],"journal":[106,112],"publication_year":[114,118],"title":[129,211],"keywords":[225,352],"abstract":[365,1446],"body":[1455,33396]},"batch":1,"pmid":38343814,"doi":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-3854519\/v1","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10854308","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10854308"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10854308\">10854308<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10854308  Aberrant neural computation of social controllability in nicotine-dependent humans"}

Here, electrocorticography (ECoG) measures were used to predict functional MRI changes in the sensorimotor cortex in two brain states: at rest and during motor performance. The specificity of this relationship to spatial co-localisation of the two signals was also investigated. We acquired simultaneous ECoG-fMRI in the sensorimotor cortex of three patients with epilepsy. During motor activity, high gamma power was the only frequency band where the electrophysiological response was co-localised with fMRI measures across all subjects. The best model of fMRI changes across states was its principal components, a parsimonious description of the entire ECoG spectrogram. This model performed much better than any others that were based either on the classical frequency bands or on summary measures of cross-spectral changes. The region-specific fMRI signal is reflected in spatially and spectrally distributed EEG activity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as the pre-eminent neuroimaging modality for studying functional segregation\u2014and increasingly integration [ ]\u2014reflecting its capacity to map distributed hemodynamic (blood oxygen level dependent or \u2018BOLD\u2019 signal) changes at the scale of millimetres over the entire human brain. Although BOLD signal changes are considered a marker of underlying neuronal activity, the neuronal basis of the fMRI signal remains the subject of intense investigation. This is largely because of its importance for understanding, modelling and inferring underlying brain processes [ , ]. Animal studies have shown that BOLD signal changes are most closely related to local field potentials in the high gamma-band range [ ] and reflect input and intra-cortical processing [ ]. However, there are discrepancies regarding which frequency band [ , , ] or combination of frequency bands [ , , ] is the best correlate of the BOLD signal, which could be task-, species- or brain system-dependent [ ]. There is further uncertainty about how BOLD responses relate to electrophysiological activity occurring at different frequencies, with both BOLD decreases and increases (relative to a task or state baseline) reported [ , ]. Previous studies have largely focused on particular frequencies or classical EEG frequency bands to predict BOLD changes; however, state-related EEG changes are often cross-spectral [ , ]. There have been reports of BOLD changes being well represented by the cross-spectral metrics of the overall EEG signal change such as the \u2018root mean square frequency\u2019 [ ], however, these models have not been tested in data with a wide spectral range or in different states such as during rest. \n\nFurthermore, the spatial aspect of this relationship is relatively neglected. For example, fluctuations in oscillatory activity, which may be related to information transfer and network control [ , ], recorded in one location, could index synaptic and metabolic changes in a remote region. Additionally, the spatial extent of electrophysiological activity (e.g., motor activity and motor inhibition) is likely to be distributed over several cortical areas [ , ]. \n\nIntracranial EEG recordings are performed for localisation purposes in some medically refractory patients with focal epilepsy who are candidates for epilepsy surgery; intracerebral depth electrodes that penetrate the brain (so-called \u2018depth EEG\u2019 or \u2018stereo-EEG\u2019: SEEG), provide exquisitely localised data, while subdural grid electrodes placed on the cortex (ECoG) capture activity over larger cortical regions. Importantly, these recordings do not attenuate high-frequency activity, unlike scalp EEG which suffers from inherent spatial-temporal filtering and muscle artefacts. While spatial sampling is limited by clinical considerations, icEEG has greater sensitivity and spatial specificity in relation to electrophysiological activity, compared to its scalp-based counterparts [ , ]. Finally, there is also more limited evidence of coupling between BOLD and electrophysiology in the resting state [ , , ] although some work has been performed to evaluate average responses to natural stimulus tasks applied to each modality sequentially in humans [ , , ]. \n\nIn this study, we used simultaneous ECoG-fMRI acquired in three patients with epilepsy during invasive pre-surgical investigations. ECoG coverage of the sensorimotor cortex provided a unique opportunity to explore the coupling between electrophysiology and fMRI, with exquisite spatial precision and greater spectral range than available from scalp recordings, while accounting for spontaneous activity and variability both during task and rest conditions. These patients were selected based on the suitability of the implantation coverage for the present analysis from a pre-surgical series with varied implantation configurations, each specified by the clinical team based exclusively on considerations related to their value for providing localizing information for putative curative surgery. Using these data, we were able to characterise the relationship between EEG activity and fMRI signal changes within the sensorimotor cortex during a motor task and contrast it with the equivalent coupling in the resting state. We aimed to determine: (1) the best model of BOLD changes, in particular, comparing frequency-specific and cross-spectral EEG models of fMRI; (2) if the best model was state dependent, and (3) characterise the sensitivity of this relationship to the colocalisation between the EEG and fMRI signals. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nThree patients with refractory focal epilepsy were studied based on the ECoG electrode coverage of the sensorimotor cortex that offered a good prospect of detecting effects related to a simple motor task. Following a comprehensive safety assessment to ensure accordance with safety guidelines and approval from our local ethics committee (Joint UCL\/UCLH), the participants were recruited and written informed consent obtained. Each patient underwent a tailored ECoG implantation ( ) based on the hypothesis generated from long-term scalp video-EEG recordings and other clinical data. \n\nA carefully devised experimental protocol was followed to ensure patient safety, based on testing of the exact experimental configuration used for scanning and a large margin of safety to account for possible differences between in vitro experiments and in vivo studies [ , , ]. Following completion of the clinical ECoG recordings, cables connecting the electrodes to the amplifiers were replaced by customized 90 cm cables for simultaneous ECoG-fMRI recording, bundled, rerouted to the vertex of the head, re-bandaged and laid out precisely along the scanner\u2019s central   z  -axis [ ]. All implanted electrodes were recorded from when amplifier capacity allowed, otherwise, targeted electrodes were selected ( ). \n\n### 2.1. Data Acquisition \n  \nWe performed MRI with a 1.5 T Siemens TIM Avanto scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a head transmit-receive coil, low SAR scans (\u22640.4 W\/Kg head average), exact electrode cable placement along the scanner and RF coils\u2019   Z  -axis running towards the head end of the [ ]. The following scans were performed (1) localiser, (2) FLASH T1-volume, TR\/TE\/flip angle = 150 ms\/4.49 ms\/25\u00b0, (3) 10 min gradient echo EPI (TR 3 s\/TE 40 ms\/flip angle 90\u00b0, 38 slices that were 2.5 mm thick with a 0.5 mm gap, 3 \u00d7 3 mm in-plane resolution) in the resting state where the patients were instructed to lie still with their eyes closed (4) 10 min gradient echo EPI where a visually cued opposing finger-to-thumb task was performed for 300 s with the same EPI parameters as above with 30 s blocks of left vs. right hand. In all subjects \n\nECoG signals were recorded using an MR-compatible amplifier system (128 channels) (Brain Products, Munich, Germany) during fMRI acquisitions. The EEG recording system sampling at 5000 Hz was synchronized to the scanner\u2019s 20 kHz gradient clock to allow direct correlation over time. The system was located at the head end of the scanner and ECG was recorded using a 16 bipolar channel ExG MR compatible system located at the patient\u2019s feet. Carbon fibre leads were used for the ECG recording in addition to spatial separation to prevent potential interactions between the intracranial electrodes and leads with the ECG; both were recorded using Brain Recorder (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Recordings sampled at 5000 Hz with subsequent filtering and down sampling to 250 Hz. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data Processing \n  \nScanning-related artefacts on EEG were removed using the Brain Analyser V1.3 (Brain Products, Munich, Germany) implementation of the template subtraction and filtering algorithm [ ] and data was referenced to the average. \n\nAll EPI images were realigned to the first image and spatially smoothed (FWHM 8 mm). The presence of significant fMRI changes correlated with the effect of interest (see below) was assessed voxel by voxel over the whole field of view using SPM software (  accessed on 15 October 2023) in Matlab (  accessed on 15 October 2023). \n\nFor the five-minute finger tap task, a standard block design was used in a general linear model\u2014with motion modelled as the six realignment parameters and a voxel-wise statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 family wise error corrected for multiple comparisons across voxels was applied to the ensuing SPM of t statistics. \n\nThe position of each electrode contact was determined on a CT scan (obtained for clinical purposes) co-registered to the space of the EPI data. The distance from each electrode contact to a cluster of fMRI activation was calculated as the minimum Cartesian distance over all voxels in the cluster. \n\nWe sought to characterise the coupling between the fMRI signal in the hand sensorimotor region and spatially distributed ECoG activity as a function of frequency for two brain states: rest and motor task. This was achieved by calculating the correlation over time between the fMRI signal averaged over the task-activated hand sensorimotor region and the fluctuations in ECoG power as a function of frequency and ECoG electrode contact location, after convolution with a hemodynamic response function (HRF) [ ] ( ): \n\nSpectral analyses were performed for each electrode contact on the gradient artefact corrected ECoG data using a Morlet wavelet transform [ ] as implemented in SPM8 (  accessed on 15 October 2023) with a wavelet factor value of 7, to obtain time-frequency data for each electrode at frequencies 1, 3, 5, \u2026, 99 Hz, giving time-frequency spectrograms at 2 Hz spectral sampling. \n\nThe primary hand sensorimotor region was defined as the fMRI task activated region. The realigned (but not spatially smoothed) data from this region was extracted and averaged before having first order drifts in fMRI signal removed. The time-frequency signals described above at frequencies 1, 3, 5, \u2026, 99 Hz were convolved with the standard \u2018canonical\u2019 HRF in SPM before being re-sampled at the time corresponding to the start of each scan. Local correlations were calculated between each ECoG-frequency model and the measured fMRI response from the hand sensorimotor region. This was performed for data obtained both during the task and periods of rest (as described above). A significance threshold of   p   < 0.001 was used, corresponding to a level of   p   < 0.05 Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons across frequencies. This represents a very conservative threshold because the EEG has significant correlations over frequencies (whereas Bonferroni correction assumes independence between each frequency). Given that the data is also spatially smooth (spatially non-independent) [ ] and the initial threshold is very conservative we did not correct further for multiple comparisons across electrode contacts. \n\nWe aimed to determine the best EEG-based model of fMRI fluctuations, at rest and during the task. We compared a family of models, grouped as follows: firstly, single- versus multiple-predictor models to determine if the fMRI could be best modelled by a single EEG feature or was best modelled by a more complex representation. Secondly, we compared models based on classical EEG frequency bands between themselves, and to cross-spectral EEG measures. \n\nFor the model comparison for each channel EEG, the time-frequency data described above was (1) averaged based on frequency-bands (delta: 1, 3 Hz; theta: 5, 7 Hz; alpha: 9, 11 Hz; beta: 13, 15, \u2026, 31; gamma Low: 33, 35, \u2026, 51 Hz; gamma high: 53, 55, \u2026, 99 Hz) before being convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and re-sampled at the start of each scan volume (3 s temporal resolution). \n\nModels were built with individual spectral band regressors (single predictors) and the power in all of the six chosen frequency-bands (multiple predictor model). Motion was modelled as the 6 realignment parameters and slow temporal drifts were modelled using a cosine filter or order 1. \n\nWe calculated each of the family of cross-spectral single predictor models described in the Appendix and compared them to the models based on classical frequency bands described above. Finally, we created a multiple predictor cross-spectral model using a parsimonious data driven model of the complete spectrogram by performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and taking the components that described >90% of the variance. Typically, this yielded the most complex model with 10\u201318 repressors giving an indication of the rich spectral information content of the intracranial EEG data. \n\n\n\n## 3. Model Comparison \n  \nBayesian model comparison (as implemented in   spm_PEB.m  , spm8 [ ]) was used to compare the different EEG-derived models\u2019 ability to predict the BOLD signal changes. The model evidence (log evidence) for each of the EEG-derived models described above was calculated and the relative evidence compared to the null model (containing motion and slow temporal drifts). In this context, a value of 3 is equivalent to 5\/100, and 20 to 1\/1000 of the model being better by chance (i.e., equivalent to a   p  -value of 0.05 and 0.001, respectively in classical statistics). It should be noted that the models are penalised for complexity and therefore the evidence scores the model that explains the most variance given the complexity; therefore, allowing for a conservative comparison of models with increased complexity. \n\n\n## 4. Results \n  \n### 4.1. Frequency-Specific ECoG-fMRI Correlation during a Motor Task vs. Resting State \n  \nFirst, we identified the electrode exhibiting the strongest correlation for each subject. The strongest correlation was always found at an electrode located either directly above the hand primary motor cortex or immediately posterior to the central sulcus ( a\u2013c). Note that due to the spatial relationship between the ECoG grid at the surface and the cortical folding, broadly, this contact was always overlying the motor cortex. During the motor task, the maximum positive correlation as a function of frequency was found in the high gamma band for all three subjects (91 Hz for subject #1 and 69 Hz for subjects #2 and #3,  a\u2013c, respectively, black) and the strongest negative correlation was found in the beta band (17 Hz for subject #1, 15 Hz for subject #2 and 29 Hz for subject #3). In the resting state, the profile of the coupling\u2014as a function of frequency\u2014was similar but the correlation was weaker and more variable between subjects ( a\u2013c, red). The most distinctive feature of the coupling profile during rest ( a\u2013c, black) was a significant negative correlation in the low beta range (<20 Hz). \n\nIn  a\u2013c, the correlation for each subject was mapped spatially over the cortex for the significant positive peak in correlation (gamma frequency range) and negative peak in correlation (beta frequency range, see  d\u2013f). \n\nThe dotted line represents the position of the central sulcus, and the numbers correspond to the electrodes numbering system (see  ); * indicates significant correlation   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. \n\nSecond, we investigated the coupling\u2019s spatial dimension by mapping the fMRI-ECoG correlation across the ECoG grid. During the task ( ) a region of very strong positive correlation at high gamma band frequencies was revealed at three post-central contacts located within 5 mm of the task-activated region ( a\u2013c). In the beta range a strong negative correlation was seen over a much wider area of cortex including cortex that was more distant from the task-activated region in the pre- and post-central cortex ( d\u2013f). During rest, the main feature was a significant (but weaker than during the task) negative correlation at frequencies in the alpha-beta range in all three subjects ( ). During the motor task in the beta band the region of negative correlation extended over a wide cortical area, extending beyond the primary motor cortex. \n\n\n### 4.2. Comparison of Frequency-Specific and Cross-Spectral EEG Models of fMRI \n  \nThe individual classical frequency band-based fMRI predictors were beta, and high gamma power based on previous observations [ ]. Two multiple-predictor models were designed to summarise the entire spectrogram: first, a previously used model comprising of the power in each of the classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low gamma and high gamma) [ ]; second, cross-spectral variation obtained by principal component analysis of spectrogram (the components explaining 90% of the EEG variance were used in the model, resulting in 10\u201318 regressors). All of these EEG predictors were convolved by the haemodynamic response function. Five cross-spectral summary metrics were designed to embody alternative aspects of the EEG spectrogram as a single predictor of BOLD changes. These consist of three spectral first order moments (\u2018means\u2019): the root mean squared frequency (so-called \u2018Kilner heuristic\u2019) (\u2018  q  \u2019) [ ], a modified version of the latter that amplifies the influence of the dominant frequency (\u2018  q  \u2019), the spectrogram centre of mass (  I  ); and two spectral second order moments: about its mean, and about 40 Hz (I40 Hz) based on the point of inflection for the correlation between fMRI signal and EEG in  . See   for definitions and the   for simulations illustrating the cross-spectral single predictor characteristics. \n\nModel evidence is shown for each model and subject relative to a \u2018null model\u2019 containing only nuisance regressors (six realignment parameters and a high pass cosine filter). A value of 3 is considered strong evidence (equivalent to   p   < 0.05), we considered the results to be significant across individuals when the sum was >9 and each subject individually had a positive model evidence. These values are shown in bold. \n\nThese comparisons were performed for the ECoG channel showing the highest correlation in the previous analysis (which in all subjects was within 5 mm of the task fMRI activation) and across all ECoG grid channels ( ) using empirical Bayesian model comparison [ ]. \n\n#### 4.2.1. Motor Task \n  \nFirst, we wanted to determine the best EEG-derived predictor of BOLD in the primary sensorimotor hand area during the motor (finger-tap) task, for the ECoG channel near (<5 mm Euclidian distance) to the fMRI activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex. We compared the log of the ratio of model evidence of each model to a model containing only nuisance effects [ ]. High gamma power was the best single-predictor electrophysiological measure of fMRI changes during the motor task. The PCA model performed similarly well, despite its increased complexity (which is strongly penalised by the model comparison method used) and was therefore both the best cross-spectral and multiple-predictor model. \n\nWe note that the multiple-predictor model based on classical frequency bands performed poorly compared to the other models, in particular, compared to the PCA model. This suggests that averaging within classical frequency bands destroyed significant predictive information. \n\nSecond, we examined the spatial distribution of model performance. The spatial maps of the log evidence for the best performing models in each category   q  , high beta- or gamma-band and PCA are shown in  . The high gamma band and   q   models are good predictors only for contacts that are highly co-localised, whereas the PCA model performs well from nearly all electrode contacts including in distal (hierarchically higher) brain areas. The beta band predictor was also a good model of BOLD changes over a wide region of cortex. This is consistent with the wider region of cortical inhibition during ipsilateral finger tapping. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that there is an electrographic representation of the task over a much wider region of cortex than that which shows strong fMRI changes\u2014and that this representation is distributed in a spatially structured way over frequencies. \n\n\n#### 4.2.2. Resting State \n  \nAt rest, the pattern was more variable between subjects and model evidence was lower across the board ( ). The PCA model performed best and was the only metric to be better than the null model in all subjects. The best cross-spectral single predictor model was the   q   and the best individual frequency band model was beta band power. In patient #1, although the PCA model was the best, model evidence was low. This may be due to the \u2018irritative zone\u2019 (generating interictal epileptic activity between seizures) overlapping with the primary sensorimotor region and disrupting normal ongoing resting-state activity. In the remaining subjects, there was strong evidence for the beta-band and PCA models explaining the BOLD signal fluctuations from the fMRI defined sensorimotor cortex. The spatial distribution of model performance at rest (see  ) showed that a PCA model performed well over the primary sensorimotor cortex in all subjects, as did beta frequency band power. In contrast to the task data, high-gamma power was not a good BOLD predictor most likely due to its relative absence in this state. \n\n\n\n\n## 5. Discussion \n  \nWe investigated the coupling between sensorimotor BOLD and electrophysiological signal variations in humans by mapping the correlation between the average fMRI signal from the hand sensorimotor region and frequency-specific ECoG signals. To do this, we used unique recordings of simultaneous electrophysiological signals on the surface of the human brain (ECoG) and whole-brain fMRI. In particular, the capability to record high-gamma activity over the motor cortex and fMRI together in humans enabled us to study the coupling between electrophysiological and hemodynamic fMRI signals as a function of brain state and localization. The intracranial EEG signal has been shown to be of high fidelity and able to record high frequency activity [ ]. \n\n### 5.1. Local Coupling \n  \nIn summary, we found task-related BOLD to reflect mainly high gamma-frequency power fluctuations in the local vicinity of the fMRI activated region. In contrast, at rest, beta power in spatially distributed contacts best predicted (inversely) BOLD signal changes. The best BOLD predictor based on a single cross-spectral metric was   q   which models fMRI changes as shifts in the mean of the square of the spectral power such as those that can result from power fluctuations at specific frequencies (see   for details on the cross-spectral metrics\u2019 behaviour). This is consistent with the notion of at least partially independent neuronal sources of EEG changes at specific frequencies [ ]. There were distinct peaks in the alpha-beta range with higher correlation ( ), suggesting that there was a relationship between specific oscillatory activity and fMRI signal changes. In contrast, at high gamma frequencies, there was a high correlation across a broad frequency range. We found the PCA-derived model performed best across task and rest, and when considering the electrophysiological activity recorded over the entire ECoG grid. This model retains variance either from power changes at a given frequency or frequency shifts of any nature\u2014it is simply a parsimonious description of the entire spectrogram. Taken together this may explain the PCA model\u2019s large performance advantage over a model containing classical frequency band which have previously been suggested to be optimal [ ]. \n\n\n### 5.2. Spatial Coupling Aspects \n  \nWe found task-related BOLD to reflect mainly high gamma-frequency broad-band power fluctuations in the vicinity of the BOLD response while beta band activity over a much larger cortical area was inversely correlated with the fMRI activity. \n\nAt rest, beta power in spatially distributed contacts (inversely) predicted BOLD signal changes but there was not the same focal positively collocated gamma activity. The beta-band activity was prevalent during rest and during contralateral hand movements, inversely correlating with fMRI over a wide area of the sensorimotor cortex. This confirms it as a general feature when attending to or suppressing movement [ ]. In contrast, gamma activity was highly localised in motor regions and only present during motor activity. It is possible that the relatively low power of the gamma activity made it more difficult to measure in the context of greater noise levels in ECoG recordings during fMRI although we have previously performed evaluation of this data [ ]. \n\n\n### 5.3. Novelty of Our Electrophysiological BOLD Predictors \n  \nSome of our findings confirm previous reports: for example, gamma-band activity was strongly coupled to BOLD [ , , ], but only during the task. Strong positive correlations in the gamma-band were found in conjunction with an inverse relationship at lower to mid frequency bands consistent with the idea that fMRI signal increases reflect shifts in EEG power from low to high frequencies [ ]. These findings ( a\u2013c) are consistent with studies in the auditory cortex using non-simultaneous fMRI (pre-operative) and ECoG in two patients with epilepsy [ ]. \n\nIn the resting state, the coupling was reduced, although it had a similar form to the frequency dependence seen during the task ( ). Beta-band power was the most predictive frequency-specific predictor of BOLD changes during rest (and was inversely correlated), potentially indexing the relative level of cortical inhibition, consistent with a scalp EEG-fMRI study [ ]. \n\nThe best cross-spectral metric was   q   which allowed for fMRI changes both from shifts in power from low to high frequencies and increased power within a frequency in the absence of other changes at specific frequencies (see the   for the details of the cross-spectral metrics). This might be expected given that different neuronal populations are thought to be responsible for generating these signals [ ]. \n\nWe also evaluated multiple predictor models based on classical frequency bands and a cross-spectral model using PCA of the entire spectrogram. When considering all brain states and whether or not the ECoG channel was close to the fMRI region, we found the BOLD responses were best predicted by the PCA multi-spectral model. Because the PCA model is substantially more complex, it must explain far more BOLD variance than any other model to retain the greatest model evidence on marginal likelihood, given that our model comparison heavily penalises model complexity. Crucially, and in contrast to previous studies in the non-human primate visual cortex [ ], our data does not support the multiple predictor model based on the classical frequency-bands as the best predictor of BOLD. This may be explained by the fact that our model comparison properly penalised model complexity\u2014but could also be due to differences between brain regions and species. \n\nPrevious studies have found some variability in the neurophysiological features that best explain BOLD fMRI changes from both single spectral EEG frequencies, cross-spectral models [ ] or models containing several frequency bands [ ]. Crucially we have demonstrated that the results of these analyses are sensitive both to the subject\u2019s state and to the spatial relationship between the two modalities. \n\nOur results suggest that focal fMRI changes are accompanied by widespread EEG changes. The EEG changes predicting fMRI were not limited to specific frequencies or a close co-localisation; therefore, a cross-spectral PCA model is likely to be effective when looking at different brain regions that exhibit activity at different frequencies. From the reverse perspective, this suggests that fMRI changes can be linked to a plethora of EEG changes and cannot be in general interpreted as relating to a single specific EEG feature. The exception to this rule was found during the activity of primary cortex, where there was a close correspondence between high gamma power and fMRI, consistent with previous studies [ , , , ]. This is entirely consistent with predictive modelling of resting state connectivity in EEG and fMRI, where EEG connectivity in all frequency bands could predict fMRI to a greater extent than fMRI could predict EEG based connectivity [ ]. \n\nThe ability of ECoG-fMRI to demonstrate the link between fMRI fluctuations and (oscillatory) neural activity should help refine biophysical models, particularly in accounting for the emerging properties of neuronal populations (e.g., ref. [ ]) and for subsequent application in pathology [ ]. More generally, the characterisation of the coupling shown here, in different brain states, represents vital information for the interpretation of fMRI responses in terms of the underlying processing [ ]. For example, it can be crucial for informing and validating efforts to model the underlying distributed brain responses such as the effective connectivity between neuronal populations [ ]. There is increasing evidence of cortical layer specific spectral features of the EEG signal [ ]. This would provide a biophysical explanation of the potential independent contributions to BOLD changes [ ]. The strong predictive performance of the PCA model suggests that there are widespread cortical EEG changes that reflect focal BOLD signal changes and this complexity, if characterised, could provide important new information and avoid the misinterpretation of neurophysiological and fMRI comparisons. \n\n\n### 5.4. Epilepsy and ECoG-fMRI: Feature for Study and Potential Confound \n  \nThe patients studied suffer from epilepsy so inferring behaviour in the healthy population requires some caution. However, electrode placement strategies are designed to test contrasting localisation hypotheses (devised following the results of non-invasive tests) and frequently include electrodes placed within or over regions presumed to be unaffected to map the eloquent cortex. Intracranial EEG recordings in patients with epilepsy represent a unique opportunity to access a wide range of brain regions for study under conditions involving relatively normal physiology (e.g., ref. [ ]). \n\nThe ECoG is exquisitely sensitive to local epileptic electrophysiological features, which should enable the effects of epilepsy to be accurately modelled and removed from studies aiming to make inferences about \u2018normal\u2019 brain function. This also provides an opportunity to map and understand fMRI changes associated with epileptiform events, including high frequency oscillations [ , , ] with unprecedented sensitivity, because we have demonstrated the ability to utilise high frequency ECoG data obtained with simultaneous fMRI. \n\n\n### 5.5. Further Limitations \n  \nOwing to the rarity of patients with highly similar implantations and the extremely challenging logistic constraints imposed by the limited amount of time that the icEEG electrodes are in situ, but not available to record clinically useful data, it is not easily possible to study large groups. Despite a level of reproducibility across our three subjects, we acknowledge that these numbers preclude high confidence in their generalisation. \n\nWhile the relationship between BOLD fMRI and EEG is important to understand because it underlies the neurobiological interpretation of fMRI results it does not have clear clinical significance and might be altered in pathology. \n\n\n\n## 6. Conclusions \n  \nDuring motor activity, high gamma power was the only frequency band where the electrophysiological response was co-localised with fMRI measures across all subjects. The best model of fMRI changes across states was its principal components, a parsimonious description of the entire ECoG spectrogram. This model performed much better than any others that were either based on the classical frequency bands or summary measures of cross-spectral changes. The region-specific fMRI signal is reflected in spatially and spectrally distributed EEG activity. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10968112,"text_md5":"f62804ffd04066e44fc21d21e9e35d1e","field_positions":{"authors":[0,178],"journal":[179,201],"publication_year":[203,207],"title":[218,308],"keywords":[322,398],"abstract":[411,1491],"body":[1500,33404]},"batch":1,"pmid":38534498,"doi":"10.3390\/bioengineering11030224","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10968112","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10968112"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10968112\">10968112<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10968112  Measurement of the Mapping between Intracranial EEG and fMRI Recordings in the Human Brain"}

We investigated neural responses of emotional processing, by considering inter\u2010individual synchronization in subjective emotional engagement and disengagement. The neural underpinnings of these shared responses are ideally studied in naturalistic scenarios like movie viewing, wherein individuals emotionally engage and disengage at their own time and pace throughout the course of a narrative. Despite the rich data that naturalistic designs can bring to the study, there is a challenge in determining time\u2010resolved behavioral markers of subjective engagement and disengagement and their underlying neural responses. We used a within\u2010subject cross\u2010over design instructing 22 subjects to watch clips of either neutral or sad content while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants watched the same movies a second time while continuously annotating the perceived emotional intensity, thus enabling the mapping of brain activity and emotional experience. Our analyses revealed that between\u2010participant similarity in waxing (engagement) and waning (disengagement) of emotional intensity was directly related to the between\u2010participant similarity in spatiotemporal patterns of brain activation during the movie(s). Similar patterns of engagement reflected common activation in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex, regions often involved in self\u2010referenced evaluation and generation of negative emotions. Similar patterns of disengagement reflected common activation in central executive and default mode network regions often involved in top\u2010down emotion regulation. Together this work helps to better understand cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning engagement and disengagement from emotionally evocative narratives. \n  \nSubjective disengagement, as opposed to engagement, shows stronger inter\u2010individual alignment, specifically during sad movies, suggesting a collective response to emotional material. We identified two distinctive neural response synchronization patterns underlying engagement and disengagement, potentially supporting emotion regulation and self\u2010referenced evaluation of emotional material.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSome individuals have little trouble disengaging from a negative emotional experience, while others struggle to disengage or even over\u2010engage (Blicher et al.,\u00a0 ; Koole,\u00a0 ; Rudaizky et al.,\u00a0 ; Scherer et al.,\u00a0 ). The neural signatures that give rise to these individual differences are poorly understood. This is partly owed to a long tradition in the field of controlled task designs optimized to assess shared responses for group\u2010level inferences rather than inter\u2010individual variability (Finn et al.,\u00a0 ). How humans engage and disengage from emotional experiences has traditionally been investigated using highly controlled scenarios wherein individuals attend and react to isolated emotional stimuli, such as pictures or short audio\u2010visual stimuli (Braunstein et al.,\u00a0 ). This kind of approach obscures the fact that emotions never emerge on their own independently, but are often embedded in an ongoing narrative with varying emotional intensity and valence, determining where to and for how long we direct our attention. Naturalistic designs, such as movie watching, address this issue: events are connected through a common temporally evolving narrative allowing individuals to engage, disengage, and re\u2010engage at varying time points and for different lengths of time. Despite or because of this rich dynamic scenario, behavioral and neural markers underlying engagement and disengagement have been difficult to characterize. \n\nIn the context of this study, we employ our measure to explore emotional engagement and disengagement at the behavioral level. These episodes within the emotional process lack a definitive and precise description within the domain of neuroscience. This lack of clarity is acknowledged by Dmochowski, who advocates for the inclusion of specific operational definitions based on the context under investigation (Dmochowski et al.,\u00a0 ). For instance, within the educational realm, emotional engagement (EE) is defined as affective responses that encompass a sense of belonging within the school environment, while emotional disengagement (ED) pertains to the withdrawal from educational activities (Steenberghs et al.,\u00a0 ). Conversely, beyond the educational sphere, EE has been defined by Steenberghs and colleagues as the degree of emotional salience. Fitz and collaborators, on the other hand, characterize EE as mindful awareness and ED as distraction (Fitzpatrick & Kuo,\u00a0 ). Hence, we establish operational definitions for these episodes as the positive or negative changes, respectively, in the intensity of emotional impact (affective state) experienced by individuals during varying moments throughout the movie. \n\nContinuous physiological markers like heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation have been previously recorded during movie watching (Hasson et al.,\u00a0 ; Nguyen et al.,\u00a0 ; Sharma et al.,\u00a0 ; van der Meer et al.,\u00a0 ), but their roles in engagement and disengagement are poorly understood. In contrast, continuous subjective annotations have been used to map fluctuations of emotional arousal or emotional intensity, indicating how emotionally moved one feels from moment to moment throughout movie watching (Hudson et al.,\u00a0 ; Nummenmaa et al.,\u00a0 ; Song et al.,\u00a0 ; Wallentin et al.,\u00a0 ). A common approach is to watch the same movie twice, retroactively providing continuous annotations during the second watch which reflect one's emotional arousal whilst watching the movie for the first time (Canini et al.,\u00a0 ; Hanjalic & Xu,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Ruef & Levenson,\u00a0 ). While real\u2010time annotations during scanning affect neural responses to emotional stimulation (therefore obstructing attempts at brain imaging), repeated movie watching only minimally affects subjective annotations (Hutcherson et al.,\u00a0 ; Lieberman et al.,\u00a0 ), as demonstrated by high test\u2013retest reliability (Cronbach's   =\u20090.8\u20130.9; Metallinou & Narayanan,\u00a0 ). In this regard, fluctuations in subjectively experienced emotional intensity could help identify alternations between engagement   in   and disengagement   from   emotional stimuli throughout movie watching. \n\nA prominent approach to detect shared neural responses in naturalistic designs is inter\u2010subject correlation analysis (ISC), which evaluates how neural responses synchronize across subjects when they process the same stimulus at the same time (Hasson et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, higher and lower neural synchronization would reflect more and less similar stimulus processing, respectively. Even though this assumption implies that shared neural responses should reflect shared behavioral responses, it has been rarely investigated if shared neural responses indeed underlie shared behavioral responses. Instead, associations to behavior have been based on individual magnitudes, such as individual scoring on a questionnaire as opposed to the degree of inter\u2010individual similarity (but see Chen et al. ( ) and supplement in in Nummenmaa et al. ( )). Thus, given the sparse understanding of how individuals resemble each other in their subjective emotional experiences during naturalistic designs, their underlying shared neural responses are poorly understood. \n\nUsing more trial\u2010based designs, several studies have shown that the ventro\u2010medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is involved in both the generation and regulation of negative emotions and might be a relay for generalizable representations of negative emotions (Kragel et al.,\u00a0 ). Further, the vmPFC has been involved in self\u2010referenced evaluation such as self\u2010attributing personality traits or recalling autobiographical memories (Northoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Svoboda et al.,\u00a0 ). Not only during movie viewing but even in the absence of sensory stimulation (resting state), the vmPFC exhibits higher inter\u2010individual variations in neural responses as compared to other brain regions (see L. Chang et al.,\u00a0 , L. J. Chang et al.,  , Hasson et al.,\u00a0 , Hasson et al.,  , and Xie et al.,  , for naturalistic paradigms and Mueller et al.,  , for resting state). \n\nPrevious work has shown across two different data sets (movie and audio\u2010book) that the degree to which neural responses synchronized within the default mode network (DMN) was related to how engaging the narrative was perceived (Song et al.,\u00a0 ). The researchers conclude that the DMN could reflect \u201ca modality\u2010general network involved in attention and narrative processing\u201d (2021). In their study, neural synchronization was related to a group manifold of continuous subjective engagement derived from an independent sample that was not scanned. Thus, it is still unclear whether and, if so, to which degree, neural synchronization occurs as a function of synchronized subjective engagement and disengagement, which would require both scanning and subjective annotations within one and the same individuals. Further, we hypothesized individuals would alternate between discrete moments of engagement   in   and disengagement   from   a narrative. Rather than being interested in the neural activity associated with moments of engagement and disengagement, we sought to investigate how similar patterns of emotional engagement and disengagement were reflected in synchronized patterns of spatiotemporal brain activity across the entire movie clip. \n\nTo address these research questions, we instructed 22 subjects to watch two movie clips\u2014one with sad and one with neutral content\u2014while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Roughly 15\u2009minutes\u00a0after the scanning session and outside of the scanner, subjects watched the same movies again while simultaneously annotating their ongoing continuous perceived emotional intensity. We hypothesized that greater synchronization patterns in subject annotations throughout moments of engagement and disengagement ought to be reflected in distinct synchronization of neural response patterns. Specifically, we speculate that engagement and disengagement similarity patterns should reflect brain regions associated with more similar self\u2010referential evaluation of emotions and top\u2010down regulation, respectively. \n\nAs outlined above, we hypothesized the vmPFC to be a critical region for subjective emotion processing. However, given the novelty of the method mapping bi\u2010directional similarity (in both behavior and the brain), we conducted our analysis including brain regions related to emotional and perceptual processing. Alignments in engagement reports were related to more synchronized neural responses mainly within the bilateral vmPFC, together with limbic and visual areas. In contrast, alignments in disengagement reports were related to more synchronized neural responses within frontally distributed regions of the executive and DMN networks. Together these findings suggest the presence of disparate neural systems possibly supporting appraisal of affective relevance and top\u2010down emotion regulation, respectively. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty\u2010two females (aged 20\u201349\u2009years, mean age 28.1   6.5), volunteered for the study. Subjects were screened for absence of any neurological or psychiatric disorders using the short version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u2010IV (SCID; Wittchen et al.,\u00a0 ). The study protocols were in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of the Charit\u00e9, Germany. The data were previously published with completely different research questions, without involving continuous annotations of emotional intensitys (Borchardt et al.,\u00a0 ; Fan et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Task paradigm \n  \nTo investigate inter\u2010individually shared patterns of neural responses together with inter\u2010individually shared patterns of subjective emotional intensity responses, we presented two movie clips of either sad or neutral content. The sad clip was an excerpt from the movie \u201c21 Grams\u201d (I\u00f1\u00e1rritu,\u00a0 ) which presents a mother learning about the death of her two daughters in a car accident. The video excerpt has a duration of 4.45\u2009min. The neutral clip was an excerpt from the movie \u201cLa Stanza Del Figlio\u201d (Moretti,\u00a0 ), where scenes of a family are presented in daily life (e.g., having a casual conversation at the dinner table, reading the newspaper) with a duration of 4.54\u2009min. We selected the neutral clip based on its resemblance to the sad clip in terms of low\u2010level features, such as the presence of human faces, scenes of social interaction, and domestic environments. Both movie clips were shown in dubbed German version. These movies have been used in previous studies to induce sad and neutral emotions respectively (Borchardt et al.,\u00a0 ; Gaviria et al.,\u00a0 ; Hanich et al.,\u00a0 ; Shiota & Levenson,\u00a0 ). Every subject started with a 10\u2010min resting\u2010state recording, followed by the presentation of one of the two movie clips. No specific instructions were given other than watching the movie clips. The order of presentation of the movie clips was counterbalanced across subjects. To minimize possible carry over effects, 15\u2009min of resting state was recorded between both movies. After the second movie, another resting state of 10\u2009min was recorded. \n\n\n### Subjective ratings \n  \nTo assess the overall emotional induction experience of watching these video clips, measures of different emotional dimensions have been previously reported on this data. Specifically, subjects reported higher scores on arousal, dominance, and one's own emotional experience in the negative video compared to the neutral one. Additionally, the negative video was rated as significantly more negative than the neutral video (Borchardt et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Subjective continuous annotations \n  \nRoughly 20\u2009min after the scanning session and outside of the scanner, subjects watched both movie clips again in the same order as presented in the scanner while concurrently annotating how emotionally moving their experience was with regard to when they first watched the movie (Figure\u00a0 ). The instruction was as follows: \u201cFollowing, are 2 short ratings of the movie clips that you previously watched. You are going to see both movie clips again on the PC screen and are subsequently asked to rate how emotional you felt while watching.\u201d (German original in supplement). Subjective emotional intensity annotations were performed through a visual analog scale in which respondents move the mouse to the desired position from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much\u201d (emotionally moving) in a vertical bar on the right side of the screen. The scale was arbitrary ranging from 0 to 250, where 0 was set as \u201cnot emotionally moving\u201d and 250 as \u201cvery emotionally moving\u201d. The annotations were recorded with a sampling rate of 30\u2009Hz and then down\u2010sampled to the MRI scanner sampling rate (0.5\u2009Hz). \n  \nSubjective emotional intensity annotations for the sad and the neutral movie clip (top and bottom, respectively). Individual time courses are shown in color; the degree of similarity of annotations across participants is shown in black (Euclidean distance based). Grey segments show three movie scenes with the highest annotation accordance (distance >2 standard deviations above the mean). \n  \n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nFunctional MRI images were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3\u2009T scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12\u2010channel radiofrequency head coil, using a T2*\u2010weighted Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence (37 axial slices of 3\u2009mm thickness covering the whole brain, TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, 70\u00b0 flip angle, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, field of view\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192  , in\u2010plane resolution\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093  ). The natural\u2010viewing sessions consisted of 147 volumes. T1\u2010weighted anatomical reference images were acquired using 3D\u2010MPRAGE sequence (176 sagittal slices covering the whole brain, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091   isotropic resolution, TR\u2009=\u20091900\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.52\u2009ms, 9\u00b0 flip angle, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing was performed using fMRIprep 1.3.2 (Esteban et al.,\u00a0 ), which is based on Nipype 1.1.9 (K. Gorgolewski et al.,\u00a0 ; K. J. Gorgolewski et al.,\u00a0 ). Steps included slice time and motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, realignment, smoothing, and registration to common space. ICA\u2010AROMA was performed to identify and remove motion\u2010related components (Pruim et al.,\u00a0 ). Physiological nuisance was corrected by extracting the mean time course of cerebrospinal\u2010fluid (CSF) and white matter (WM) calculated from the preprocessed images; this method of motion correction was chosen after comparing to two other sets with different motion correction methods: (1) FIX (Griffanti et al.,\u00a0 ; Salimi\u2010Khorshidi et al.,\u00a0 ) and (2) only ICA, by assessing the quality and validation of functional images through visual inspection of the group independent components according to the criteria described in Griffanti et al. ( ). The first two volumes of fMRI sequence of both movies were discarded to avoid T1 saturation effect. \n\n\n### Neurosynth brain parcellation and term maps \n  \nWe used a brain parcellation from the Neurosynth database provided by Vega et al.\u00a0( ;  ). Since the parcellation does not consider parcels for each hemisphere individually, we performed a division of parcels into both hemispheres. We then used search terms that are associated with our research question to identify regions of interest within this parcellation, resulting in a total of 119\u2010ROIs. This ROI identification was performed by using uniformity test statistical inference maps (Yarkoni et al.,\u00a0 ). These maps provide a consistent measure of each voxel to be activated across studies that is associated with the search terms of interest. We then used the uniformity test statistical inference maps to identify our regions of interest within the Neurosynth parcellation by including a parcel if the occupancy volume is larger than 30% (Bossier et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe search terms were chosen based on previous work on naturalistic stimulus processing highlighting the importance of lower\u2010level sensory (\u201cvisual perception\u201d and \u201cauditory\u201d) and higher\u2010level cognitive features like emotion processing (\u201cemotional responses\u201d, \u201csad\u201d, \u201carousal\u201d, \u201ccognitive\u2010emotional\u201d) and self\u2010reflection (\u201cawareness\u201d; see Table\u00a0 ; see Saarim\u00e4ki,  ). Further, as an exploratory analysis, instead of treating brain regions as individual entities, we repeated our analysis assuming brain regions belonging to one search term as one single parcel. \n\nThe terms were chosen based on the literature on naturalistic stimulus processing (2021), taking into consideration sensory (visual perception and auditory) and higher\u2010level cognitive features for movie viewing, emotion processing and subjective ratings and self\u2010reflection (sad, arousal, awareness, emotional responses and cognitive\u2010emotional; see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Emotional engagement and disengagement \n  \nOur first aim was to isolate moments in time when individuals indicated the beginning of emotional engagement and disengagement. We hypothesized that these two phases of emotion processing could be derived from rises and falls from continuous fluctuations of subjective emotional intensity annotations. Specifically, we isolated time points where subjective emotional intensity scores fulfilled two conditions: they (a) exhibit a positive difference between two time points (engagement), or a negative difference between two time points (disengagement) and (b) fall within an intra\u2010individually defined threshold (33rd >emotional intensity at time point   t   <67th percentile). This algorithm has been previously used to extract phases in neural oscillations (Dessu et al.,\u00a0 ; Kato et al.,\u00a0 ; Shine et al.,\u00a0 ). The outcome of this calculation results in individual onsets of engagement and disengagement, manifesting as binary variables (see Figure\u00a0 ). Subsequently, these derived onsets were employed in the computation of ISC. We sought to specifically extract rises and falls as opposed to rare highs and lows, because they are more frequent and short\u2010lived, and thus provide higher sensitivity to individual differences in engagement and disengagement. \n\n\n### Inter\u2010subject correlation analyses \n  \n#### Synchronization of neural responses \n  \nWe first sought to assess to what degree subjects align with either behavioral or neural responses. To this aim, we used inter\u2010subject\u2010correlation (ISC: Hasson et al.,\u00a0 ). First, we extracted the BOLD time series data for each entire brain parcel from individual participants. Subsequently, for each brain parcel, we calculated Pearson correlation distance among all possible pairs of BOLD time courses derived from subject\u2010specific parcels. This process yielded a single ISC score for each individual parcel. For mapping inter\u2010subject similarities in behavior, we calculated Pearson correlation distance within all possible pairs of subjects' subjective emotional annotations. \n\nPearson correlation distance, defined as: where   and   are a pair of vectors with   observations. Intuitively, by subtracting the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient from 1, we get a   correlation matrix (Figure\u00a0 ) containing all pair\u2010wise distances between each participant. ISC analysis was performed using functions from nltools package (L. Chang et al.,\u00a0 ). \n  \nScheme for how Inter\u2010Subject Representational Similarity Analysis (IS\u2010RSA) maps the association between inter\u2010individually shared subjective emotional intensity responses and inter\u2010individually shared neural responses. From left to right: (a) BOLD time series of a brain region of interest (top) and emotional intensity time series from subjective annotations (bottom) are extracted for each subject separately. (b) Inter\u2010subject similarity is then calculated for neural responses in that representative brain region (top) and for subjective annotation time courses (bottom). Thus, every parcel in the triangle depicts the correlation strength between two individuals' signal time courses. These neural inter\u2010subject correlation coefficients (upper triangle) and behavioral inter\u2010subject coefficients (lower triangle) are then correlated with each other (panel c; color indicates density of ISC scores, with darker colors indicating lower, and brighter colors indicating higher density of ISCs). The resulting correlation coefficient is then transformed into correlation distance for better interpretability (d). This analysis was repeated with different transformations of the subjective annotations: (1) by dichotomizing the subject's emotional annotation time course into moments of increases (yes\/no), here called engagement, and (2) by dichotomizing a subject's emotional annotation time course into moments of decreases (yes\/no), here called disengagement (see Section\u00a0 ). To assess inter\u2010subject similarity between these binary time courses, Hamming correlation was performed instead of Pearson correlation. ISC, inter\u2010subject\u2010correlation. \n  \n\n#### Synchronization of subjective emotional engagement and disengagement \n  \nUtilizing Hamming distance for dichotomous variables (Ayala et al.,\u00a0 ), we computed ISC coefficients for the previously estimated engagement and disengagement episodes. This analysis resulted in two between\u2010subject correlation matrices (one for engagement and one for disengagement). ISC coefficients for the continuous annotations (no distinction of phases) were also calculated by using Pearson correlation distance. \n\n\n\n### Subjective emotional intensity annotations \n  \nTo examine if inter\u2010subject correlation (ISC) of emotional engagement and disengagement differ across neutral and sad movies, we built a linear mixed effects regression model (Baayen et al.,\u00a0 ) predicting ISC based on phase type (engagement\/dis\u2010engagement) and emotion category (sad\/neutral), with subject pair ID as a random intercept. Linear and generalized mixed effects modeling was performed using the lme4 package in R (Bates et al.,\u00a0 ). Correction for multiple comparisons was performed with the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach Benjamini\u2013Hochberg (Benjamini & Hochberg,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Inter\u2010subject representation similarity analysis \n  \nHaving investigated behavioral and neural similarity, we next sought to understand the association between the two. That is, we wondered if the degree of similar behavioral responses was systematically related to how a brain region's neural responses synchronizes across individuals. To this aim, we used inter\u2010subject representation similarity analysis by calculating Spearman distance correlation between ISC scores of brain parcel's BOLD time courses and ISC scores of individuals' subjective emotional intensity time courses. A mantel permutation test (Mantel,\u00a0 ) was performed, which calculates for each random permutation (10,000) a set of correlations by shuffling rows and columns of each subject correlation matrix, creating a null distribution to calculate   p  \u2010values based on a one\u2010tail test with the alternative hypothesis being the correlations greater than 0. Finally, permuted   p  \u2010values were thresholded with FDR (from nltools [L. Chang et al.,\u00a0 ]) method (Benjamini & Yekutieli,\u00a0 ) to correct for multiple comparisons (119 regions). This resulted in Spearman correlation coefficients falling on a scale bounded between \u22121 and +1. For ISC analysis and the ISC\u2010RSA, we used codes by Chen et al.\u00a0( ;  ) under the python environment (Python 3.7.12; Van Rossum & Drake,\u00a0 ). To avoid misinterpretations in the context of RSA (for discussion see Dimsdale\u2010Zucker and Ranganath ( )), we re\u2010scaled Spearman correlation coefficients using a correlation distance metric   Kaufman & Rousseeuw,\u00a0 ). This approach transforms coefficients to a range between 0 and +2, where values close to zero represent higher similarity (Popal et al.,\u00a0 ), as previously done in studies using RSA (Kiani et al.,\u00a0 ; Kriegeskorte et al.,\u00a0 ; Kriegeskorte & Kievit,\u00a0 ). \n\nInstead of treating each ROI as an individual unit, we sought to repeat our analyses by treating all ROIs corresponding to each search term (arousal, auditory, awareness, cognitive emotional, emotional responses, sad and visual perception) entered into the neurosynth database as one system: for each subject, we first extracted individual BOLD timeseries of each parcel belonging to a search term. We then aggregated over the individual parcel time courses resulting in one time course per search term and subject. Then, ISC was performed for each subject's search term time series, resulting in a ISC matrix per term. Finally, we applied the RSA as outlined above (see Section\u00a0 ) correlating the search term ISC matrix and behavior ISC matrix. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Subjective emotional intensity annotations \n  \nWe hypothesized that the emotionally evocative sad movie would result in (1) higher synchronization of emotional reports and (2) higher scores of subjective emotional intensity across subjects in contrast to the neutral movie. Paired t\u2010tests showed that the mean continuous annotations of subjective emotional intensity were significantly higher for the sad as compared to the neutral movie clip across movies (  t  (21)\u2009=\u20097.37,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001). Using mixed\u2010effects modeling it was shown that the sad movie clip was associated with higher inter\u2010individual similarity as compared to the neutral movie clip (sad vs. neutral:   =\u20091.56; 95% CI: [1.45, 1.67],  ; see Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nEstimated inter\u2010subject similarity of behavioral and neural responses as a function of emotion induction condition (sad\/neutral movie) using linear\u2010mixed effects modeling. (a) Inter\u2010subject similarity in engaging and disengaging phases, derived from rises and falls in subjective emotional intensity annotations, respectively. (b) Estimated inter\u2010subject similarity in continuous subjective emotional intensity. (c) Inter\u2010subject similarity in neural responses throughout the 119 regions of interest  . ISC, inter\u2010subject correlation. \n  \nWe further examined if the degree of inter\u2010individual similarity varied as a function of if individuals engage or disengaged and if this association differs for the neutral movie clip. Engagement and disengagement were identified by increases and decreases in subjective emotional intensity annotations, by (1) considering the direction of signal change and (2) the range of the signal defined by within\u2010subject percentile thresholds (see Section\u00a0 ). \n\nFor the sad movie, there were on average 6.90   4.82 engagement phases and 2.40   3.14 disengagement phases (see Figure\u00a0 ) with a mean duration of 13.81   9.65 and 4.81   6.28\u2009seconds, respectively. For the neutral movie, there were on average 1.31   1.64 engagement phases and 0.9   1.63 disengagement phases, with a mean duration of 2.63   3.28 and 1.81   3.26\u2009s in engagement and disengagement, respectively (see Figure\u00a0 ). During the sad movie, for 10 subjects disengagement phases were absent. Note that the absence of phases does not exclude subjects from the analyses but instead provides valuable information for the calculation of inter\u2010subject correlation analysis. For the neutral movie, 10 subjects had no engagement and 13 subjects had no disengagement phases, of which 10 had neither engagement nor disengagement phases. \n\nNext, we built a mixed effects model assessing how the inter\u2010subject similarity of subjective emotional intensity annotations varied as a function of emotional category (sad\/neutral) and emotional phase (engagement\/disengagement). There was a significant main effect of emotional category (sad vs. neutral:   =\u20092.14; 95% CI: [2.10, 2.17],  ), indicating that the inter\u2010subject similarity was higher during sad as opposed to the neutral condition (Table\u00a0 ). There was a significant interaction of emotional category with phase (engagement vs. disengagement:   = \u22120.41; 95% CI: [\u22120.46, \u22120.36],  ), indicating that, for the sad movie clip, subjects were more similar to each other in disengagement as opposed to engagement phases. Taken together, compared to the neutral movie, the sad movie induced higher similarity in subjective emotional processing as indicated by higher inter\u2010subject similarity in subjective emotional intensity annotations, and subjects aligned more strongly in their disengagement as opposed to engagement behavior. Critically, this differential effect for engagement and disengagement was only present during the sad, but not the neutral movie (Figure\u00a0 ), suggesting that the sad movie elicited more consistent emotional fluctuations than the neutral one. \n\n\n### Inter\u2010subject similarity in neural responses \n  \nGiven previous research reporting that individuals synchronize their neural responses during more engaging parts of a movie (Gruskin et al.,\u00a0 ; Maffei,\u00a0 ; Sachs et al.,\u00a0 ; Song et al.,\u00a0 ; Trost et al.,\u00a0 ), we sought to replicate this finding in our data. We first calculated ISCs for each of the 119 brain regions for every movie clip (sad\/neutral), separately. We then constructed a mixed effects model predicting ISC scores as a function of movie clip (sad\/neutral). This analysis revealed significantly higher brain\u2010wide inter\u2010subject similarity in neural responses for the sad as compared to the neutral movie condition (sad vs. neutral:   =\u20090.42; 95% CI: [0.32, 0.52],  ; see Table\u00a0 ). Higher ISC values were concentrated in occipital and temporal areas involving the right occipital fusiform gyrus (mean ISC\u2009=\u2009.51), followed by the left and right lingual gyrus (mean ISC\u2009=\u2009.51 and .51, respectively). For the neutral condition, higher ISC values were concentrated in occipital areas (Figure\u00a0 ), such as the left and right lingual gyrus (mean ISC\u2009=\u2009.40; .35) and the occipital pole (mean ISC\u2009=\u2009.37). \n\n\n### Inter\u2010subject representational similarity analysis \n  \nNow that we established that the sad movie clip was associated with (1) stronger alignments in emotional intensity annotations and (2) stronger alignments in neural responses across subjects, we used representational similarity analysis (Brooks et al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Finn et al.,\u00a0 ; Sachs et al.,\u00a0 ) to assess to which degree neural and behavioral synchronization covaries. The analysis revealed that higher inter\u2010individual synchronization of engagement was underpinned by higher synchronization of neural responses within occipital and prefrontal regions (Figure\u00a0 ), specifically within the bilateral occipital fusiform gyrus (left OFG;  ; right OFG ( )), the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (left vmPFC:  ; right vmPFC:  ) and the right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) ( ; Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nInter\u2010subject representational similarity analysis results. Thresholded similarity maps for variations in subjective engagement and disengagement during sad (a) and neutral (b) movie clips. (a, top) Engagement. vmPFC, ventromedial prefrontal cortex; FG, fusiform gyrus; sgACC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. (a, bottom) Disengagement. dmPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; pgACC, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex; dACC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; TPJ, temporoparietal junction; vlPFC, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; slOC, superior lateral occipital cortex; Cd, caudate nucleus. (b, top) Engagement. ILOC, inferior lateral occipital cortex; AI, anterior insula; dACC; preCG, precentral gyrus; pCG, paracingulate gyrus; pSMG, posterior supramarginal gyrus; pgACC; perigenual cingulate cortex; sPL, superior parietal lobe. (b, bottom) No significant effects. The color bar illustrates the correlation distance ranging between 0 and 2, where values closer to zero reflect higher association between inter\u2010subject similarity in neural responses and inter\u2010subject similarity in subjective engagement and disengagement, respectively. Note that effects for engagement in the neutral condition arise mainly from negative correlations, resulting in higher correlation distance. ISC, inter\u2010subject correlation. \n  \nHigher inter\u2010individual synchronization of disengagement was underpinned by stronger synchronization of neural responses within brain regions mostly belonging to the DMN (Yeo et al.,  ), that is, the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) ( ), left vmPFC ( ), the left perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) ( ) and the left temporo\u2010parietal junction (TPJ) ( ; see Figure\u00a0 ). Further, effects with the same directionality were found in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) ( ) belonging to salience and somatomotor networks (Yeo et al.,  , the right dorso\u2010lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) belonging to the central executive network (CEN;  ;  , respectively), and the subcortical caudate nucleus ( ), and the superior lateral occipital cortex (slOC;  ; see Table\u00a0 ). \n\nFor the neutral movie, no significant effects were present for disengagement. For engagement, effects were derived negative correlation scores between synchronization in engagement and neural responses (Kriegeskorte et al.,\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). Given that positive correlations fulfill the expectations for similarity analyses required to perform RSA, interpreting negative associations has shown to be difficult. Here we follow the suggested interpretation by Dimsdale\u2010Zucker and Ranganath ( ) arguing that RSA with negative correlation scores reflects very low similarity between neural responses which is better represented when converting correlation scores to a distance metric. In contrast to our sad movie clip, the RSA for the neutral movie clip resulted mainly in negative correlations (except for the TPJ, slOC in disengagement) exacerbating the interpretation of the findings. Additionally, we observe by using the subjective continuous emotional intensity (without distinguishing between phases) the presence of significant regions exclusively associated with the sad movie (Table\u00a0 ), in contrast to the neutral film (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nAs an exploratory analysis, we extended the above outlined analyses treating groups of regions belonging to an individual search term from the Neurosynth database as one single brain parcel (see Section\u00a0 ). For the sad movie, regions commonly reported with the search term \u201csad\u201d were the only ones drawing on both emotional engagement ( ) and disengagement ( ; Figure\u00a0 ), where greater similarity in brain activity was related to similarity in both engagement and disengagement. For the remaining ROI groups identified with search terms, inter\u2010subject similarity in emotional engagement was positively associated with inter\u2010subject similarity in brain activity (\u201cauditory\u201d:  ; \u201carousal\u201d:  ; \u201cvisual perception\u201d:  ; \u201cawareness\u201d:   and \u201ccognitive emotional\u201d:  ; see Table\u00a0 ). For the search term \u201cemotional responses\u201d there was neither an association with engagement nor with disengagement. Permuted   p  \u2010values were thresholded with FDR (  p  \u2009=\u2009.05) across ROIs. For the neutral condition, no significant effects were found for brain parcels associated with the search terms (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nInter\u2010individual similarity of engagement and disengagement in relation to inter\u2010individual similarity in neural responses for brain regions belonging to search terms from the Neurosynth database. Significant correlations are marked with an asterisk ( ). ISC, inter\u2010subject correlation. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe used a sad and neutral movie clip with simultaneous continuous annotations of subjective emotional intensity to assess whether, and if so, to which degree individuals with similar emotional experiencing patterns recruit neural circuits similarly during movie watching. In particular, our hypothesis suggests that individuals vary in the tendency to respond to emotional material presented during movie watching, as reflected in varying patterns of onsets and duration of episodes of subjective engagement and disengagement. We sought to identify neural response patterns that synchronize together with the degree of inter\u2010individual alignment in subjective experiencing. Specifically, we hypothesized that increases and decreases in the timecourse of emotional intensity annotations could reflect the subjectively noticed beginning and end of episodes where individuals emotionally engaged and disengaged, respectively. To this aim, for every individual, we dichotomized the continuous subjective emotional intensity time courses into moments of engagement (present\/not present) and disengagement (present\/not present) by identifying time points when the signal rose or fell within intra\u2010individually defined thresholds. We wondered if engagement would be more similar or dissimilar across individuals compared to disengagement and if the degree of shared responses differs for sad compared to neutral content. During the sad movie clip, disengagement reports were significantly more aligned across individuals than engagement reports. In contrast, the neutral movie had less inter\u2010individual synchronization overall and did not significantly differentiate engagement and disengagement. One could speculate that more similarly experienced disengagement could reflect more similar usage of emotion regulation strategies, while noticed onsets of emotional engagement were more prone to subjective interpretability. However, further research is needed to investigate this. It has been hypothesized that the degree to which individuals resemble one another in their subjective affective experiencing is reflected in the degree to which they show a resemblance in their neural responses (Hasson et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Nummenmaa et al.,\u00a0 ), however, empirically their inter\u2010relation is poorly understood. For the sad movie clip, neural responses within the fusiform gyrus exhibited higher synchronization when engagement (but not when disengagement) was synchronized across individuals. This effect was absent for the neutral movie clip. The fusiform gyrus has been consistently found to be a face\u2010responsive region (Duchaine & Yovel,\u00a0 ; Kawasaki et al.,\u00a0 ; Liang et al.,\u00a0 ), especially when facial expressions were presented audio\u2010visually (Wild et al.,\u00a0 ), with higher activation for emotional than to neutral facial expressions (Apicella et al.,\u00a0 ). During movie viewing, it was previously shown that the fusiform gyrus exhibits the highest inter\u2010subject similarity across the entire brain network when faces versus non\u2010faces were shown (Hasson et al.,\u00a0 ). It is worth mentioning that the films were not quantitatively equated in terms of low\u2010level features such as faces. This introduces the potential for these differences to be attributed to factors beyond emotions. \n\nFor both engagement and disengagement, our synchronization analysis drew on the vmPFC. The vmPFC has been reported in many different contexts, including, autonomous arousal regulation (Tranel & Damasio,\u00a0 ; Zahn et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 ), negative affect generation with and without regulation (Etkin et al.,\u00a0 ; Winecoff et al.,\u00a0 ), self\u2010directed cognition (Northoff & Bermpohl,\u00a0 ). It is hypothesized that the vmPFC does not drive affective responses per se, but instead is crucial for transducing conceptual information to generate affective meaning to drive affective behavior (Roy et al.,\u00a0 ). In this regard, more synchronized engagement and disengagement reports together with more synchronized vmPFC responses could reflect that sad scenes within the movie were similarly contextualized across individuals, critical for determining whether or not a stimulus is subjectively experienced as emotionally arousing or not. \n\nDuring the sad movie clip, subjects were more similar in reporting moments of disengagement when compared to moments of engagement. One can only speculate if synchronized disengagement could reflect more similar use of emotion regulation strategies and if so, whether they are of a more explicit or automatic nature. It was previously shown that the induction of sadness results in more analytic strategies as compared to other negative emotions such as anger (Bodenhausen et al.,\u00a0 ). In this regard, it is possible that inter\u2010individual similarities in disengagement could have been driven by inter\u2010individual similarities in explicit emotion regulation strategy usage. Our neural findings support this: stronger alignments in disengagement across subjects related to more synchronized neural responses in frontally distributed regions belonging to the DMN, including the left vlPFC and vmPFC, and regions belonging to the central executive network, including the right dlPFC, and sections of the left dACC. These regions are typically involved when negative emotions are re\u2010appraised as compared to merely attended to without trying to alter the elicited feelings (Buhle et al.,\u00a0 ; Diekhof et al.,\u00a0 ; Kohn et al.,\u00a0 ; Ochsner et al.,\u00a0 ; for review see Etkin et al. ( )). Specifically, it was shown that brain stimulation\u2010induced increases in dlPFC excitability improved both the up and down\u2010regulation of negative emotions, and self\u2010reports indicated that this improved regulation was owed to successful re\u2010appraisal of negative emotions (Feeser et al.,\u00a0 ). Even though these studies did not investigate inter\u2010individual synchronization, these findings could potentially suggest that the frontal synchronization in our data reflects more inter\u2010individually similar employment of emotion regulation for coping with negative emotions. However, further research is needed to corroborate this assumption and investigate what type of strategies were employed. \n\nWe would like to highlight the sgACC and pgACC playing potentially critical complementary roles in the dynamics of emotion processing: related to synchronized engagement and disengagement, respectively. The sgACC drives changes in physiological arousal by predicting current or upcoming emotionally relevant events (Barrett & Simmons,\u00a0 ), sgACC metabolism has consistently predicted individual differences in plasma cortisol (Jahn et al.,\u00a0 ; Sullivan & Gratton,\u00a0 ) reflecting a high inter\u2010individual variability in autonomous arousal regulation (Dixon et al.,\u00a0 ). One could speculate that more inter\u2010individually synchronized engagement during movie watching could reflect more similar physiological arousal regulation as a result of more synchronized predictions about the emotional relevance of stimuli in the movie. The pgACC has previously been hypothesized to serve as a next relay for the context dependent self\u2010referenced evaluation of interoceptive sensations that were first autonomously processed by the sgACC (Lane et al.,\u00a0 ). Whereas the subgenual part of the ACC connects to regions of the autonomous arousal regions, the pregenual part connects with DMN regions such as vlPFC enabling the attribution of affective valence to subjective feeling states (Ernst et al.,\u00a0 ; Lane et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus, whereas synchronized sgACC processing during the sad movie could reflect similar arousal induction as a result of similar predictions of emotional relevance, pgACC synchronization could reflect self\u2010referenced evaluation of interoceptive sensations necessary for the initiation and incorporation of suitable explicit emotion regulation strategies. \n\nAs an exploratory analysis, we grouped brain regions based on their mutual involvement in studies associated with specific search terms in the Neurosynth database (sad, arousal, awareness, visual perception, emotional responses, cognitive emotional, auditory) ([ ], (Yarkoni et al.,\u00a0 )). When repeating the ISC\u2010RSA with these groups of brain regions as one entity, the neutral movie clip did not reveal a significant association between neural and behavioral synchronization. In contrast, for the sad movie clip, for almost all search term region groups there was a significant positive association with engagement synchronization. For instance, brain region groups for \u201carousal\u201d involving subcortical areas, for example, anterior insula (Critchley et al.,\u00a0 ), thalamus (Coull et al.,\u00a0 ); salience network (Critchley et al.,\u00a0 ) and DMN (Mourao\u2010Miranda et al.,\u00a0 ) synchronized together with engagement synchronization. The only group of brain regions that revealed both a positive association with engagement and disengagement belonged to the search term \u201csad\u201d (bilateral central and basolateral amygdala and the bilateral anterior insular cortex; Abou Elseoud et al.,\u00a0 ; Du et al.,\u00a0 ; Talati et al.,\u00a0 ; Yang et al.,\u00a0 ). In contrast, region groups belonging to the search term \u2018emotional response\u2019 involving the right dACC, the bilateral central amygdala and the bilateral anterior insula (Hare et al.,\u00a0 ; Zaki et al.,\u00a0 ) showed neither an association with engagement nor disengagement. Together these findings suggest a specificity of inter\u2010individually shared emotional activation and deactivation only for regions associated with sad emotion responses as opposed to emotional responses in general. \n\nThe present study relies on correlation analysis to understand the association between inter\u2010individual behavioral and neural response similarity. However, future work should also investigate the causal inter\u2010dependencies between neural signatures implicated in subjective emotional experience. For instance, Grosbras et al. ( ) found that strategic activation of the right posterior parietal cortex with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) enhanced the subjective positive rating of a dance performance recording, as compared to a control (vertex) stimulation (2012). Further, facilitating activation in the vmPFC with transcranial direct current stimulation, as compared to sham stimulation, resulted in reduced experienced emotional intensity together with greater activation within the vmPFC, sgACC, and ventral striatum during negative, but not neutral film viewing. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present movie\u2010viewing task design enabled us to induce a richer and emotionally more immersive experience as compared to traditional repeated stimulus\u2013response designs with static pictures, while at the same time mapping temporal alternations of emotional engagement and disengagement. This naturalistic task design comes at a cost: dynamic fluctuations in emotional experiencing can arise from multiple cognitive sources, in that different explicit or implicit regulation processes could have possibly led to one and the same emotional outcome. Additionally, our findings could be confounded by the mood the subjects were in before watching the movies. Future movie fMRI studies should use questionnaires on individuals' mood and arousal state. \n\nIn terms of the methodology, through the employment of a functionally oriented parcellation (Neurosyth atlas) discernible trade\u2010off emerges in terms of its hemispheric specificity. Despite our effort to divide it into two hemispheres, the resultant parcel distribution are uneven, being 60 parcels for the left hemisphere and 59 for the right hemisphere. This uneven allocation could be recognized as a limitation of the approach. \n\nThe inclusion of only female participants in the present study can be regarded as a drawback. Our decision to concentrate on female participants is grounded in our research goal of mitigating recognized gender\u2010related discrepancies in emotional processing (Fine et al.,\u00a0 ; Hofer et al.,\u00a0 ; Schulte\u2010R\u00fcther et al.,\u00a0 ). While this participant selection strategy might limit the broader applicability of our findings, we recognize the significance of incorporating a more comprehensive range of participants in forthcoming investigations. Additionally, we focused on the induction of sad (compared to neutral) emotions and further research is needed to assess the specificity of our results to each emotional category. Further, our movie clips were relatively short (10\u2009min in total, 5\u2009min each), and one could argue that the duration of the clips was too short to characterize emotion fluctuations, including the fact that engagement\/disengagement \u201con\u201d periods are only a fraction of the time course. However, our behavioral results show pronounced inter\u2010 and intra\u2010individually variable fluctuations, suggesting that there were sufficient data inducing fluctuations in emotion processing to investigate our research questions. Lastly, further research needs to replicate and extend these results to a larger sample. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nTaken together, the degree of inter\u2010individually shared emotional responses (as opposed to their individual magnitude) reveals neural signatures underlying affective processing and regulation in naturalistic paradigms. While the present work aimed at identifying the inter\u2010individual similarity of neural response patterns underlying inter\u2010individual similarity of subjective emotional response patterns, further research is needed to extend these findings for specific moments in time with dynamic ISC\u2010RSA approaches (e.g., Simony et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this article. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10964920,"text_md5":"b7df3aad17d2bd4d59fb3f5d449ede5c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,172],"journal":[173,187],"publication_year":[189,193],"title":[204,302],"keywords":[316,394],"abstract":[407,2762],"body":[2771,51697]},"batch":1,"pmid":38488450,"doi":"10.1002\/hbm.26622","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10964920","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10964920"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10964920\">10964920<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10964920  Neural signatures of shared subjective affective engagement and disengagement during movie viewing"}
