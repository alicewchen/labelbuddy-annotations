Moreover, we also included discussions on practices and research directions that validate fMRI studies in consumer neuroscience beyond data triangulation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince the dawn of consumer neuroscience, researchers have employed neuroimaging techniques, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to explore latent mental processes underlying consumer behavior (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Thanks to their collective effort through more than a decade of research, consumer neuroscientists have accumulated a wealth of insights that sheds light upon many aspects of consumer behavior. However, an unresolved challenge exists: that of reverse inference. Defined as the use of neuroimaging data to infer the presence of specific cognitive and affective processes ( ), reverse inference may be tricky when interpretating neuroimaging results ( ,  ;  ,  ). \n\nIn this article, we attempt to summarize potential issues associated with reverse inference, and we argue that proper data triangulation can help address these issues. Herein, we define data triangulation as the practice of utilizing multiple methods and data sources to study the same phenomenon ( ;  ). In neuroimaging research, triangulation would thus entail integrating neuroimaging data with data from meta-analyses, psychometric assessments, and consumer behavior. \n\nBecause the neuroimaging techniques employed in consumer neuroscience often consist of fMRI, we focus exclusively on fMRI research in our review of research papers, examinations of research methods, and recommendations to consumer researchers (hereinafter, we use the terms \u201cneuroimaging\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d synonymously). However, many of our analyses and recommendations could possibly be applied to other imaging techniques as well. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, we review more than 50 empirical articles employing fMRI techniques published in consumer and marketing research journals as well as neuroscience journals, and we use this review to discusses fMRI\u2019s contributions to consumer research. Second, we discuss two major interpretative approaches of neuroimaging research\u2014forward inference and reverse inference\u2014and explain how these approaches contribute to understanding consumer behavior. Third, we discuss potential issues and challenges associated with reverse inference. Fourth, we argue that the utilization of data triangulation of fMRI data with meta-analytic data as well as psychometric and behavioral data can enhance the validity of fMRI studies. Fifth, we provide and discuss several recommendations for future consumer neuroscience research. \n\n\n## Functional Neuroimaging in Consumer Research \n  \nOver the past one and a half decades, the field of consumer neuroscience has significantly contributed to consumer research. In  , we have reviewed and attempted to summarize more than 50 empirical articles utilizing fMRI techniques. The works summarized here have been published in consumer research journals such as the   Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science  , the   Journal of Consumer Research  , the   Journal of Marketing Research  , the   Journal of Consumer Psychology  , and the   Journal of the Association for Consumer Research  , as well as journals in fields outside consumer research, including psychology, neuroscience, and the general science. For journals outside consumer research, we have focused our review on   Cortex  ,   Journal of Neuroscience  ,   Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics, NeuroImage  ,   Neuron  ,   Psychological Science  , the   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  , and   Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience  , in which some of the earlier work on consumer neuroscience appeared and more recent work has continued to appear. For consumer research journals, the list of included works is based on research results for methodological keywords such as \u201cneuroimaging\u201d and \u201cfMRI.\u201d For journals outside consumer research, the list of included works is focused on fMRI studies generated from searching keywords such as \u201cconsumer neuroscience,\u201d \u201cneuromarketing,\u201d \u201cmarket,\u201d \u201cmarketing,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d and \u201cpurchase.\u201d Given our focus on specific journals and keywords, we acknowledge that some works related to consumer neuroscience may not be included in this review. Additionally, since our article\u2019s focus is on fMRI, we would like to note that important work has been done using other imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Nevertheless, the works included in   cover a broad range of topics relevant to consumer researchers, including theoretical domains such as information processing ( ;  ), judgment and decision making ( ;  ), and goals and motivation ( ;  ), as well as substantive domains such as advertising ( ;  ;  ), pricing ( ;  ), branding ( ,  ;  ), and packaging design ( ). The table also examines the papers\u2019 usage of meta-analyses as well as psychometrics/behavioral data, two major data source that we recommend triangulating with the fMRI data. Taken together,   provides a summary of the status of the consumer neuroscience literature and the type of data being used, showing that over the past one and a half decades researchers have started to integrate different data forms in their investigations. \n  \nConsumer neuroscience research in marketing, consumer research, and neuroscience journals (chronological order). \n    \n\n## Approaches for the Interpretation of Consumer Neuroscience Data: Forward Versus Reverse Inference \n  \nAccording to  , neuroimaging studies take at least two major interpretative approaches. The first approach examines the neuroanatomical localization of behaviors and mental tasks, a process often referred to as   forward inference   ( ;  ). Forward inference has been adopted in consumer neuroscience to investigate the neurophysiological substrates of a wide range of consumer research concepts including, but not limited to, valuation ( ), social influence of buying decisions ( ), perception of money ( ), and consumer curiosity ( ). A typical forward inference question is this: While the concept of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for a product is not unfamiliar to consumer researchers, where is WTP encoded in the brain?   attempted to answer this interesting question by having hungry participants bid for the right to eat food. The authors pinpointed the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as encoding locations of WTP. While the forward inference approach is laudable, it does not come without limitations. One such limitation is that while forward inference may highlight that a particular consumer research concept is correlated with activation of a certain brain area, forward inference often leaves open the psychological interpretation of possible underlying processes at play. This limitation may be less problematic in research that is largely interested in brain mapping but becomes more challenging in research that also cares about underlying psychological processes. \n\nThe second major approach of neuroimaging research involves using brain activation patterns to infer psychological processes. Specifically, by building on previously established functions and/or connectivity of specific brain regions, consumer researchers can make educated guesses as to which cognitive and emotional processes may be taking place as consumers process information or make decisions. This process is known as   reverse inference   ( ,  ). For instance, if a researcher posits that visual processing is taking place in an fMRI study because of increased activation in the occipital lobe, the researcher is reverse inferencing. \n\nReverse inference is important for consumer research (and for neuroscience in general) because it allows consumer researchers to access implicit or latent physiological processes ( ;  ). Specifically, the reverse inference approach can contribute to consumer research in at least three ways, as discussed below. \n\nThe first and most direct application of this research approach is that it allows consumer researchers to allude to underlying implicit psychological processes by observing activities of specific brain regions. This application requires a previously established link between brain regions and their functions. For instance, in studying how consumers process aesthetic package design,   recorded participants\u2019 brain activity as they viewed aesthetic (vs. standardized) product package designs using fMRI. The authors observed that when processing aesthetic (vs. standardized) package designs, participants\u2019 brains featured greater activation in the striatum, a brain area that has been associated with reward evaluations and processing ( ;  ;  ;  ), among other activations. Following a similar interpretative logic,   found that increasing the price of wine increases both reports of pleasantness as well as activity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a brain area that has widely been thought to encode pleasantness. \n\nSecond, neuroimaging can aid consumer researchers when competing theories exist to explain an observed phenomenon. Specifically, researchers have relied on established theories of brain regions\u2019 functions to determine which theory is (or theories are) supported by actual brain activation. One such paper is   seminal examination of self-control depletion. Building on a two-stage model of self-control (i.e., recognizing the need for self-control \u2192 implementing self-control), the authors examined three completing models of depletion: (1) depletion only impairs the ability to recognize the need for self-control, (2) depletion only impairs the ability to implement self-control, and (3) depletion impairs both abilities. An fMRI study demonstrated that under depletion, a brain region associated with the implementation of controlled action (i.e., the right middle frontal gyrus located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) features reduced activation, but such patterns were not found in the brain region associated with the detection of goal conflict (i.e., the anterior cingulate cortex). Therefore, the authors were able to conclude that only the implementation stage was likely to be affected by depletion ( ). \n\nThird, the reverse inference approach is also useful in distinguishing different processes, networks, or stages of processing (i.e., neurophysiological dissociation). Such studies usually involve the observation of activations in different brain functional regions and/or networks (and occasionally also at different times) when participants undertake different cognitive tasks. For instance,   investigated whether semantic judgments of brands and humans are processed similarly. It has long been observed that consumers, marketers, and researchers alike tend to use similar if not identical words to describe both brands and people ( ;  ;  ). For instance, a brand can be \u201creliable\u201d like a person and can form relationships with humans as other humans do. This tendency naturally raises the question of whether brands and humans are processed identically or at least similarly in the human brain.   work, however, showed that this may not be the case: Processing humans was associated with the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas processing brands was associated with the left inferior prefrontal cortex, which has been found to be involved in object processing. \n\nIn summary, neuroimaging studies often take two major interpretative approaches: Using both behaviors and mental tasks to explore neurophysiological correlates and to map the brain (i.e., forward inference) and using brain activations to infer certain psychological processes (i.e., reverse inference). With reverse inference, we have further identified three ways in which reverse inference contributes to consumer research: (1) determining underlying, implicit, and unknown psychological processes; (2) determining the plausibility of enhancing and/or completing theories; and (3) distinguishing multiple processes, networks, or stages of processing. Both approaches are of great value and are widely employed in consumer neuroscience and neuroscience in general. In the present paper, we focus on reverse inference due to its theoretical and methodological intricacies and highlight its potential issues when employed. \n\n\n## Potential Issues Associated With Reverse Inference \n  \nAlthough reverse inference is by no means an incorrect research approach   per se   ( ), neuroscientists have noticed interpretational issues associated with it ( ;  ). More specifically, when activation in a brain region of interest is not particularly selective for a specific cognitive process (i.e., when multiple cognitive processes can activate the same brain region), the validity of reverse inference can be undermined ( ,  ). \n\nFor instance, it has long been known that the anterior cingulate cortex is heavily involved in the processing of conflicting information from the environment ( ;  ;  ), so it is tempting to assume that the consumer brain is processing conflicting information when activation in this brain region is observed. However, prior literature shows that the anterior cingulate cortex is also sensitive to the gain and loss of rewards (e.g.,  ;  ). As a result, researchers cannot, without committing a logical fallacy, argue for the involvement of conflicting information based on the activation observed in the anterior cingulate cortex alone. \n\nUnfortunately, multi-functional brain regions are quite common (e.g.,  ;  ). As a result, issues associated with reverse inference are neither foreign to consumer neuroscience nor foreign to neuroscience in general. Indeed, in the recent consumer neuroscience literature, the medial prefrontal cortex has been associated with reward processing ( ;  ), pleasantness ( ), self-referential evaluation of preferences ( ), and social processes ( ;  ). While the exact three-dimensional locations of the medial prefrontal cortex may slightly vary across these investigations, they generally belong to the same anatomical brain area. Similarly, activation in the insula has been claimed to indicate negative affect status ( ), social influence ( ), and desire for rewards ( ). \n\nWhat, then, can and should consumer researchers do to address this issue? Below, we will focus on three major strategies that can mitigate potential issues inherent in reverse inference: (1) reducing false alarms via refined study design and analysis, (2) employing neuroimaging meta-analyses to estimate the extent of reverse inference, and (3) integrating neuroimaging data with psychometric assessments and data from behavioral studies to provide additional confidence in the findings. We also posit that data triangulation employing these methods may greatly enhance the validity of neuroimaging research. \n\n\n## Addressing Potential Issues Associated With Reverse Inference \n  \nTo address the potential issues associated with reverse inference, we first explain its logic. Let   COG   be the cognitive process of interest, and let   ACT   be the activation in the brain region purportedly associated with this process. The validity of reverse inference is thus given by the probability that   COG   takes place given that   ACT   is present, or, formally,   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). According to Bayes\u2019 theorem: \n\nIt should be noted that the term   COG   here is always conditioned on the specific task used in the studies. In other words, the prior probability of   P  (  C   O   G  ) in this equation should in fact be P(  C   O   G  |  T   A   S   K  ), where   TASK   stands for the task setting and design. We have omitted this term in the equation for the sake of succinctness, but we will revisit this task-relevant nature of reverse inference in later discussions. \n\nThe equation above translates the question of reverse inference into \u201cWhen the activation of specific brain regions is observed, how likely is it that the cognitive process of interest indeed took place?\u201d To be able to make any meaningful argument based on such reverse inference, consumer researchers need to estimate and, if possible, systematically increase the value of   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). This can be done in multiple ways, as summarized below. \n\n### Reducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis \n  \nActivations in a brain region that (1) is purportedly associated with a cognitive process of interest but (2) does not actually reflect the proposed cognitive are called   false alarms  , which is a major culprit of reverse inference\u2019s validity issues ( ). Mathematically, the denominator in the above equation,   P  (  A   C   T  ), is the prior probability that indicates the tendency of this brain region to become activated   by default  . If a brain region can easily become activated (i.e., if the false alarm rate is high) \u2013 because, for instance, it is involved in many different cognitive processes \u2013 then   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  )will be relevantly small because   P  (  A   C   T  ) is large, rendering reverse inference invalid. \n\nAlthough how easily a brain region can become active and in how many different functions a brain region can get involved are questions largely beyond consumer researchers\u2019 control, methods exist to control the level of   P  (  A   C   T  ). \n\nFirst, consumer researchers could design studies in such a way that the chances of false alarms are reduced. To illustrate, the term   P  (  A   C   T  ) in the equation of Bayes\u2019 Theorem can be further broken down to   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  )  P  (  C   O   G  ) +   P  (  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  )  P  (\u00ac  C   O   G  ); thus, \n\nwhere \u00ac  C   O   G   indicates that the cognitive process of interest is not present. \n\nAccording to this equation, if a brain region can be activated by a mental process different from the one of interest (i.e., the false alarm, the probability of which is captured by   P  [  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  ]), then the validity of reverse inference   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) will decrease as a result (all else being equal). Conversely, if, based on the systematic review of prior literature and study design, consumer researchers can lessen the possibility that such alternative cognitive processes take place, then the term   P  (  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  )  P  (\u00ac  C   O   G  )] should shrink in value, and, as a result, the validity of reverse inference will increase. For instance, in a thought experiment,   discusses an experiment that infers the recognition of visual words from activation of the fusiform gyrus. Because the imagery study only involves the presentation of words, consumer researchers can reasonably rule out the competing cognitive theory of facial recognition. In this way, although the fusiform gyrus is multifunctional, the study design creates functional specificity by eliminating an alternative theory and, thus, controlling the baseline level of   P  (  A   C   T  ), which is in fact   P  (  A   C   T  |  T   A   S   K  ). Needless to say, ruling out alternative cognitive processes via design requires a good understanding of the literature on the brain region(s) of interest and depends heavily upon how much is known about the functionality of the brain region (cf.  ). \n\nAnother way to reduce false alarms is to use finer (i.e., smaller and/or better-defined) structures for reverse inference. Smaller ROIs are more selective and, thus, more predictive of cognitive processes than larger regions ( ). In addition, instead of relying on the activation of individual brain regions, consumer researchers could use patterns of such activations to decode underlying cognitive processes, a method called multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). This method utilizes pattern recognition to identify connections between cognitive processes and neuroimaging activation patterns. Such connections can then be used to reduce false alarms, as holistic activation patterns are much more selective for specific cognitive processes than individual brain regions are ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Integrating Information From Neuroimaging Meta-Analyses \n  \nWhy can meta-analyses help validate reverse inference? To answer this question, we must first discuss two important notions that are pertinent to reverse inference: consistency and specificity ( ).   Consistency   is the extent to which brain activations replicate across studies, scanners, and labs, when certain cognitive processes are engaged. For instance, when participants see fear-inducing stimuli in a scanner, do their amygdalae tend to become activated regardless of where and in which labs they are scanned, who is scanning them, and how fear is induced in these scans? If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then the amygdala can be assumed to be consistently associated with fear. In the equation above, consistency is captured by   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  ), which is in proportion to   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). In other words, if consistency is inflated, then the evaluation of reverse inference will also be inflated, causing a validity issue. Unfortunately, in neuroimaging studies,   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  ) does tend to be inflated, because the usually small sample sizes and large numbers of tests give rise to underpowered studies and high false positive rates ( ;  ). As a result, to evaluate the validity of reverse inference, consistency must be accounted for. On the other hand,   specificity   captures whether a brain region is selective for a mental process, which is directly associated with the validity of reverse inference as discussed in section \u201cReducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis.\u201d \n\nTherefore, to estimate   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) and assess the validity of reverse inference, it is crucial to estimate consistency and specificity. However, neither feature can be acquired from a single study. Rather, one must consult a substantial number of studies to make a good estimation of consistency and specificity and, in turn, the validity of reverse inference. \n\nNeuroimaging databases, such as   ( ), attempt to provide a means to account for consistency and specificity based on prior neuroimaging literature and meta-analyses generated using the database. Such databases thus attempt to quantify the extent of reverse inference by estimating the posterior probability   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ).   claims to be an open-source, large-scale, automated synthesis of functional neuroimaging data, utilizing text-mining and meta-analytic techniques to synthesize more than 14,000 published research papers (as of June 2020) and providing probabilistic mappings between brain regions and terms. These terms describe cognitive states (e.g., \u201cpain,\u201d \u201cworking memory,\u201d or \u201cfear\u201d) and are used in the abstract of a paper, so they serve as a proxy of the mental process of interest. Based on this database and the meta-analysis provided therein, consumer researchers are able to tell whether there tends to be a non-zero association between the usages of certain terms (e.g., \u201cemotion\u201d) and the activation of a given brain region (e.g., the amygdala) in the extant literature. More importantly, the database also provides the posterior probability of a term, if the activation of a specific brain region is found (i.e., an estimated   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) based on extant literature). \n\nTo illustrate the usefulness and usage of meta-analysis, imagine that a consumer researcher is interested in how product evaluation can be influenced by the physical attractiveness of photos of human models that appear on product packages. Let us further assume after a literature review, the researcher hypothesizes that highly attractive models are more rewarding than average-looking models and thus lead to more favorable product evaluation. Since the reward valuation of physical attractiveness is associated with activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ), the researcher chooses the ventromedial prefrontal cortex as the ROI that reflects reward processing in this hypothesis. [Note, however, that in this scenario we focus on a single brain region only to make the example as simple as possible. In reality, it is always advisable to expect more than one ROI to be activated and, as a result, to (1) always include a whole brain analyses under the proper family-wise error rate (FWER)/false discovery rate (FDR) threshold (i.e., techniques to control false positives in fMRI data analysis, see  ) and/or (2) investigate brain regions in their activation patterns rather than in isolation, for instance employing MVPA as discussed in Section \u201cReducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis\u201d]. \n\nThe researcher then sets out to test the hypothesis with fMRI, in which participants are shown a battery of product packages with images of either highly attractive models or average-looking models on them. Consistent with the hypothesis, when viewing packages with highly attractive (vs. average-looking) models, participants exhibit a brain activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in a region of interest with the center being the MNI coordinates   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216. Also consistent with the hypothesis, the BOLD signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediates the liking of the product reported by in-scanner button pressing. \n\nBased on these results, it would seem that the hypothesis is supported by the fMRI result. However, is this truly the case? Can the researcher reasonably infer reward processing from this brain activation, understanding the risks of reverse inference, especially regarding such notoriously multifunctional regions as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex? \n\nTo answer this question, the researcher needs to estimate   P  (  R   e   w   a   r   d   P   r   o   c   e   s   s   i   n   g  |  v   m   P   F   C   a   c   t   i   v   a   t   i   o   n   i   n   a   n   d   a   r   o   u   n   d  [\u22124,38,\u221216]), which indicates how much confidence the researcher can put in this reverse inference.   is designed precisely to quantify such reverse inferences. After inputting the coordinates of the peak voxel activation in  , it generates a table under the \u201cAssociations\u201d tab (see  ) based on its meta-analytical data corpus. Clearly, some terms in the table are brain regions (e.g., \u201cventromedial,\u201d \u201cvmpfc\u201d), while others are cognitive processes (e.g., \u201cterms,\u201d \u201cdecision,\u201d \u201cchoice\u201d). \n  \nMeta-analysis results generated by   (retrieved on June 26, 2020). \n  \nNot surprisingly, the term \u201creward\u201d (highlighted in  ) appears in the association table. For this term of interest, the meta-analysis first returns a   z  -score of 5.39. This z-score shows whether there exists a non-zero relationship between the term (\u201creward\u201d in this case) and the location (i.e.,   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216). The larger the z-score, the more confidence the researcher can have in claiming that this brain location is indeed associated with reward in the extant literature. Note that this z-score, however,   cannot   be used to determine the validity of the reverse inference being employed,   nor   can it be used to infer the strength of the association between the mental process (i.e., the term) and the location of the activation in the brain ( ). \n\nMore informative is the number under the \u201cposterior prob.\u201d column. This number is the estimation of   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) and, thus, of the validity of the reverse inference. In our case, the posterior probability is 0.7 (see  ). However, what does this number mean? Note that Bayes\u2019 Theorem dictates that posterior probabilities must be calculated based on prior probabilities. In the case of  , its creators arbitrarily impose a uniform 50% prior probability on   all   terms [  P  (  C   O   G  ) = \u20040.5  for   any   C   O   G  ]. In other words,   assumes that if we take a random paper in the database, the prior probability of that paper using   any   term is exactly 50%. This is, of course, not true in reality; however, by making this assumption,   provides a threshold that applies to   all   terms, such that if the posterior probability is greater than 0.5, then the researcher can reasonably assume that the reverse inference he or she is examining has some merit at an above-chance level ( ;  ). In addition, this uniform, arbitrary 0.5 prior probability allows researchers to make quantitative comparisons across all terms, such that if a location has a greater posterior probability for a term, then this region is more preferentially associated with that term than are the terms with lower posterior probabilities. It should be noted, however, that if the arbitrary prior probability is changed to other values from 0.5, the posterior probability will also vary as a result. Therefore, the absolute value of the posterior probability does not carry much meaning   per se  , and interpretations thereof should be made only in relation to other probabilities, such as the default 0.5, or the posterior probability for a different term associated with the same voxel. \n\nTherefore, in our case, the 0.7 posterior probability means that if there is a 50\u201350 chance that a study uses the term \u201creward\u201d   a priori  , then the estimated posterior probability for the term \u201creward\u201d to be used increases to 70% after we observe the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in and around MNI coordinates   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216. Thus, it seems that there is an above-chance likelihood that reward process is present in this hypothetical study. Please note again that one can only interpret change (i.e., 0.7 vs. the baseline 0.5) and not the absolute value. \n\nHowever, we should take care here to avoid jumping to conclusions. It is very important to note that the fact that there is a decent chance of reward processing having taken place given the observed activation does not necessarily mean that this region is   selective   for reward. Rather, other terms may also have comparable or even higher levels of posterior probability in this reported region. Indeed, if we pay close attention to other terms in  , terms such as \u201cautobiographical memory\u201d and \u201cmentalizing\u201d (both highlighted) will arise, each having a posterior probability even greater than that of \u201creward\u201d (0.84 and 0.79, respectively). Admittedly, many terms with the highest posterior probabilities in this table are reward-related (e.g., \u201creward,\u201d \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201cmoney\u201d). However, even after taking all these terms into consideration, the conclusion the researcher can draw from this meta-analysis is still inconclusive; that is, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in and around (  x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216) is preferentially (but not selectively) associated with reward. In other words, at this point in the analysis, we are still not sure if reward processing is truly happening. \n\nThus far, we have discussed what the   database tells us and, equally importantly, what it does   not   tell us (also cf.  ,  for a discussion). The most important question, however, still remains. The researcher in our hypothetical example theorizes that reward is underlying the processing of product packages with images of highly attractive (vs. average-looking) human models on them. The fMRI result seems to support this argument, and the meta-analysis suggests that there is a good chance that the researcher is on the right track. However, the researcher still cannot draw decisive conclusions, due to the existence of alternative, equally viable (at least judging from the meta-analysis) mental processes (in this case, autobiographical memory and mentalizing). So, what should the researcher do now? \n\nThis question can be partially addressed by the meta-analysis that brings up this very question. Indeed, a valuable function of meta-analysis is to identify a (limited) set of competing theories so the proposed hypothesis can be supported by eliminating other (at least major) alternatives. Needless to say, the easiest alternatives to exclude are those that are unlikely to occur under the particular study design being employed. For instance, in the design of the hypothetical study described above, autobiographical memory is very unlikely to have been involved (since there is not a memory-related task involved) and thus can be reasonably excluded. \n\nHowever, mentalizing \u2013 the process by which individuals make sense of the mental state of others or oneself \u2013 may well survive this \u201cexclusion by study design.\u201d After all, when consumers see other human beings (i.e., human models used in our hypothetical fMRI experiment), especially if they show emotions, consumers may well engage in mentalizing and, in turn, feature the well-documented activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ;  ). At this point, the researcher needs to think above and beyond the meta-analysis. One possible solution, for example, is to acquire the activation pattern of mentalizing; if this pattern is inconsistent with the actual results, then it is very likely that mentalizing may not have taken place. In this case, mentalizing involves not only the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex but also activity in the precuneus and/or the temporoparietal junction, which often accompany ventromedial activations. Thus, if the researcher fails to find meaningful activations in these additional regions, mentalizing may not have been engaged in the study. Needless to say, the researcher should turn to extant literature to identify such patterns; however, another newly launched meta-analysis database,  , may also greatly assist in this process, in that it helps researchers predict which brain regions are likely to become activated given designated cognitive processes. Moreover, pattern-based activation can prove useful even if mentalizing does take place. For instance, if reward processing indeed occurs, it may not only involve the ventromedial prefrontal cortex but also trigger the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum. If the researcher can find activity in these regions that are also involved in reward processing, it becomes more evident that reward is taking place, even in the presence of mentalizing. \n\nAlthough meta-analyses can shed important light upon the validity of reverse inference, it is not without limitations. Other than the information meta-analysis cannot yield, which we already discussed in Section \u201cIntegrating Information from Neuroimaging Meta-Analyses,\u201d there exist other factors that limit the usefulness of meta-analyses. \n\nFirst, when the term related to the cognitive process of interest has been rarely examined in the literature, the database will provide little information to the researcher. For instance, consumer researchers interested in personal control may recognize the scantiness of neuroimaging studies investigating perceived control and loss thereof, despite the richness of non-imaging work, which has been conducted mostly on non-human animals (e.g.,  ;  ,  ). \n\nSecond, when a term is used inconsistently in the literature, the usefulness of meta-analysis is also limited. For instance, in the literature, the term \u201ccontrol\u201d not only is used to refer to \u201cpersonal control\u201d but also is found in works involving self-control, motor control, executive control, and even the control condition in experimental studies. These terms are not distinguishable in the database due to the limitation of text-recognition tools, thus rendering meta-analyses on such terms virtually uninformative. \n\nThird, meta-analysis databases like   cannot capture nuances across studies and designs. Such situations may introduce noise to meta-analyses and thus undermine the usefulness of their results, except in the case of well-defined and consistently-used cognitive processes and experimental procedures ( ). \n\nFor instance, meta-analysis databases may not be able to distinguish between \u201cperceptual curiosity\u201d and \u201cepistemic curiosity,\u201d as the terms tend to be aggregated together, despite their conceptual and neurophysiological distinctions in the literature on curiosity ( ;  ;  ;  ). To make matters worse, there are too few neuroimaging studies on curiosity to provide sufficient statistical power for the meta-analysis, if such terms exist in the database at all. Moreover, the inconsistent study procedures introduce noise to the database. Thus, if a researcher hypothesizes perceptual (but not epistemic) curiosity as the cognitive process underlying a certain consumer behavior, meta-analysis might not be able to provide much useful insight. In the following section, we argue that behavioral data can prove useful in addressing these concerns. \n\nIn addition, another database,   ( ), has recently been made publicly available.  This new database complements the previously discussed databases in important ways, which we discuss below. An issue with the traditional databases is that the results they generate are largely based on decontextualized, aggregated data and arbitrary thresholding. Specifically, such databases rely on automated text-analysis algorithms and scripts to analyze and document the neuroscience concepts (in the form of \u201cterms\u201d) included in a sizable corpus of literature with considerable statistic power. However, to investigate these neuroscience concepts, the original research papers included in the corpus may take different approaches, employ different designs, and use different terms. Due to current limitations of text-mining techniques, traditional databases are unable to capture such task-related information, nuances across studies and designs, and idiosyncratic usages of the same terms. This situation can prove problematic, because the output of such analysis can suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and thus can be difficult to control and interpret, except in the case of well-defined concepts and/or highly standardized procedures ( ).  , on the other hand, attempts to employ a different approach. Specifically,   begins with keywords (e.g., psychological processes, neuropsychological conditions, and anatomy) and uses these terms to predict what brain regions are likely to become activated if proposed psychological processes are engaged. The model this database utilizes can produce accurate and usable predictions of ROIs even for less common terms, terms that are named inconsistently in neuroscience vocabulary, or sets of terms that have not been studied together previously. \n\n\n### Integrating Psychometric and Behavioral Data \n  \nAlthough many researchers turn to neuroimaging techniques to discover mental processes precisely because of behavioral studies\u2019 limitations, psychometric and behavioral data are useful in neuroimaging studies in many ways. To begin with, in relation to our discussions on meta-analyses, psychometric and behavioral data can prove helpful in compensating the shortcomings of meta-analyses, as they can provide a better-calibrated, task-relevant environment to investigate psychological processes of interest. In the aforementioned case of curiosity, for instance, extant literature provides rich behavioral manipulations to introduce perceptual vs. epistemic curiosity (e.g.,  ), and the researcher can thus conduct behavioral experiments to observe whether perceptual (but not epistemic) curiosity produces the consumer behavior in question. If so, such studies can provide more evidence to complement the fMRI data. \n\nEven when meta-analyses can be employed without the issues discussed in the previous section, psychometric and behavioral data can still prove helpful to reverse inference studies by provide additional evidence that the proposed cognitive process is indeed implicated in the phenomenon being studied. Mathematically, doing so increases   P  (  C   O   G  ) and in turn   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). For instance,   investigate the consumer responsiveness to the \u201cmarketing placebo effects\u201d (MPE; the effect by which consumption experience and subsequent behavior are influenced by marketing-based expectancy such price, quality beliefs, etc.). The authors provide a comprehensive account of the cognitive processes that can influence MPE: reward responsiveness, cognitive top-down processing, and somatosensory bottom-up processing. In an MRI study, the gray matter volume of brain regions associated with these cognitive processes is found to be predictive of the MPE effect. To provide further support for this theoretical account, the authors further conducted a study demonstrating that personality traits related to these cognitive processes are also predictive of MPE, as are gray matter volume measures, thus fostering extra confidence in the proposed processes. \n\nNote that for triangulation purposes, the behavioral data do not need to be \u201cpurely behavioral\u201d (i.e., collected from separate studies that do not feature neuroimaging elements at all). Rather, the collection of psychometric and behavioral data can either be part of the original fMRI study and/or collected in separate studies. \n\nFor instance, imagine a study investigating how food print ads drive consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase. To explore the cognitive process underlying food ads, suppose the researcher shows hungry participants multiple food ad images in the scanner as they report how much they want to purchase the food advertised. Let us further assume that the researcher finds that more successful ads are associated with (1) a neural network associated with reward and impulse (which might include, say, the nucleus accumbens, orbital prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, etc.) and (2) importantly, reduced activation in the medial prefrontal gyrus, a region associated with inhibition behavior (e.g.,  ). Based on this pattern, our hypothetical researcher speculates that more successful food ads might be associated with greater inhibition/control failure and, in turn, higher willingness to purchase. (Here again, we caution our readers that the theorization and selection of ROIs herein are overly simplified for the sake of clarity and succinctness). \n\nThis theorizing is clearly an example of potentially problematic reverse inferences. How, then, can behavioral data help the researcher with this proposed process? Of course, the aforementioned \u201cpurely behavioral\u201d studies can be conducted, wherein the researcher shows that depleted participants exhibit greater willingness to purchase to the same food ad than non-depleted participants do, thus demonstrating the involvement of control process. Alternatively, the researcher could show that people\u2019s acceptance of the same food ad is a function of their trait self-control. However, the researchers can also collect behavioral data and combine them with neuroimaging data collected in either the existing or a new study to provide support for the proposed hypothesis. \n\nFor instance, if inhibition/control indeed plays a role in the acceptance of food ads, the aggregated activation in related brain regions acquired from a group as small as the participants scanned may be predictive of the effectiveness of the ads in the real world on a market or population level (i.e., neuroforecasting,  ). Such \u201crelated brain regions\u201d may be the medial prefrontal gyrus found in the existing hypothetical study or may involve a more extensive inhibitory network established by the literature. Similarly, the researcher could also run a structural scan to see whether the cortical thickness of these brain regions is predictive of individual participants\u2019 acceptance of the ads (e.g., rating, choice, etc.). Furthermore, the researcher can even use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt the function in these brain regions (if they are relative shallow) or recruit participants with lesions in these areas and obverse how these participants react to the ads in comparison to control participants. In all these approaches, behavioral data are combined with brain data to shed light upon the underlying cognitive processes \u2013 in this case, inhibition and control. \n\nAs shown above, psychometric and behavioral data can be triangulated with brain data in a very flexible manner and can provide interesting and useful insights to researchers in many ways. Based on the specific issues they are investigating, the nature of the existing design and data, and the technology and resources available to them, researchers can select approaches to behavioral data to fit their needs. \n\n\n### Summary: The Importance of Triangulation \n  \nIn summary, in consumer neuroscience, researchers can address the validity issue of reverse inference by (1) refining the neuroimaging study design and analysis to reduce false alarms, (2) utilizing neuroimaging databases and the meta-analysis data therein to quantify the extent of reverse inference, and (3) using psychometric and behavioral data to provide additional process evidence. \n\nIn this paper, we advocate not the isolated employment but the triangulation of these methods. Such triangulation can enable each method to compensate for the others\u2019 shortcomings and disadvantages, thus providing synergy toward improved overall validity. As discussed earlier, notwithstanding their unique advantages, each of these methods suffers from certain shortcomings: fMRI studies can investigate hidden mental processes but are potentially vulnerable to reverse inference issues; neuroimaging meta-analysis can assist researchers in quantifying reverse inference, but its usability can be limited and its analysis may not necessarily be conclusive; and behavioral data are flexible and can be well calibrated to the stimuli and procedures but may not be able to address the mental process of interest in a direct manner (the very reason researchers turn to neuroimaging in the first place). \n\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of each method is important, as the cons serve as a starting point to identify the potential validity issues with one\u2019s data, while the pros help researchers understand what data triangulations should be employed to address these issues. Indeed, this is precisely what the literature on Multitrait-Multimethod Matrices (MTMM,  ;  ) suggests: that is, a single method may not be enough to distinguish the cognitive process of interest from unsubstantial, random-method variance and noise and, instead, multiple methods taking different angles can possibly redress single-method concern effectively. \n\nTherefore, despite the increased time, effort, and expertise needed to adopt a multi-method approach, we still believe that the triangulation approach we have proposed herein should be considered by consumer neuroscience researchers. Specifically, for neuroimaging studies in consumer neuroscience, we believe the researcher should always (1) carefully refine the design of the fMRI study and (2) utilize meta-analyses (of course, sometimes the database is not usable for certain keywords and designs, but this is not known to the researcher until they have utilized the database). On the other hand, we believe that the researcher should base their decision of whether to include (3) psychometric and behavioral data, as well as what to include, on the specific issue they are facing. If, for example, the researcher makes a claim about certain mental cognitive processes based on brain activation, but the subsequent study design and meta-analysis cannot rule out competing theories and provide conclusive judgments, we would then recommend that psychometric and behavioral data be included. However, if it is already well-established in the behavioral literature that treatment X (e.g., seeing a picture of a snake) will cause mental activity M (e.g., fear) in the population of interest, and if, with due caution and prudence, the researcher can reasonably believe there is no good reason why this causal link would disappear in the scanner, then perhaps in such a case the researcher does not need to reinvent the wheel. Therefore, much as we applaud the merit of psychometric and behavioral data in general and believe they are beneficial most of the time, as a general principle we encourage researchers to include meaningful psychometric and behavioral data that address existing issues stemming from their particular research question and design, instead of triangulating for the sake of triangulating. \n\nIn addition to the hypothetical examples we used in previous sections, real-world examples of triangulation can also be found in the extant literature in consumer neuroscience. Regarding the works we summarized in  , in Section \u201cIntegrating Psychometric and Behavioral Data,\u201d we already discussed how   triangulated anatomical neuroimaging data with psychometric measures to explore the marketing placebo effect, and we would like to note that in this work the authors also utilize the NeuroSynth meta-analytical tool in support of their conclusions. Similarly, in  , an fMRI study demonstrates that brand betrayal and brand satisfaction involve different brain areas. This result is triangulated with both psychometric measures and the NeuroSynth database. The authors were able to pinpoint a number of aspects on which brand dissatisfaction is differentiated from brand betrayal, including prior relationship with the brand, anger, and rumination. Furthermore, by combining fMRI, individual-level data and marketing-level behavioral data,   found that nucleus accumbens activity not only predicts individual choices to fund in crowdfunding but also market-level funding outcome. The authors also examined the role sensory processes play in the identified pattern, and NeuroSynth was employed to predefine the volumes of interest (VOIs). \n\n\n\n## Future Directions in Consumer Neuroscience \n  \nIn addition to data triangulation, other practices can also improve the validity of individual studies and consumer neuroscience. Although a thorough discussion of these practices would be outside the scope of this paper, we would still like to take this opportunity to briefly advocate some of these practices for future studies in the field. \n\n### Toward a Quantification of Triangulation \n  \nAs discussed in Section \u201cSummary: The Importance of Triangulation,\u201d the notion of data triangulation proposed in this paper is consistent with that of the Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix (MTMM,  ). The MTMM provides useful information that can benefit fMRI studies in three ways. First, the MTMM provides estimations of reliability of each measure, which could potentially help address the issue that fMRI measures tend to suffer from poor overall reliability ( ). Second, the MTMM provides assessment of convergent validity: if a concept (e.g., a mental process) is measured through multiple methods, the measures should be strongly correlated. Third, the MTMM also helps researchers to establish discriminant (or divergent) of measures, such that measures for different constructs should not be correlated ( ). \n\nTherefore, the MTMM would be a good tool to evaluate how well the triangulation improves the validity. The challenge is, however, how to directly compare the vastly different methods (e.g., behavioral data of distinct nature and neuroimaging data) on the MTMM. Although the analysis above already lays out the means in which triangulation can help improve the validity of fMRI studies, quantifying such improvement would provide the proposed triangulation with even more solid footing. Thus, we advocate the quantification of the proposed triangulation as a direction for future research. \n\n\n### Toward an Interpretable Consumer Neuroscience \n  \nRecent years have witnessed an increase in the important discussion regarding how to promote openness and transparency of research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In solidarity with the fields\u2019 joint effort toward a more precise and interpretable discipline, we also take the opportunity to advocate these practices in consumer neuroscience. For example, we suggest that consumer researchers could report information regarding experimental design, image acquisition, preprocessing, statistical modeling and statistical inferences, as well as result tables, which could be provided in a web appendix alongside the main paper. Some guidelines and checklists are provided, for instance, by   and in the appendix to  . These practices may be helpful to make research reports more interpretable. \n\nAnother laudable practice is data sharing. This practice is more than just academic integrity, but also improves the validity of data analysis. In a recent paper published in   Nature   ( ), 70 independent teams of researchers were asked to analyze the same dataset. Since no two teams employed the same workflow of analysis, this flexibility in data analysis creates a considerable variation in the results of hypotheses testing. When the results from teams are aggregated, however, they show a significant convergence on activated regions. Thus, for better cross-validation, consumer neuroscientists may want to consider sharing data, which can be done with dedicated online repositories such as   ( ),   ( ), and  . Furthermore, we encourage consumer researchers to share the workflow by which the data were analyzed, and report (if applicable) the code they used to analyze scan data on online platforms such as   to further promote transparency, openness, and cross-validation. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nConsumer neuroscience may hold valuable insights for the advancement of consumer research, with perhaps the most intriguing of these being its potential to (1) reveal hidden cognitive and emotional processes that have been inaccessible to traditional research methods and (2) to confirm physiological and psychological processes underlying consumer behavior. Indeed, over the years, consumer researchers have been employing fMRI, along with other neuroimaging techniques, in an attempt to open the black boxes of consumer experience, motivation, decision-making, and so on. Needless to say, fMRI has shed new light upon our understanding of consumer behavior, and we fully acknowledge the important contributions made by the field. That being said, as we pointed out earlier, many studies\u2019 reliance on reverse inference may render them vulnerable to validity issues. To promote the validity of individual neuroimaging studies as well as consumer neuroscience as a field, in this paper we advocate for the triangulation of neuroimaging data with meta-analyses as well as psychometric and behavioral data. We believe these research practices may substantially increase the conclusions we can draw from fMRI data. Therefore, we encourage the employment of data triangulation in consumer neuroscience research. Lastly, we take this opportunity to offer our special acknowledgment to the intensive methodological discussions and disputes taking place in our parent disciplines, such as cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging, as this paper draws largely upon their lessons and wisdom. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nCC conducted the review on extant literature and the analysis on reverse inference in the frontend with the consent of MR.

However, existing classification criteria (Fischer & Carpenter Jr.,\u00a0 ) are challenged by results of recent studies which have shown co\u2010aggregation of risk genes (Huang et al.,\u00a0 ; Lee et al.,\u00a0 ), shared neurobiological and neuropsychological features (Goodkind et al.,\u00a0 ), and considerable overlap in clinical presentations (Wei et al.,\u00a0 ), including affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ), and impairments in cognitive functioning, particularly working memory (WM) (Hsu et al.,\u00a0 ; Pu, Noda, Setoyama, & Nakagome,\u00a0 ; Wei et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhu et al.,\u00a0 ), in SZ and MDD. Accordingly, there is interest to investigate to what extent SZ and MDD share a common pathophysiology and in the present study the question is addressed by performing a meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies involving WM tasks. \n\nImpairment of WM is common in a range of psychiatric disorders including SZ and MDD and the severity of the deficit depends on diagnosis (Forbes, Carrick, McIntosh, & Lawrie,\u00a0 ; Lever, Werkle\u2010Bergner, Brandmaier, Ridderinkhof, & Geurts,\u00a0 ; Schwarz, Tost, & Meyer\u2010Lindenberg,\u00a0 ; Snyder,\u00a0 ; Yamashita et al.,\u00a0 ), with greater impairments associated with higher values of a factor representing general psychopathology (Caspi et al.,\u00a0 ). In the case of SZ, there have been consistent reports, including those in reviews, of the existence of WM impairment in patients relative to healthy controls (HC) (Barch & Sheffield,\u00a0 ; Kaminski et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim, Glahn, Nuechterlein, & Cannon,\u00a0 ; Mayer, Stablein, Oertel\u2010Knochel, & Fiebach,\u00a0 ; Noort et al.,\u00a0 ; Park & Gooding,\u00a0 ; Piskulic, Olver, Norman, & Maruff,\u00a0 ; Pu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schaefer, Giangrande, Weinberger, & Dickinson,\u00a0 ; Schlagenhauf et al.,\u00a0 ; Trapp et al.,\u00a0 ). On the other hand, in the case of MDD, relative to HC, WM performance has sometimes been reported to be impaired (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Christopher & MacDonald,\u00a0 ; Egeland et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Noort et al.,\u00a0 ; Pu et al.,\u00a0 ; Pu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schwert, Stohrer, Aschenbrenner, Weisbrod, & Schr\u00f6der,\u00a0 ) or sometimes not (Channon, Baker, & Robertson,\u00a0 ; Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ; Trapp et al.,\u00a0 ; Yuksel et al.,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, WM deficits have been reported to increase over time in SZ (Fu, Czajkowski, & Torgalsboen,\u00a0 ; Jimenez\u2010Lopez et al.,\u00a0 ; Park, P\u00fcschel, Sauter, Rentsch, & Hell,\u00a0 ; Strugstad, Lau, & Glenne Oie,\u00a0 ), but not in MDD (Nuninga et al.,\u00a0 ; Sankar, Adams, Costafreda, Marangell, & Fu,\u00a0 ; Vasavada et al.,\u00a0 ; Zuidersma, Comijs, Naarding, & Oude Voshaar,\u00a0 ). WM is also more impaired in SZ than in MDD (Egeland et al.,\u00a0 ; Mahmood, Burton, Vella, & Twamley,\u00a0 ; Yamashita et al.,\u00a0 ), and measurement of WM deficit may represent a promising endophenotype for studying the disorders (Glahn et al.,\u00a0 ). Accordingly, intensive efforts are being made to characterize the neurobiological substrate that underpins impairments in WM performance in SZ and MDD. Many fMRI studies involving performance of WM tasks have been performed in cohorts of patients with SZ and MDD and there is only a partial overlap in the findings pertaining to the two disorders. The findings are summarized below. \n\nOne recent meta\u2010analysis of 52 fMRI studies of WM tasks performed by patients with SZ that used an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, found that relative to HC, patients exhibited stronger fMRI response in left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and posterior parietal cortex, and weaker fMRI response in bilateral dorso\u2010lateral pre\u2010frontal cortex (DLPFC) and left insula, which are components of the central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN), together with stronger fMRI response in right ventro\u2010medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) which are part of the default mode network (DMN) (Park & Gooding,\u00a0 ; Wu & Jiang,\u00a0 ). In other studies stronger fMRI response in bilateral pre\u2010frontal cortex (PFC) including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ACC, PCC, superior temporal cortex (STC), middle temporal cortex (MTC) and cuneus, and right occipital cortex and parahippocampus, and weaker fMRI response in bilateral DLPFC, right MPFC, insula, parietal cortex and ventral striatum and left posterior cerebellum, during performance of WM tasks by patients with SZ compared to HC have been reported (Glahn et al.,\u00a0 ; Meyer\u2010Lindenberg et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Snellenberg et al.,  ). In several studies, including a meta\u2010analysis (Van Snellenberg, Torres, & Thornton,\u00a0 ), a region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed specifically for DLPFC and found stronger fMRI response (Karlsgodt et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoach et al.,\u00a0 ; Potkin et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Snellenberg et al.,\u00a0 ), weaker fMRI response (Fan et al.,  ; Kaminski et al.,\u00a0 ; Menon, Anagnoson, Mathalon, Glover, & Pfefferbaum,\u00a0 ; Pu et al.,\u00a0 ) or no significant difference in fMRI response (Van Snellenberg et al.,\u00a0 ) in patients with SZ compared to HC. Additionally, using independent component analysis (ICA), several fMRI studies of WM tasks have revealed significant alterations of fMRI response in patients with SZ relative to HC, which are either correlated or anti\u2010correlated with WM performance, including stronger fMRI response in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), PCC, insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior temporal gyrus, precuneus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, putamen and cerebellum, left DLPFC, cingulate gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (Chatterjee et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ), and weaker fMRI response in bilateral dentate gyrus and cerebellum (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). These findings suggest that the aforementioned brain regions may be implicated in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying impairment of WM in SZ (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nA meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies of WM tasks performed by patients with MDD found that relative to HC, patients exhibited significantly different fMRI response in cortical\u2013limbic circuitry, namely stronger fMRI response in left DLPFC, ventral lateral pre\u2010frontal cortex (VLPFC), precentral gyrus and insula, and right temporal and supramarginal cortex, and weaker fMRI response in right precentral gyrus, insula and precuneus (Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). Significant alterations of fMRI response in left SFG, angular gyrus, right frontal\u2013parietal regions and thalamus have also been reported in patients with MDD (Yuksel et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, weaker fMRI response in bilateral PFC including DLPFC and VLPFC, and STC was consistently reported in two near infra\u2010red spectroscopy (NIRS) studies of patients with MDD (Pu et al.,\u00a0 ; Schecklmann et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThere is considerable heterogeneity among the studies referred to above in terms of sample size, demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects, psychotropic medication and the image acquisition and analysis protocols used (Fusar\u2010Poli et al.,\u00a0 ; Jalbrzikowski et al.,\u00a0 ; Park et al.,\u00a0 ; Wible et al.,\u00a0 ), which may account for some of the inconsistent findings reported. Small sample sizes may, in particular, produce false\u2010positive or false\u2010negative results (Button et al.,\u00a0 ; Oakes,\u00a0 ; van Ravenzwaaij & Ioannidis,  ). To the best of our knowledge, there has been only one previous meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies of cognitive control tasks, including WM, performed by patients with a range of psychiatric disorders across Axis I diagnoses, which include SZ and MDD (McTeague et al.,\u00a0 ). This meta\u2010analysis revealed a trans\u2010diagnostic pattern of significantly different brain fMRI response in patients relative to HC, involving left DLPFC, right VLPFC, ACC, pre\u2010supplementary motor cortex and insula. The present meta\u2010analysis was performed to specifically compare fMRI response due to performance of WM tasks in patients with SZ and MDD, relative to HC. The primary objective of the current study was to determine which response may be shared by patients with SZ and MDD, and the secondary objective was to investigate which anomalies may be specific to either SZ or MDD. In addition, potential confounders (i.e., age, sex\u2010ratio, handedness, and clinical symptoms) that may account for differences in fMRI response between diagnostic groups were investigated. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nA computer\u2010based literature search was performed using the PubMed ( ), Embase ( ) and Web of Science ( ) databases to identify fMRI studies in which brain response in patients with SZ and/or MDD during performance of WM tasks was compared to that in HC, and which had been published in the English language in peer\u2010reviewed journals (including articles available online only at the time of the search) prior to August 19, 2020. Only studies of SZ and MDD, located at the extremes of the neurobiological continuum from SZ, schizophreniform, schizoaffective, bipolar disorder to MDD (Benazzi,\u00a0 ; Clementz et al.,\u00a0 ; Pearlson,\u00a0 ), were included. In each search engine the following combinations of search terms were used: \u201cschizophrenia OR schizophreni* OR severe mental illness\u201d OR \u201cunipolar depressi* OR depressed OR depress* disorder OR major depression OR major depressive disorder OR MDD\u201d AND \u201cfunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging OR functional MRI OR fMRI OR Magnetic Resonance Imaging OR MRI OR neuroimaging OR brain imaging\u201d AND \u201cWorking Memory OR WM OR visual span OR spatial span OR digit span OR short\u2010term memory OR STM.\u201d Use of these broad search terms minimized the likelihood of missing relevant studies. The retrieved articles, including relevant reviews and meta\u2010analyses, were searched to identify studies that were potentially missed in the computer\u2010based searches. Furthermore, authors of papers were occasionally contacted with a request to clarify details and confirm the appropriateness of certain studies. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe meta\u2010analysis was performed according to guidelines proposed by Stroup et al.\u00a0( ) for a Meta\u2010analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). Thus a study was included if (i) precise diagnosis of SZ or MDD had been made, (ii) fMRI related brain response during performance of WM tasks was compared between patients with SZ, and/or MDD, and HC aged 18 to 65\u2009years, (iii) the study was published in English as an original paper in a peer\u2010reviewed journal, (iv) a whole brain approach was used for analysis and (v) results were reported in standard stereotactic coordinates (i.e., Talairach/Tournoux space or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] space). In the case that studies met the inclusion criteria but had overlapping data, only the study with the largest sample size was selected. If results for more than one experiment were reported in a paper, each eligible experiment was included in the meta\u2010analysis as a unique dataset. If a study investigated several sub\u2010group comparisons, then a combined summary result was defined for potential inclusion in the meta\u2010analysis. For studies that used longitudinal treatment designs, only baseline pre\u2010treatment results were included. \n\nA study was excluded if (i) cohorts included individuals with schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder or bipolar depression, (ii) the diagnosis of SZ or MDD was comorbid with serious medical conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy or multiple sclerosis, (iii) SZ and MDD had been investigated as a comorbid psychiatric condition, (iv) WM experiments were embedded within affective manipulations (e.g., use of affective stimuli, mood induction and without inclusion of neutral stimuli), in view of the known significant interaction between WM and emotion (Woody et al.,\u00a0 ), (v) results were reported only after using a small\u2010volume correction or for an ROI or (vi) the data were incomplete (e.g., missing neuroanatomical coordinates) even after the author(s) were contacted via e\u2010mail. \n\nTo minimize data extraction errors the search and inclusion of literature was independently conducted by two researchers (XL and BC) according to the AES\u2010SDM method (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ) and any disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nA quality score was computed for each of the selected studies using a 15 point checklist used in previous meta\u2010analyses (Sanderson, Tatt, & Higgins,\u00a0 ; Shepherd, Matheson, Laurens, Carr, & Green,\u00a0 ). In particular, the demographic and clinical characteristics, the diagnostic procedures, the selection of participants, WM task design, MRI acquisition parameters, data analysis technique and quality of the reported results were assessed (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Voxel\u2010based meta\u2010analysis \n  \nAnisotropic Effect\u2010Size Seed\u2010based D Mapping (AES\u2010SDM) software version 5.15 ( ) (Radua, Rubia, et al.,  ) was used to identify those brain regions which showed consistent significant differences in fMRI response between SZ, MDD and HC during performance of WM tasks. The steps of the method can be summarized as follows. Peak coordinates and statistical parametric maps were used to produce whole brain effect size and variance maps, which are used to perform a random\u2010effect voxel\u2010wise meta\u2010analyses. Importantly, studies with negative findings (i.e., when no significant differences were found between patients with SZ or MDD and HC) can be included with a null effect size (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). AES\u2010SDM also provides the facility for multi\u2010modal analysis to be performed to identify regions where both SZ and MDD groups show common differences in fMRI response relative to HC (Radua, van den Heuvel, Surguladze, & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). A filter with Full\u2010Width at Half\u2010Maximum (FWHM) of 20\u2009mm was applied, which is considered to represent a good compromise between high sensitivity for detection of significant effects, and avoidance of false positive results (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n#### Main meta\u2010analyses \n  \nA brain map of the effect size for each of the studies was recreated from the average of 50 random permutations using peak coordinates and effect sizes (derived, for example, from t values) of differences in fMRI response between patients with SZ, or MDD, and HC by means of an anisotropic Gaussian kernel. The threshold was set at   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (voxel level), with   z  \u2009>\u20091 (peak height) and a cluster extent \u2265 10 voxels (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Reliability analysis \n  \nJack\u2010knife sensitivity analysis was applied to investigate the effect of an individual study on the estimated pooled effect size by repeating the meta\u2010analysis in successive iterations after discarding each individual study. If a brain region remains significant in more than 80% of the combinations of studies, the finding is considered highly replicable. \n\n\n#### Heterogeneity and publication bias analysis \n  \nThe statistical heterogeneity of individual clusters was examined using a random effect model with   Q  /  Q   statistics (  \u03c7   distribution converted to   z   scores) and tested with a permutation approach (  p  \u2009<\u2009.005, uncorrected for FDR; peak height   z  \u2009>\u20091; cluster extent\u00a0=\u00a0100 voxels). In addition, publication bias was evaluated by using Egger's test to assess the asymmetry of funnel plots of the data corresponding to each significant cluster in the between\u2010group comparisons (Radua, Grau, et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Meta\u2010regression analyses \n  \nMeta\u2010regression analyses (Radua & Mataix\u2010Cols,\u00a0 ) were performed to investigate which confounding variables may contribute to heterogeneity of the findings. In particular, potential effects of age, sex\u2010ratio, age of onset, duration of illness, symptom scores, medication of subjects and imaging parameters were evaluated by using a linear random\u2010effect model with threshold   p  \u2009<\u2009.0005. Only brain regions with significant results in the main meta\u2010analysis were considered in the meta\u2010regression analysis. \n\n\n#### Sub\u2010group meta\u2010analyses \n  \nTo control for heterogeneity between the cohorts in the selected studies, sub\u2010group meta\u2010analyses were performed in which only those studies which recruited patients with stable SZ, or MDD in a current depressive episode, were included and furthermore in which only verbal WM tasks were employed. In this way it was possible to examine potential associations between the brain imaging findings, clinical classification and the integrity of verbal neurocognitive systems in both disorders. \n\n\n#### Conjunction analysis between meta\u2010analysis groups \n  \nA conjunction analysis could also be performed using AES\u2010SDM to compare the results obtained between different meta\u2010analytic groups (for example, SZ relative to HC versus MDD relative to HC). In particular, a linear modal tool was employed to perform effect size comparisons between SZ and MDD in respect of the studies included in the main meta\u2010analyses, using a less conservative threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and cluster extent of 100 voxels (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ). The multi\u2010modal analysis function of AES\u2010SDM also made it possible to identify brain regions where the single main meta\u2010analysis of SZ and MDD groups relative to respective HC showed robust common abnormalities, taking into account the error in the estimation of   p   values within the individual meta\u2010analyses (Radua, Romeo, Mataix\u2010Cols, & Fusar\u2010Poli,\u00a0 ; Wise et al.,\u00a0 ). The statistical significance of each voxel was determined using randomization tests with threshold set to   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 to avoid false positives (Radua et al.,\u00a0 ; Wise, Cleare, Herane, Young, & Arnone,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Characteristics of included studies \n  \nA total of 52 published papers fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the meta\u2010analysis (see Figure\u00a0 ). The WM paradigms used in these papers mainly involved in Back (44 papers), delayed matching to sample (DMTS) (2 papers), and Sternberg Item Recognition (SIR) (2 papers), with four papers using other, less common WM tasks. Demographic and clinical information pertaining to the SZ, MDD and HC cohorts included in the main and sub\u2010group meta\u2010analyses are presented in Table\u00a0 . The corresponding quality assessment scores ranged from 8 to 14.5 points (mean 12.3 points), and 10 to 13.5 points (mean 12.4 points), for SZ and MDD studies respectively (see Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nFlow chart of literature search \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of studies included in main meta\u2010analyses and subgroup analyses for patients with SZ and MDD \n    \n#### Schizophrenia \n  \nThirty\u2010four published papers which refer to 38 different fMRI studies of WM in which whole brain response was compared between patients with SZ and HC, and refer to a total of 1,126 patients with SZ and 1,139 HC, were included. The demographic and clinical information for the subjects and details of the WM tasks for the included studies are presented in Table\u00a0 . There were no significant differences between SZ and HC groups in respect of age (SZ: 33.35\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67\u2009years, HC: 32.13\u2009\u00b1\u20095.34\u2009years,   t  \u00a0=\u00a00.936,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.352), right handedness (SZ: 732/749\u00a0=\u00a097.73%, HC: 818/830\u00a0=\u00a098.55%,   \u03c7  \u00a0=\u00a00.014,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.914) or the percentage of the cohorts who were male (SZ: 710/1035\u00a0=\u00a068.60%, HC: 654/1056\u00a0=\u00a061.93%,   \u03c7  \u00a0=\u00a02.156,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.076). \n\n\n#### Major depressive disorder \n  \nEighteen published papers which refer to 20 different fMRI studies of WM in which whole brain response was compared between patients with MDD and HC, and refer to a total of 426 patients with MDD and 425 HC, were included. The demographic and clinical information for the subjects and details of the WM tasks for the included studies are presented in Table\u00a0 . There were no significant differences between MDD and HC groups in respect of age (MDD: 36.05\u2009\u00b1\u20096.95\u2009years, HC: 34.87\u2009\u00b1\u20096.76\u2009years,   t  \u00a0=\u00a00.530,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.600), right handedness (MDD: 325/332\u00a0=\u00a097.89%, HC: 332/343\u00a0=\u00a096.79%,   \u03c7  \u00a0=\u00a00.011,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.956) or the percentage of the cohorts who were male (MDD: 178/417\u00a0=\u00a042.69%, HC: 185/416\u00a0=\u00a044.47%,   \u03c7  \u00a0=\u00a00.106,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.754). \n\n\n\n### Differences in   fMRI   response between patients and   HC   groups \n  \n####  SZ   patients versus   HC  \n  \n##### Main analysis \n  \nRelative to HC, patients with SZ showed significantly stronger fMRI response in left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), including bilateral gyrus rectus, SFG and right ACG, left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), including bilateral median cingulate/paracingulate gyri and right PCG, left MTG including left fusiform gyrus, right precentral gyrus including right SMA, right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), including right fusiform gyrus and STG, and right superior occipital gyrus (SOG), together with significantly weaker fMRI response in left MFG including left precentral gyrus, left precuneus, right SMA, including left SFG and SMA, right striatum, including right insula and putamen, right caudate nucleus, and right cerebellar hemispheric lobule including cerebellar vermis (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nClusters showing differences in fMRI response between patients with SZ or MDD and controls that met the criteria for robustness \n      \n(a) Results of meta\u2010analysis of brain fMRI response due to performance of working memory (WM) tasks in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) with red and blue clusters representing significantly stronger response, and significantly weaker response, in patients with SZ relative to healthy controls (HC), respectively.

(c) Brain regions showing significant differences in fMRI response due to performance of WM tasks between patients with SZ and patients with MDD. Purple and green clusters represent significantly stronger response, and significantly weaker response in SZ compared to MDD, relative to HC, respectively, with the effects frequently being more substantial in patients with SZ than in patients with MDD. (d) Results of conjunction analysis. Brain regions overlapping in red and yellow (i.e., orange) exhibit similar stronger fMRI response due to performance of WM tasks in SZ and MDD. ACG, anterior cingulate gyrus; CAU, caudate nucleus; DCG, median cingulate gyrus; FFG, fusiform gyrus; L, left; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; MOG, middle occipital gyrus; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; PCG, posterior cingulate gyrus; PCUN, precuneus; PreCG, precentral gyrus; R, right, REC, gyrus rectus; SFG, superior frontal gyrus; SMA, supplementary motor area; STG, superior temporal gyrus \n  \n\n##### Meta\u2010regression analyses \n  \nMeta\u2010regression analyses revealed that, relative to HC, SZ patients with more severe psychiatric symptoms as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores showed significantly stronger fMRI response in left PCG (peak MNI\u00a0=\u00a00, \u221242, 22,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a01.209,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, 45 voxels, Figure\u00a0 ), and significantly weaker fMRI response in left MFG (peak MNI\u00a0=\u00a0\u221238, 8, 54,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.251,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, 39 voxels, Figure\u00a0 ). Differences in mean age, handedness, sex percent, years of education, age of onset, duration of illness, proportion of subjects taking antipsychotics, dose of chlorpromazine of the SZ patients and MRI parameters among the included studies had no significant effect on these findings. \n  \n(a1\u20102) Results of meta\u2010regression analysis of the dependence of brain fMRI response on severity of psychotic symptoms in patients with SZ, and (b1\u20102) results of meta\u2010regression analysis of the dependence of brain fMRI response on severity of depression in patients with MDD \n  \n\n##### Sub\u2010group meta\u2010analyses \n  \nDetails of the results of sub\u2010group analyses are presented in Table\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n####  MDD   patients versus   HC  \n  \n##### Main analysis \n  \nRelative to HC, patients with MDD showed significantly stronger fMRI response in left median cingulate gyri, including bilateral ACG and right SFG, right STG and fusiform gyrus, together with significantly weaker fMRI response in left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and right MFG (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Meta\u2010regression analyses \n  \nMeta\u2010regression analyses revealed that relative to HC, MDD patients with increasing severity of depression symptoms as measured by Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores showed significantly stronger fMRI response in right fusiform gyrus (peak MNI\u00a0=\u00a032, \u221238, \u221218,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a01.738,   p  \u2009<\u2009.0001, 552\u2013434 voxels, Figure\u00a0 ), together with significantly weaker fMRI response in right MFG (peak MNI\u00a0=\u00a030, 44, 28,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.785,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, 114 voxels, Figure\u00a0 ). Differences in mean age, handedness, sex percent, years of education, duration of illness, proportion of subjects taking antidepressants and antipsychotics, and MRI parameters among the included studies had no significant effect on these findings. Due to their being less than nine studies in which age of onset was reported in the original publication, the effect of potential differences in this variable could not be investigated. \n\n\n##### Sub\u2010group meta\u2010analyses \n  \nDetails of the results of sub\u2010group analyses are presented in Table\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n\n### Differences in   fMRI   response between   SZ   and   MDD  \n  \nCompared to patients with MDD, patients with SZ showed significantly stronger fMRI response in left gyrus rectus, including bilateral ACG, SFG and right gyrus rectus, left PCG including right PCG, right fusiform gyrus, including right STG, MTG, ITG and parahippocampal gyrus, together with significantly weaker fMRI response in left MFG including left precentral gyrus, right striatum, and right cerebellar hemispheric lobule including left cerebellar hemispheric lobule and cerebellar vermic lobule, relative to HC (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nClusters showing different and similar alterations in fMRI response in SZ and MDD that met our criteria for robustness \n    \n\n### Stronger   fMRI   response shared in   SZ   and   MDD  \n  \nConjunction analysis revealed that relative to HC, patients with SZ and patients with MDD showed concordant stronger fMRI response during performance of WM tasks in right SFG including bilateral ACG, with the effect being greater in patients with SZ than patients with MDD (Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). These regions are part of the DMN (Schilbach et al.,\u00a0 ), which typically shows task\u2010induced suppression during performance of externally oriented cognitive tasks (Buckner, Andrews\u2010Hanna, & Schacter,\u00a0 ; Esposito et al.,\u00a0 ). No brain region was identified which showed significantly weaker fMRI response that was common to both SZ and MDD relative to HC. \n\n\n### Analyses of sensitivity, heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nWhole brain jack\u2010knife sensitivity analysis of the results of the 38 WM studies in patients with SZ included in the main meta\u2010analysis, showed that, relative to HC, significantly stronger fMRI response in bilateral MTG, left ACG and PCG, right precentral gyrus and SOG, and significantly weaker fMRI response in left MFG and precuneus, right caudate and cerebellum were present in all 38 datasets, and significantly weaker fMRI response in right SMA and striatum was present in 37 of the 38 datasets (Table\u00a0 ). In comparison, whole brain jack\u2010knife sensitivity analysis of the results of the 20 WM studies in patients with MDD included in the main meta\u2010analysis, showed that, relative to HC, significantly stronger fMRI response in left median cingulate/paracingulate gyri was present in all 20 datasets, while significantly stronger fMRI response in right STG and fusiform gyrus, and significantly weaker fMRI response in left MOG and right MFG were present in 18 of the 20 datasets (Table\u00a0 ). \n\nThe heterogeneity analyses revealed that the clusters with significantly stronger or weaker fMRI response in patients with SZ and MDD relative to HC in the main meta\u2010analyses and conjunction analysis showed significant statistical heterogeneity among studies (  p  \u2009<\u2009.005) (see Tables\u00a0 ). There was no evidence of publication bias for any of the clusters reported as significant, as indicated by a nonsignificant result for Egger's funnel plot asymmetry test (  p  \u2009>\u2009.05 for all comparisons including SZ versus HC, MDD versus HC, and SZ versus MDD) (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe present meta\u2010analysis revealed common brain regions exhibiting stronger fMRI response during performance of WM tasks in patients with SZ and MDD relative to HC, including bilateral ACC and right MPFC which are part of the DMN. The magnitude of the effects was significantly greater in patients with SZ than patients with MDD, especially in prefrontal\u2010temporal\u2010cingulate\u2010striatal\u2010cerebellar regions, suggesting a greater neurobiological disruption in SZ than MDD. Disorder\u2010specific weaker fMRI response was observed in right MFG in MDD. These findings provide new evidence of a common neurobiological substrate of SZ and MDD and Disorder\u2010specific substrate of MDD. In addition, the severity of psychotic symptoms in patients with SZ was related to the strength of the fMRI response of MFG and PCG in left hemisphere, and the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD was related to the strength of the fMRI response of MFG and fusiform gyrus in right hemisphere. \n\n### Common alterations of   fMRI   response in   SZ   and   MDD  \n  \nThe results of the present meta\u2010analysis are consistent with the suggestion that dysfunction of the DMN is a common feature of the pathophysiology of SZ and MDD (Kim et al.,\u00a0 ; Li et al.,\u00a0 ). The brain regions which exhibited stronger fMRI response during performance of WM tasks in patients with SZ and MDD relative to HC, lie predominantly in the DMN, including bilateral ACC and right MPFC, despite some differences in the specific location of stronger fMRI response in MPFC between the two disorders. This observation is consistent with reports of stronger fMRI response of MPFC and ACC in SZ (Chatterjee et al.,\u00a0 ; Glahn et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ; Metzak et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Snellenberg et al.,\u00a0 ; Whitfield\u2010Gabrieli et al.,\u00a0 ; Wu & Jiang,\u00a0 ) and MDD (Gartner et al.,\u00a0 ; Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ; Rodriguez\u2010Cano et al.,\u00a0 ) relative to HC. In addition, during WM processing stronger fMRI response in multiple sub\u2010networks of the DMN in SZ (Haatveit et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ) and reduced response suppression of the DMN in MDD (Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ) relative to HC have been reported. Additional evidence of abnormal resting\u2010state activity of VMPFC in SZ and MDD, comes from an ALE meta\u2010analysis (Kuhn & Gallinat,\u00a0 ), and other studies which reported disconnectivity of VMPFC regions of the DMN (Li et al.,\u00a0 ; Schilbach et al.,\u00a0 ; Sharma et al.,\u00a0 ; Yan et al.,\u00a0 ). Stronger fMRI response and increased connectivity of DMN regions have been reported to be associated with inferior WM performance in patients with SZ (Van Snellenberg et al.,\u00a0 ; Whitfield\u2010Gabrieli et al.,\u00a0 ). MPFC represents the anterior node of the DMN (Schilbach et al.,\u00a0 ), and suppression of fMRI response in the DMN is considered to be critical for suppressing sources of interference and successful performance of externally\u2010focused tasks by healthy subjects (Anticevic et al.,\u00a0 ; Buckner et al.,\u00a0 ; Harrison, Yucel, Pujol, & Pantelis,\u00a0 ). The possibility exists that a common neurobiological substrate causes an impaired ability to suppress task\u2010irrelevant information during WM performance in both SZ and MDD, reflected by stronger fMRI response in regions of the DMN (Gartner et al.,\u00a0 ; Murphy et al.,\u00a0 ; Van Snellenberg et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThere have been many reports that function of large scale brain networks, particularly the so\u2010called triple network comprising DMN, CEN and SN, is disrupted in both SZ and MDD (Brandl et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kaiser, Andrews\u2010Hanna, Wager, & Pizzagalli,\u00a0 ; Menon,\u00a0 ; Sha et al.,\u00a0 ; Shao et al.,\u00a0 ), with high consistency among findings for DMN and SN (Han et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Menon,\u00a0 ; Shao et al.,\u00a0 ), which may contribute to shared cognitive and affective impairments in both disorders. For example, it was reported that, relative to HC, there were aberrant intra\u2010network intrinsic resting\u2010state functional connectivity within DMN, CEN and SN in SZ (Manoliu et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoliu et al.,\u00a0 ) and MDD (Liu et al.,\u00a0 ; Liu et al.,\u00a0 ), and abnormal inter\u2010network intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between DMN, CEN and SN in SZ (Bauer et al.,\u00a0 ; Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kang et al.,\u00a0 ; Kang et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoliu et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoliu, Riedl, et al.,\u00a0 ) and MDD (Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoliu et al.,\u00a0 ; Peng et al.,\u00a0 ; Wang et al.,\u00a0 ). A dynamical dependence of the connectivity between DMN and CEN on the SN has also been reported to be impaired in SZ and MDD (Dai, Zhou, Xu, & Zuo,\u00a0 ; Lefebvre et al.,\u00a0 ; Manoliu et al.,\u00a0 ). In addition, load\u2010dependent fMRI response of the task\u2010positive networks (TPN, including the CEN, SN and dorsal attention network) has been reported to be anticorrelated with that in the DMN during performance of WM tasks by patients with SZ spectrum disorders (Haatveit et al.,\u00a0 ) and MDD (Delaveau et al.,\u00a0 ), suggesting that a common mechanism may underlie aberrant TPN\u2010DMN interactions in both disorders. Abnormal stronger fMRI response in DMN regions during performance of WM tasks may therefore be interpreted as a failure of task\u2010related suppression of the DMN by the TPN (Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ), which may lead to less flexible allocation of functional capacity during dynamic transitions between task and rest states (Nygard et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Disorder\u2010specific alteration of   fMRI   response in   MDD  \n  \nIn addition to stronger fMRI response in the DMN regions during performance of WM tasks that is common to patients with SZ and patients with MDD, relative to HC, the main and sub\u2010group analyses consistently revealed weaker fMRI response in right MFG only in patients with MDD relative to HC. The weaker fMRI response during performance of a WM task was also reported in PFC including right MFG in patients with MDD relative to HC (Vasic, Walter, Sambataro, & Wolf,\u00a0 ). Additional evidence for abnormal functioning of the frontal lobe in MDD comes from two studies using NIRS. In particular, Goethals et al.\u00a0( ) reported a reduced perfusion response in right MFG during performance of a range of cognitive tasks including WM, and Zhu et al.\u00a0( ) reported weaker fMRI response in PFC during performance of a WM task. Xia et al.\u00a0( ) analyzed resting\u2010state fMRI data and reported increased medium\u2010/long\u2010range connectivity in right MFG in patients with MDD relative to HC. Consistent with the above, the finding of the present study suggests that functional abnormalities of right MFG during performance of WM tasks may be a disorder\u2010specific feature of MDD. \n\n\n### Greater abnormalities of   fMRI   response in   SZ   than   MDD  \n  \nRelative to HC, patients with SZ showed greater abnormalities in fMRI response during performance of WM tasks than patients with MDD, in prefrontal\u2010temporal\u2010cingulate\u2010striatal\u2010cerebellar regions and fusiform gyrus. Some of these regions are part of the triple network (Dai et al.,\u00a0 ; Jiang et al.,\u00a0 ; Wu & Jiang,\u00a0 ). Specifically, relative to HC, patients with SZ showed stronger fMRI response in regions of the DMN during performance of WM tasks than patients with MDD, consistent with research of cognitive tasks other than WM (Holmes et al.,\u00a0 ; Hugdahl et al.,\u00a0 ). From inter\u2010network connectivity patients with SZ exhibited greater iFC between DMN and CEN (Gong et al.,\u00a0 ), and less iFC between DMN and SN (Shao et al.,\u00a0 ) than patients with MDD, which may reflect unbalanced recruitment of the triple network in SZ and MDD. These findings may suggest a greater impairment in SZ than MDD in suppressing task\u2010irrelevant information during performance of WM tasks (Shao et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThere were also greater abnormalities in fMRI response during performance of WM tasks in patients with SZ than MDD relative to HC in regions other than the DMN. For example, stronger fMRI response was observed in bilateral SFG, gyrus rectus and PCC, right STG, MTG, ITG, fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, together with weaker fMRI response in left MFG, right striatum and bilateral cerebellum. There have been several previous reports of stronger fMRI response in bilateral SFG and PCC, left MTG, precuneus and angle, and right precentral gyrus, and weaker fMRI response in left superior frontal lobe, right SFG, MFG and precentral gyrus, and basal ganglia in patients with SZ than those with MDD during performance of other cognitive tasks (Genzel et al.,\u00a0 ; Holmes et al.,\u00a0 ; Hugdahl et al.,\u00a0 ; Wensing et al.,\u00a0 ). It was also proposed that patients with SZ tended to over\u2010recruit task\u2010positive regions during low\u2010load operations, perhaps reflecting heightened non\u2010specific vigilance or effort when dealing with cognitive challenges in this disorder (Hahn, Harvey, Gold, Ross, & Stein,\u00a0 ). This is consistent with a reported gradient of increasing impairment in neurocognitive function and social outcomes in the order of SZ\u2009>\u2009bipolar disorder > MDD, which mirrors the clinical severity and outcomes for patients with these disorders (Reichenberg et al.,\u00a0 ; Velthorst et al.,\u00a0 ). Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that patients with SZ show greater alterations of fMRI response for a large number of brain regions, including the DMN, than patients with MDD. This may reflect that patients with SZ face greater challenges in performing WM tasks. \n\nThe separate meta\u2010analyses performed for patients with SZ relative to HC and patients with MDD relative to HC are not well matched in terms of the numbers of studies and cohort characteristics, especially clinical variables. In particular, the unbalanced numbers of original papers in the two meta\u2010analyses (34 for SZ versus HC and 18 for MDD versus HC) may affect the accuracy of the findings, especially on account of significant bias arising from the lower number of studies of MDD (Lin, Li, Jing, Ran, & Sun,\u00a0 ; Xu et al.,\u00a0 ). There are also challenges in separating depressive symptoms from psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients with SZ (Mintz, Dobson, & Romney,\u00a0 ; Pacitti et al.,\u00a0 ; Sevy, Nathanson, Visweswaraiah, & Amador,\u00a0 ; Xu, Li, Liu, & Zhong,\u00a0 ), and especially cognitive impairments from severe depressive symptoms (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ; Fang, Chen, Wang, Ren, & Zhang,\u00a0 ), which may affect performance of WM tasks in fMRI studies. Caution is needed in applying meta\u2010analytical methods in the presence of between\u2010group heterogeneity, especially in comparing the results of meta\u2010analysis with unbalanced numbers of studies (Seide, Rover, & Friede,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Effects of clinical symptoms on   fMRI   response \n  \nFor both SZ and MDD a significant correlation was observed between the severity of clinical symptoms and the strength of fMRI response during performance of WM tasks relative to HC (see Figure\u00a0 ). In particular, SZ patients with more severe symptoms of psychosis showed weaker fMRI response in left MFG and stronger fMRI response in left PCC relative to HC. This finding is consistent with reports of a negative correlation between positive psychiatric symptoms (i.e., auditory hallucinations and thinking disturbance) and fMRI response in left inferior frontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal regions, and right MFG (Menon et al.,\u00a0 ; Wible et al.,\u00a0 ), and between scores on the PANSS general psychopathology and fMRI response in left frontal eye field (Chen et al.,\u00a0 ), as well as a positive correlation between negative psychiatric symptoms and fMRI response in right DLPFC (Jalbrzikowski et al.,\u00a0 ) during performance of WM tasks. \n\nSimilarly, relative to HC, MDD patients with more severe symptoms of depression showed weaker fMRI response in right MFG and stronger fMRI response in right fusiform gyrus during performance of WM tasks. Furthermore, there are reports of a negative correlation between severe depressive symptoms and weaker fMRI response of left PFC in unaffected first\u2010degree relatives of probands with MDD (Watters, Carpenter, Harris, Korgaonkar, & Williams,\u00a0 ), and a positive correlation between depressive rumination and fMRI response of ACC in MDD (Gartner et al.,\u00a0 ), during performance of WM tasks. In addition, fMRI response in right DLPFC during a continuous performance WM task significantly predicted post\u2010treatment symptom improvement in MDD (Miller et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations in this meta\u2010analysis that should be acknowledged. First, due to the cross\u2010sectional design of all the studies included in the meta\u2010analysis it is not possible to determine causality. The alterations in brain function during performance of WM tasks in SZ and MDD relative to HC could therefore be either related to the cause (i.e., pathophysiology) or occur as a consequence of the disorders. However, since no effect of illness duration was observed in the meta\u2010regression analyses, the latter would appear to be the less likely interpretation. Second, the comparisons between patients with diagnosis of SZ and MDD and HC were based on spatial effect size maps reported in different published studies and the sample characteristics of the SZ and MDD groups not identical for all relevant clinical variables. For example, there was predicted to be an association between Auditory Verbal Hallucinations (AVHs) and cognitive processes underlying performance of WM tasks in SZ (Gisselgard et al.,\u00a0 ; Jenkins, Bodapati, Sharma, & Rosen,\u00a0 ). Well\u2010designed prospective studies with matching and controlling clinical variables will allow the potential effects of these variables on functional neuroimaging findings in patients with SZ and MDD to be more accurately compared. Third, there are inherent limitations in interview\u2010based and self\u2010reported scales for measuring clinical symptoms (such as PANSS and HAMD) (Aboraya & Nasrallah,\u00a0 ; Bagby, Ryder, Schuller, & Marshall,  ; Hamera, Schneider, Potocky, & Casebeer,\u00a0 ). Objectivity and reliability will be increased in future research by using screening methods based on biomarkers such as heart rate variability (Jung, Jang, & Lee,\u00a0 ; Koch, Wilhelm, Salzmann, Rief, & Euteneuer,  ; Schiweck, Piette, Berckmans, Claes, & Vrieze,\u00a0 ), electrodermal activity (Cella et al.,\u00a0 ; Kim et al.,\u00a0 ) and electroencephalogram\u2010based measures (Feuerriegel, Churches, Hofmann, & Keage,\u00a0 ; Spironelli, Romeo, Maffei, & Angrilli,\u00a0 ). Fourth, empirical simulations have suggested that at least 20 studies should be included in a meta\u2010analysis in order to obtain robust results (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). The present meta\u2010analysis includes 38 WM studies of patients with SZ and 20 WM studies of patients with MDD and so is consistent with the above guideline although the imbalanced numbers of studies relevant to each disorder could have potentially influenced the findings. Fifth, for the studies included in the meta\u2010analysis patients with SZ often showed poor performance in WM tasks relative to HC while patients with MDD generally showed comparable performance relative to HC, even in high task loads (i.e., 3 Back task). This difference in performance of WM tasks by patients with SZ and MDD can potentially bias the findings. Sixth, for most of the studies included in the meta\u2010analysis the patients with SZ and MDD were being treated with psychotropic medication at the time when fMRI investigations were performed, which could potentially influence the brain fMRI response that were observed (Schlagenhauf et al.,\u00a0 ). However, consistent with other studies (Kinou et al.,\u00a0 ; Phillips, Travis, Fagiolini, & Kupfer,\u00a0 ), evidence of an effect of the psychotropic medications on brain fMRI response was not revealed by the meta\u2010regression analyses performed in the present study for either patients with SZ or patients with MDD. Finally, the analysis was based on the coordinates of brain fMRI response reported in previously published studies rather than on the direct statistical analysis of acquired images (Salimi\u2010Khorshidi, Smith, Keltner, Wager, & Nichols,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nA systematic meta\u2010analysis of data from 52 published papers referring to 58 fMRI studies of WM tasks performed by patients with SZ (38 studies) and MDD (20 studies) revealed stronger fMRI response throughout the DMN in both disorders relative to HC, and the effects were of greater magnitude in SZ than MDD, especially in prefrontal\u2010temporal\u2010cingulate\u2010striatal\u2010cerebellar regions. In addition, a disorder\u2010specific weaker fMRI response was observed in right MFG in patients with MDD relative to HC. In both SZ and MDD the severity of clinical symptoms laterally influenced the brain fMRI response produced by WM tasks. These findings indicate that there may be common and distinct anomalies in brain function underlying deficits in WM in SZ and MDD, which may serve as a potential functional neuroimaging\u2010based diagnostic biomarker with value in supporting clinical diagnosis, measuring illness severity and assessing the efficacy of treatments for SZ and MDD at the brain level. Longitudinal studies recruiting first\u2010episode drug\u2010na\u00efve patients with SZ and MDD with uniform diagnosis and using MRI techniques such as those employed in the present study will assist in further elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying deficits in the performance of WM tasks in both disorders. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors have no potential conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nThe study was conceived by Xiuli Wang and Bochao Cheng.

Patients with this disease are often accompanied with cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of the cognitive impairment remains unclear. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a kind of magnetic resonance imaging method based on blood oxygen level dependence. This can reflect the spontaneous brain functional activity of a human brain in the resting state. In recent years, a number of researchers have used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the changes in resting spontaneous brain function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI). However, due to the differences in sample and methodology, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the resting spontaneous brain function in patients with TLE-CI through a meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nA search was conducted on electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANGFANG DATA and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Baidu scholar Database, from the establishment of the database to April 20, 2021.

This is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide.  However, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common refractory type of epilepsy, which refers to seizures that originate from the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and lateral temporal neocortex. Although under the control of anti-epileptic drugs, this can still affect human brain function in a slow and long-term manner. Furthermore, cognitive impairment is the major concern for these patients, such as damaging memory, attention, language, and executive control function.  But precise data on its incidence remains unclear.  At present, a number of studies have investigated the factors that contribute to cognitive dysfunction. It has been considered that these cognitive deficits are caused by complicated reasons, including anti-epileptic drugs, recurrent seizures, seizure severity, and organic brain disorders of the temporal lobe, seizure-induced head trauma, age of onset of epilepsy, and long duration of epilepsy.  However, the pathogenesis of the cognitive impairment remains unclear. \n\nIn patients with TLE, MRI studies have reported abnormal brain structures in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex,  thalamus,  and fornix.  Depending on voxel-based morphometry, white matter reductions ipsilateral to the seizure focus were also found in the temporopolar, entorhinal, and perirhinal areas.  Based on these studies, TLE originates unilaterally from the medial temporal lobe; they may be propagated from other regions which project to limbic areas. \n\nThe changes of whole brain function caused by epilepsy have also become a research hotspot. At present, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is being gradually applied in the diagnosis and research of epileptic brain function, providing neurophysiological and pathological evidence for the changes in brain function in epileptic patients. Among these, resting state fMRI has been extensively used to analyze the differences in activation characteristics of various brain regions in resting-state epilepsy patients and normal control groups through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF).  Various studies have investigated the resting-state networks in temporal lobe epilepsy with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) and TLE with the default mode network: activation of the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex in patients with verbal memory ; substantial decrease in activation in the neocortical, hippocampal, and parahippocampal regions in patients with 24-hour delayed verbal memory retrieval ; greater activation in the contralateral hippocampus in patients with worse memory performance.  However, the sample variables were small, and the results were inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a systematic review of the literature that evaluated the changes in brain functional activities in patients with TLE-CI in fMRI. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study registration \n  \nThis protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY). The registration number is INPLASY202130092 (Doi: 10.37766/inplasy2021.3.0092). The protocol is according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) statement guidelines.  The results of this meta-analysis will be published in a journal or conferences. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \n#### Types of participants \n  \nAdolescents and adult patients diagnosed with TLE (left or right) and cognitive impairment, according to any recognized diagnostic criteria, were included into the study. All participants were treated for their condition. \n\n\n\n### Types of study \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nRandomized controlled trials that compared the fMRI cerebral alterations in TLE of patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls; studies that reported the whole-brain results in 3-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) for changes in standard stereotactic space (Talairach or MNI); studies that used thresholds for significance corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds. \n\n\n#### Exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies that only reported findings in regions of interests; studies that used coordinates relative to the analysis that employed small volume corrections in pre-selected regions of interests. \n\n Types of interventions:   None. \n\n\n\n### Search methods for the identification of studies \n  \n#### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed in the following electronic databases, from the establishment of database to April 20, 2021: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANGFANG DATA and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Baidu scholar Database. Merely studies in the English and Chinese language were included for the study. \n\nThe following search terms were used: \u201cEpilepsy, Temporal Lobe\u201d, \u201cCognitive Dysfunction\u201d, \u201cNeurocognitive\u201d, \u201cDeterioration \u201d, \u201cDisorder \u201d, \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d, \u201cReHo\u201d, and \u201cALFF\u201d. The sample for the search strategy for PubMed is summarized in Table  . \n  \nSearch strategy for PubMed. \n  \n\n#### Selection of studies \n  \nThe EndNote X9 document management software was used to filter the articles. Two researchers independently and carefully browsed the selected articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reasons for the exclusion of articles was recorded, and any disagreements were resolved through the consensus of all authors. The diagram of the selection of studies is shown in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow chart. \n  \n\n\n### Data collection and analysis \n  \n#### Data extraction and management \n  \nTwo reviewers independently browsed the selected articles, and extracted and recorded the following information on Microsoft Excel: essential information: title, first author, publisher of the journal, year of publication, MRI type, and country; study design: inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization method, the definition of cognitive impairment, statistical analysis technique and patient characteristics, and sample size; participants: gender, age, and disease duration; results and conclusion. At all stages, any disagreement was resolved by discussion with a senior author. \n\n\n#### Data synthesis and statistical analysis \n  \nThe anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) software was used to analyze patients with TLE-CI and healthy controls through the ReHo or ALFFs between subjects. The peak coordinates in Talarach space were transformed into MNI space. In the experiment, if the result was a Z value, this was converted to the T value. AES-SDM was used to reconstruct the effect scales and statistical parameters for the increase and decrease in brain activation in each original study. \n\nThe Monte Carlo random number was set to 20. The full width at the half height of 20\u200amm was used to reconstruct the brain area difference map, and each voxel with a difference was given a corresponding weight value, which was as close as possible to the results of each study (if there were multiple assigned coordinates in a single study, the weighted value was adjusted). A meta-analysis was immediately performed after image reconstruction to calculate the voxel mass, with the statistical difference between TLE-CI patients and normal controls. In order to balance the sensitivity and specificity, the uncorrected   P  \u200a<\u200a.005 and voxel number \u226510 were used as the main thresholds. \n\n\n\n### Types of outcomes \n  \nSeparate analyses on functional brain response abnormalities were conducted using AES-SDM. This method uses the peak coordinates to recreate a statistical parametric map for each study. Then, a map would be created using the effect sizes of the differences between patients and controls, and a standard random-effects variance-weighted meta-analysis was conducted for each voxel. \n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias \n  \nThe methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool, Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The total score of the scale was 9 points. If the score of the included literature was >6 points, this would be included into the study, while if the score was <6 points, it was excluded. This process was independently completed by 2 professional researchers. In case of any disputes, this was discussed by 2 researchers or resolved by a third researcher. \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe Jack-knife sensitivity analysis method was used to confirm the repeatability of the results. That is, the statistical analysis was repeated, and a different dataset was removed each time. This tested the repeatability of the results. \n\n\n### Meta-regression or subgroup analysis \n  \nThe meta-linear regression analysis method based on AES-SDM was used to explore the influence of age and disease duration in TLE-CI patients on the research results. The threshold range of   P  \u200a<\u200a.005 was set, and merely brain regions with a significant correlation between spontaneous brain function changes, and age and disease duration were reported. Finally, if adequate trials would be included, the following potential sources of heterogeneity would be explored using subgroup analyses or meta-regression: studies with low risk of bias, when compared to trials with high risk of bias; methods: ALFF\\ReHo; scan T: 1.5\\3.0. \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nIf more than 10 studies were included, a funnel plot would be used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger or Begg test would be conducted to analyze the potential publication bias, and the results would be estimated based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. \n\n\n### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nNo human or animal subjects or samples were/will be used. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and will be disseminated at local and international neurology conferences. \n\n\n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nPatients were not involved in the development of the research question, outcome measures, and study design. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNowadays, the mechanism of TLE cognitive impairment has not been fully elucidated, and studies suggest that cognitive impairment is closely related to the abnormal brain structure and function of patients. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to observe the neural activities of various brain regions in the resting state, showing the interaction of brain neural networks. This paper aims to summarize the functional characteristics of the whole brain in patients with cognitive impairment of TLE, and to help us further understand the mechanism of cognitive impairment. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Qing Ye. \n\n Data curation:   Yiming Sun, Yuxuan Peng, Xueping Yang. \n\n Formal analysis:   Yu Dai. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Quan Wen. \n\n Investigation:   Xinru Liu, Qing Ye. \n\n Methodology:   Yuxuan Peng. \n\n Project administration:   Yiming Sun, Yu Dai. \n\n Software:   Yu Dai. \n\n Supervision:   Quan Wen. \n\n Validation:   Xinru Liu. \n\n Visualization:   Yiming Sun, Quan Wen. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Qing Ye. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Yiming Sun, Qing Ye. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8519237, "text_md5": "25baaa5bb8b3e135553df0164dbe5fd2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 125], "publication_year": [127, 131], "title": [142, 221], "keywords": [235, 325], "abstract": [338, 2226], "body": [2235, 13680]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34731102, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000027249", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8519237", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8519237"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8519237\">8519237</a>", "list_title": "PMC8519237  Resting-state fMRI in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with cognitive impairment"}

The major goal of this study was to systematically review and analyze the effects of real-time fMRI-Neurofeedback concerning the neuromodulation of the amygdala during Emotion Regulation training. A search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science with the following key terms: \u226a(\u201cneurofeedback\u201d or \u201cneuro feedback\u201d or \u201cneuro-feedback\u201d) and (\u201cemotion regulation\u201d) and (fMRI OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance\u201d),\u226b and afterwards two additional searches were performed, replacing the term \u201cemotion regulation\u201d for \u201camygdala\u201d and \u201cneurofeedback\u201d for \u201cfeedback.\u201d Of the 531 identified articles, only 19 articles reported results of amygdala modulation during Emotional Regulation training through rtfMRI-NF, using healthy participants or patients, in original research articles. The results, systematically reviewed here, provide evidence for amygdala's modulation during rtfMRI-NF training, although studies' heterogeneity precluded a quantitative meta-analysis\u2014the included studies relied on different outcome measures to infer the success of neurofeedback intervention. Thus, a qualitative analysis was done instead. We identified critical features influencing inference on the quality of the intervention as: the inclusion of a Practice Run, a Transfer Run and a Control Group in the protocol, and to choose adequate Emotion Regulation strategies\u2014in particular, the effective recall of autobiographic memories. Surprisingly, the Regulated vs. Control Condition was lacking in most of the studies, precluding valid inference of amygdala neuromodulation within Session. The best controlled studies nevertheless showed positive effects. The type of stimulus/interface did not seem critical for amygdala modulation. We also identified potential effects of lateralization of amygdala responses following Up- or Down-Regulation, and the impact of fMRI parameters for data acquisition and analysis. Despite qualitative evidence for amygdala modulation during rtfMRI-NF, there are still important limitations in the design of a clear conceptual framework of NF-training research. Future studies should focus on more homogeneous guidelines concerning design, protocol structure and, particularly, harmonized outcome measures to provide quantitative estimates of neuromodulatory effects in the amygdala. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotion Regulation (ER) plays a vital role in adaptive behavior. The ability to regulate emotional responses is essential in ensuring productivity in working environments and in social adaptation. Dysfunction in this ability is common in many of psychiatric diseases, including social anxiety disorder (Jazaieri et al.,  ), major depressive disorder (Yuan et al.,  ; Stephanou et al.,  ), eating disorders (Donofry et al.,  ), personality disorders (van Zutphen et al.,  ), or in autism spectrum disorders (Weiss et al.,  ). \n\nA better understanding of the neural underpinnings of ER processes is of great interest for the development of new therapeutic interventions. According to a cognitive control model of ER, its neural implementation can be summarized as resulting from the interactions of the prefrontal (PFC) and the anterior cingulate (ACC) cortical regions and their influence on subcortical structures, in particular the amygdala (Sergerie et al.,  ; Zilverstand et al.,  ; Stephanou et al.,  ). Despite the complex interactions within the ER network, it is widely accepted that the amygdala is a critical region for the generation, expression, and experience of emotions (LeDoux,  ; Duvarci and Pare,  ; Frank et al.,  ). Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting this structure are of major importance. \n\nNeurofeedback (NF) draws on multiple techniques that allows self-regulation enhancement of neural activity in health and disease. It implies the use of non-invasive training methods for the self-regulation of neural activity to alter neural plasticity and learning, by providing individuals with real time information about their brain responses (Sulzer et al.,  ; Stoeckel et al.,  ). These techniques continue to be a focal point of development of possible treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) has been revealed as a promising and useful clinical tool to enhance individual ER capability in neuropsychiatric disorders (Johnston et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl,  ;Emmert et al.,  ). \n\nImportantly, when assessing new therapeutic approaches, it is necessary to consider both general and disorder-specific deficits, in order to select the appropriate neural targets. For instance, when planning interventions targeting particular deficits or psychiatric symptoms related with dysregulation of emotional processes, fMRI-based NF can first use functional localizer scans that allow for a specific choice of target areas within the core regulatory network of ER (Johnston et al.,  ). However, given that the amygdala is easy to reliably identify from the anatomical point of view, a functional localizer is not mandatory in this case. \n\nTo date, several studies have demonstrated that individuals can enhance their ability to modulate their own brain activity, by using rtfMRI-NF approaches that target networks that are relevant to voluntary ER (Paret et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ). Most studies that address the modulation of the emotional network, define the amygdala as the main target (Costafreda et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Keynan et al.,  ) based on evidence that ER involves the modulation of amygdala activity (Ochsnet et al.,  ). Accordingly, several studies that did not use rtfMRI, have addressed the importance of the amygdala during ER and cognitive reappraisal of emotion (e.g., Sarkheil et al.,  ; for a meta-analysis see Buhle et al.,  ) and mood induction (e.g., Dyck et al.,  ; Kohn et al.,  ). The success of interventions focusing the control of brain areas during ER training, including the amygdala, would provide confirmatory information that one's emotional state, at least to some extent, is capable of being modulated, and this might have an important clinical impact. \n\nHowever, there has been some controversy around the results reported thus far, due to heterogeneity among studies in terms of outcome measures, characteristics of the applied protocol, or the included participants (Sulzer et al.,  ; Thibault et al.,  ), further extended by the debate on what constitutes a proper control condition (Sorger et al.,  ). Commonly, NF training protocols include a recorded Baseline of brain activity, sometimes followed by a Localizer Run (to functionally define the target Region-of-interest (ROI) unless an anatomically defined ROI is chosen (Sulzer et al.,  ), or when data-driven approaches are not used instead (e.g., LaConte et al.,  ; LaConte,  ) and Training Runs. During the Training Runs, the participant practices the ER task with feedback of the brain signal in real time. Particularly, the participant should apply ER strategies to increase (Up-Regulate) or decrease (Down-Regulate) the activation of the targeted brain region (Stoeckel et al.,  ). In some studies, a Practice Run precedes the NF Training Runs. Moreover, studies may also include a Transfer Run at the end of one or multiple Sessions (Sulzer et al.,  ). In this Transfer Run, the participant is instructed to regulate brain activation as in prior Training Runs, but without receiving any feedback (Zotev et al.,  ; Sulzer et al.,  ; Stoeckel et al.,  ). In these cases, the Transfer Run is included in the protocols to understand if the participant can learn to self-regulate the target brain region's activity without NF (Zotev et al.,  ; Stoeckel et al.,  ) and to translate it for the outside world (Sulzer et al.,  ). Most studies employ only a single Session, but NF training can be performed throughout several Sessions (Sulzer et al.,  ), which allows for mental training between Sessions (Subramanian et al.,  ; Sulzer et al.,  ) and positive carry-over effects (Rieger et al.,  ). \n\nBesides the heterogeneity of NF studies in terms of protocols and outcome measures, it is important to identify other factors that may affect such outcomes when using the amygdala as the target region. For instance, the known rapid habituation of this structure even to emotionally loaded faces (Breiter et al.,  ) may represent a limitation in NF approaches because it limits the potential for neuromodulation. In addition, echoplanar imaging (EPI) of this region is known to create susceptibility-induced magnetic field inhomogeneities with consequent signal loss and geometric distortion (Merboldt et al.,  ; Olman et al.,  ). Several studies have tested optimizations for fMRI sequences targeting the amygdala, and reported optimal values in terms of echo time (TE), voxel size, slice thickness and section orientation (Merboldt et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Posse et al.,  , ; Robinson et al.,  ,  ; Morawetz et al.,  ; Olman et al.,  ). All these approaches have tradeoffs that need to be carefully considered when estimating final signal to noise ratios, and statistical effect sizes. Some authors advise the use of multi-echo instead of single-echo acquisitions when measuring amygdala activation (Posse et al.,  , ), as it increases sensitivity to the BOLD response through a better contrast-to-noise ratio (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ). However, this may imply limited brain volume coverage (Posse et al.,  ). But method studies using single-echo EPI acquisitions have also reported good results (e.g., (Kirilina et al.,  )), while others have suggested the reduction of section thickness to improve the detectability of amygdala activation (Bellgowan et al.,  ; Morawetz et al.,  ). The use of shorter repetition times (TRs) to minimize physiological signal confounds such as blood pulsation in Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal changes (Posse et al.,  , ; Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ) has also been suggested but again at the cost of full brain coverage (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ), as well as possibly introducing other unwanted noise (Zhao et al.,  ). \n\nImportantly, data denoising methods should be considered in advance, with concomitant measurements of physiological signals such as heart and respiratory rate during the rtfMRI-NF data acquisition (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ). By improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), through the reduction of both instrumental and physiological noise, relative effect sizes increase and consequently, sensitivity becomes improved. The use of techniques such as parallel imaging acceleration (e.g., SENSE, sensitivity encoding; and GRAPPA, generalized autocalibrating partially parallel Acquisition) (Blaimer et al.,  ; Bhavsar et al.,  ) to reduce the costs of EPI\u2014geometric distortion and signal loss\u2014in regions such as the amygdala (Olman et al.,  ; Bhavsar et al.,  ) is becoming more common, particularly in rtfMRI-NF. Although these techniques may impact SNR (Olman et al.,  ), technological improvements and the use of arrayed instead of birdcage coils (de Zwart et al.,  ; Bellgowan et al.,  ) have shown enhancement of temporal SNR (tSNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in medial temporal regions (Bellgowan et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, given its cost and complexity, it is crucial to demonstrate how rtfMRI-NF training can produce novel ER related task strategies for practical applications. It is therefore important to systematically review and analyze the effectiveness of this technique in the modulation of specific target areas, as well as effects sizes (Rogala et al.,  ). Additionally, the study of specific brain activity patterns related to ER may help elucidate further about its neural underpinnings. Consequently, it motivates the optimization of rtfMRI-NF techniques for the training of ER abilities. \n\nHere, we systematically reviewed the reported evidence of regulating amygdala activity with rtfMRI-NF during ER training. Given the potential relevance of NF in basic and clinical neuroscience of ER and its possible therapeutic application in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, the major goal of this review is to systematically assess and analyze the effects of rtfMRI-NF in the neuromodulation of the amygdala during ER training. We aimed to collect evidence from available studies that reported changes in brain activity and to discuss the reported effectiveness of this technique. \n\nThe main objectives of this revision were: (1) the definition (characteristics) of NF protocols and (2) how the amygdala responds to ER training using rtfMRI-NF? Particularly, in the first point, we asked: (1.1) What were the outcome measures used among studies? (1.2) Were there sustained brain changes in the amygdala as a result of rtfMRI-NF neuromodulation across training runs (within the same Session)? (1.3) Were there sustained brain changes as a result of rtfMRI-NF neuromodulation training across different Sessions? (1.4) Were the brain changes only visible in the training group (compared to the control group)? and (1.5) Did the training effect depend on amygdala lateralization? In the second point, we defined questions as: (2.1) Which stimuli were used to induce emotional states and how effective were they? (2.2) Which ER strategies were the participants instructed to use and how effective were they? (2.3) How do fMRI acquisition, preprocessing and data analysis parameters relate to the training effects? (2.4) Was there any potential bias created by the NF protocols? \n\nTo answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review to analyze the potential quantitative and qualitative associations between the studies' characteristics and their reported results. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \n#### Data Sources and Literature Search \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that have investigated the training of ER through rtfMRI-NF, and to measure these training effects on amygdala blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. This review was performed following the principles of the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al.,  ; Moher et al.,  ). This process underlies four phases: identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion ( ). The research papers selected and reviewed in this study were identified through a search in the following databases: MEDLINE, via PubMed ( ), Science Direct (Elsevier,  ), and Web of Science ( ). First, the following search string was used: (\u201cneurofeedback\u201d OR \u201cneuro feedback\u201d OR \u201cneuro-feedback\u201d), (\u201cemotion regulation\u201d), and (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance\u201d). Afterwards, a second search was performed using the same combination of keywords but replacing \u201cemotion regulation\u201d with \u201camygdala,\u201d in order to cover articles that presented data on amygdala responses to training in ER with NF, but using terms other than \u201cemotion regulation.\u201d Finally, a third search string was used, considering \u201cemotion regulation,\u201d (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance\u201d), and using \u201cfeedback\u201d instead of \u201cneurofeedback.\u201d \n  \nFlow diagram. Flow of information describing the different phases of the systematic review. \n  \nThe search reported here was undertaken in September 2018, without imposing any publication date limit. Therefore, it includes articles published up to September 2018. In addition, references included in the articles deemed appropriate for full text revision were hand-searched to retrieve further relevant publications. \n\n\n#### Eligibility Criteria, Screening Phase, and Study Selection \n  \nStudies adhering to the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) written in English; (2) involving adult human participants (animal studies were excluded); (3) involving original research articles (e.g., review articles were excluded); (4) applied rtfMRI-NF training (and not other forms of Neurofeedback, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback or others), (5) directly addressed \u201cemotion regulation\u201d as the target cognitive process to modulate (and not other cognitive process), (6) made direct and separate measurements in the amygdala (either this is defined or not as the target region). \n\nThe study selection was performed in two different stages: a screening phase, in which titles and abstracts were analyzed and studies filtered based on the eligibility criteria, and a final selection phase, in which the full texts were analyzed. During the screening phase, duplicates were eliminated. \n\n\n#### Data Extraction \n  \nFrom the final set of papers included, the extraction and categorization of the following detailed features was performed ( \u2013 , ) regarding   design and participants  : (1)   study design  , considering two variables: the Up-Regulation/Down-Regulation of amygdala activity; and the existence of a Control Group (whether or not a Control Group was used and if in that group a sham-feedback or no feedback was used). The use of a Control Group does not always refer to sham-NF, as the study may use a Control Group without providing feedback, real or fake\u2014we made this distinction in the reporting of results; (2)   participants' characterization   (sample size, age, gender distribution, exclusion criteria applied for recruitment) and, in particular, the study population\u2014if patients or healthy controls; regarding the   NF protocol  : (3)   instruction   (whether or not there was an ER strategy applied and if there was a previous practice task), (4)   stimuli   (the type of stimuli presented and if stimuli were previously tested for selection), (5)   feedback interface   [type of feedback display\u2014visual, or other type; the feedback source signal\u2014traditional activation studies that used a region-of-interest (ROI) or studies that focused on feedback based on connectivity measures or the classification of distributed patterns of activity, e.g., Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA); in cased where ROIs were used, we specified the feedback ROI]; (6)   protocol design   (the number of NF Training Runs, Practice Run, Transfer Run, and Sessions); (7)   data acquisition parameters   and/or measures [scanner, in-plane voxel resolution, slice thickness, TR, TE that specified single or multi-echo acquisition, flip angle (FA), physiological measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate) and quality control measures] and (8)   data analysis  , that specified online/real-time and offline/  post-hoc   procedures in terms of preprocessing (slice time correction, motion correction, drift/artifacts removal, distortion correction), spatial smoothing (mm), and template (coordinate space), as well as method of statistical analysis used in real time and in post-processing [e.g., General Linear Model (GLM), correlation analysis]. Data concerning the quantitative results were then collected and summarized ( , ). Importantly, only direct contrasts (  t  -tests,   Z  -tests) and correlations between Conditions/Runs/Sessions were reported (main or interaction effects were not included in the analysis, with only   post-hoc   tests of these effects being considered). For data visualization, a summary of the results is presented in  \u2013  5  . Modulation of amygdala activity was considered whenever at least one of the contrasts within studies presented in   or   reported significant statistical results. \n  \nStudy characteristics and design. \n  \n List of included articles with data extraction.

Therefore, a qualitative review of the studies satisfying inclusion criteria was performed instead. \n\nWe reviewed studies regarding the amygdala response to the NF training and the differences in the methodology used in these studies, by extracting and summarizing (a) Study characteristics\u2014study design, neurofeedback protocol features, and data acquisition parameters, and (b) Amygdala modulation\u2014how data acquisition parameters, study design, and neurofeedback protocol features relate to results. The following characteristics and points were analyzed: Exclusion criteria, Single vs. Multiple Sessions, Experimental vs. Control Group, rtfMRI-NF protocol design, Transfer Run and Practice Run, Stimuli, Emotion Regulation Strategies, Data acquisition parameters, and Amygdala lateralization. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nThe review of the literature using search items as described above identified 531 potential target articles (84 identified via the PUBMED database, 323 through Science Direct and 117 via Web of Science). \n\nIn the first stage of selection, 484 papers were excluded ( ), following the previously defined inclusion criteria (1) to (6) (section Eligibility Criteria, Screening Phase, and Study Selection): 122 were duplicated records, 191 were reviews or non-original research articles, 111 were not rtfMRI-NF based studies, 55 did not address the training of ER processes, 20 did not make direct and separate measurements in the amygdala, and two were not written in English. Thus, 46 articles were selected for full text analysis. After carefully evaluating all the experimental paradigms used, in a second selection stage we excluded 27 more articles for the following reasons: three studies consisted of a new analysis approach made to the same experimental paradigm previously described in another paper already included in our pool, showing no new quantitative results for the BOLD activity in amygdala during NF; 15 showed no quantitative results regarding modulation of amygdala's activity as a training effect; five did not use the BOLD signal as the NF source in the protocol; and the remaining four dealt with \u201cEEG Finger-Print\u201d analysis-based NF, with pre and post-training fMRI data but featured an EEG-based NF protocol. \n\nFinally, 19 articles were selected for further quantitative analysis. These referred to 19 studies that used rtfMRI-NF protocols to train ER and presented quantitative results regarding amygdala responses. The characterization of studies, NF protocols and data acquisition parameters are described in detail in the Tables and summarized in the Figures. \n\n\n### Feasibility of Quantitative Analysis \n  \nEfforts were made in order to find a common and comparable statistical outcome measure to attempt a meta-analysis of the main effects. However, the large heterogeneity of analysis approaches found in the set of reports precluded such strategy. A large array of different statistical outcome measures among studies were found, reporting the effects of NF training based on 23 different variable contrasts that were reported (by outcome measure we refer here to the specific contrasts between the variables or conditions employed by the authors to measure the effect of ER in amygdala BOLD signal). A selection of the most representative outcome measures is reported in  , . Because of the variability in the statistical measurements of amygdala modulation, requisites for a valid meta-analysis were not present. Therefore, a non-quantitative analysis of the results and protocol features was performed. \n\n\n### Non-quantitative Analysis \n  \nThe next subsections will focus on the qualitative analysis performed regarding the selected descriptive features of the included studies, NF protocols and reported results. First, the study characteristics and rtfMRI-NF protocol variations will be described in the subsection \u201c  Study characteristics\u2014study design, neurofeedback protocol features and data acquisition parameters  .\u201d Second, considering these features, a comparative analysis of the contrasts testing modulation of amygdala activity will be described in the subsection \u201c  Amygdala modulation\u2014how data acquisition parameters, study design, and neurofeedback protocol features relate with results  .\u201d \n\n\n### Study Characteristics\u2014Participants, Study Design, Neurofeedback Protocol Features, and Data Acquisition Parameters \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nAmong the selected studies, 13 (68.42%) were neuroscience studies (Posse et al.,  ; Johnston et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ), and six (31.58%) are clinically focused (Young et al.,  ,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ). Two studies addressed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Nicholson et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ), one study focused on Borderline Personality Disorder (Paret et al.,  ) and three studies described a sample of subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Young et al.,  ,  ; Zotev et al.,  ). \n\nIn terms of sample characteristics, the age ranges varied between 18 and 55. Sample size ranged from 6 to 42 subjects. Gender distribution was uneven: four studies presented a sample with females exclusively (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ,  ) and four studies considered only males (Zotev et al.,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Exclusion Criteria \n  \nConcerning the selection of participants, often, non-overlapping exclusion criteria for participants were applied among studies: (a) History of neurological or psychiatric disease, (b) not being right-handed (handedness is taken as a rough measure of hemispheric dominance to ensure sample homogeneity, and reduce confounds), (c) non-compliance with fMRI standards, such as \u201cgeneral contraindications against MRI examinations\u201d (Zotev et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ), \u201cgeneral MRI exclusions/incompatibilities\u201d (Young et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ), which related to the \u201cMRI safety standards\u201d (Nicholson et al.,  ), and \u201cphysical conditions that prevent lying comfortably inside an MRI scanner\u201d (Marxen et al.,  ); (d) alcohol/drug abuse, and (e) absence of normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Nine of the studies (47.37%) used three or more of these criteria (Zotev et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Li et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ), four studies (21.05%) used two of the mentioned criteria (Posse et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ), four studies (21.05%) used only one exclusion criteria (Johnston et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Zotev et al.,  ) and two did not describe the applied exclusion criteria (Zotev et al.,  ,  ). From these criteria, (a) was the most frequently used (considered in 16 of the studies\u221284.21%), secondly (c) (eight studies\u221242.11%), followed by (d) and (b) (seven studies each\u221236.84%), and finally (e) being the least used criterion (only four studies\u221221.05%). \n\n\n#### Single vs. Multiple Sessions \n  \nOnly six studies (31.58%) had more than one NF training Session, three studies used three Sessions (Koush et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ) and two studies performed four Sessions (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Experimental vs. Control Group \n  \nIn the study design, in nine of the reports (47.37%), authors decided not to use a Control Group (Posse et al.,  ; Johnston et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Zotev et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ), against 11 (57.89%) who did. Seven (36.84%) used a Control Group with a sham-NF approach (Paret et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ) and three (15.79%) gave no feedback to the participants of the Control Group (Sarkheil et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ). As for the selection of participants' study arm, the great majority of the studies did not describe their approach\u2014only six studies (31.58%) reported a blind and randomized selection process (Zotev et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ;Hellrung et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### fMRI Protocol Design \n  \nMost studies applied a block design for the ER task, alternating regulate and rest blocks. In this type of design, volunteers were required to regulate their BOLD signal for one period (Regulate Condition) followed by a rest block. In three study cases (15.79%) rest blocks consisted of presenting emotional stimuli to the participants, without any instruction regarding regulation (View Condition). In 12 studies (63.16%), apart from the View condition, the protocol also included a third block in which the participants were either asked to perform a counting task or were exposed to neutral stimuli with no emotional content (Neutral Condition) or to a Rest block (without any task to perform). For data analysis purposes in this review, Rest blocks (View, Neutral, or Rest Conditions) were considered overall as the \u201cControl Condition\u201d. The Control Condition blocks are generally used to obtain a baseline of the BOLD activity. Baseline values are subsequently used as a reference for the detection of BOLD signal changes, by comparing it with the signal measured during the Regulate Condition. In terms of trial duration on the Regulation blocks (which included the Regulate Condition), variations occurred between 4.5 and 46 s of stimulus display. However, in most of the protocols (78.95%), the Regulate trial lasted between 20 and 46 s and in only 15.79% of the cases the trial lasted <20 s (Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ). The number of trials in a Regulation block varied from three to 12 trials per block, with one study having 240 trials in the same (and only) experimental block (Posse et al.,  ). \n\nOnly two articles mentioned considering amygdala habituation effects and described strategies to prevent it: (1) the pictures were randomized and 50% of the pictures were unseen prior to the study (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ), and (2) the order of presentation was pseudorandomized, with no image being presented more than once to the participants (Koush et al.,  ). \n\nFive studies (26.32%) were about amygdala Down-Regulation, 9 (47.37%) about amygdala Up-Regulation, four studies attempted both Up- and Down-Regulation of amygdala activity and one study investigated top-down connectivity regulation between amygdala and other regions of the ER neural circuitry (see  ). \n\nFeedback sources also differed across studies. Seventeen of the 19 studies (89.47%) assessed the % of BOLD signal change in a specific target ROI as the feedback source, while two other studies used distinct sources: in one study participants' emotional states (positive or negative) were given to them as feedback but with these states being classified using MVPA\u2014Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis of functional imaging data (Li et al.,  ), whereas a second study used a connectivity feedback approach (Koush et al.,  ). In the study of Li et al. ( ), MVPA provided a binary classification (positive or negative emotion) based on the decoding of distributed brain signals across multiple voxels. Such MVPA classification was then used as feedback for the participants. MVPA investigates the information contained in distributed patterns of neural activity and it is considered as a supervised classification method where a classifier attempts to capture the relationships between spatial pattern of fMRI activity and experimental conditions (in this case positive or negative emotions). \n\nIn the study of Koush et al. ( ), the goal of the NF training was to strengthen the top-down connectivity from the dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dmPFC) onto the bilateral amygdala. The connectivity-based NF signal was calculated using a real-time Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) approach based on the time courses of three ROIs (dmPFC, left and right amygdala). DCM is a Bayesian framework for modeling effective brain connectivity. The feedback display consisted of a logarithmic Bayes factor value (which was red if the trial was successful, i.e., positive, and blue otherwise). This value included the cumulative reward that had been earned until then. During the NF training, the participants learned to voluntarily increase top-down effective connectivity from the dmPFC onto the bilateral amygdala. This was accomplished by providing a feedback signal that indicated the degree of dominance of a top-down model (target model for training) compared with a bottom-up model. If the top-down model fit the ongoing brain activity during a training trial better than the bottom-up model, the feedback signal was positive; if the bottom-up model dominated, the feedback signal was negative. NF training was therefore focused on up-regulating positive emotions. In other words, if the logarithmic Bayes factor was positive, the participant was rewarded for a successful trial. Importantly, the feedback signal calculation for a NF trial was based on the entire ROI time series of this trial, including baseline and Regulate Conditions. After each repetition of the five baseline and the four Regulation blocks, participants were given the chance to rest for 38 s. Afterwards, participants were presented with feedback about their success for 4 s. Feedback was therefore intermittent and slow. \n\nFrom the 17 studies that defined a specific brain region as the feedback target, and not a connectivity approach (89.47%), five studies (29.41%) defined bilateral amygdala (Johnston et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ) as the feedback ROI; seven studies (41.18%) used only the left amygdala (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ), whereas three studies used only the right amygdala (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ). One study defined another brain region as the target ROI (lateral PFC) while analyzing modulation in the amygdala (Sarkheil et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Transfer Run and Practice Run \n  \nSimilarly, there was a lot of variability concerning the NF protocol features. Eleven studies (57.89%) included a Transfer Run in the protocol design (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ) to determine whether or not the participants were able to demonstrate enhanced brain activation or other behavioral effects when feedback is no longer available. Regarding the Practice Run, only eight studies (42.11%) included a run in which the participants could practice the regulation strategy task without receiving any kind of feedback, before the NF runs (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nRegarding the stimuli, 9 studies did not present any kind of stimuli to their participants to induce an emotional state, eight studies (42.11%) used picture stimuli, one study used (aversive) words (Nicholson et al.,  ) and one other study used music tracks (Lorenzetti et al.,  ). Six (31.57%) of the studies employing pictures used aversive pictures (Johnston et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ) and the two other studies used negative emotional faces of the same gender and emotional valence (Posse et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ). \n\nOf the studies employing stimuli, seven studies (70%) did not report performing any type of previous stimuli assessment in terms of emotion induction potential, whereas three studies described a pre-assessment of arousal and valence of the stimuli (before the experiment) (Johnston et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ). In two of the cases the assessment was made with the same participants as the main task. Finally, three studies reported a post-assessment of arousal and valence of the stimuli (after training), with the same participants performing the NF main task (Paret et al.,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n#### Localizer Run \n  \nOnly three studies reported the use of a functional localizer run to define the NF target ROI online (Johnston et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Emotion Regulation Strategies \n  \nConcerning the application of ER strategies, not all of the studies explicitly instructed their participants to use a defined ER strategy. Indeed, in 10 of the studies (52.63%) the authors told the participants to use a free ER strategy, meaning that no defined strategy was required (Posse et al.,  ; Johnston et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ). Only two studies (10.53%) considered the use of cognitive ER strategies: Cognitive Reappraisal (Sarkheil et al.,  ) and Reality Checking (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ). The other seven studies (36.84%) instructed participants to Recall Autobiographic Memories (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition Parameters \n  \nRegarding the data acquisition parameters, the majority of studies (94.74%) were conducted using 3T MRI equipment. Respecting EPI parameters, in-plane resolution ranged between 1.8 \u00d7 1.8 and 6.25 \u00d7 6.25 mm , and slice thickness between 1.8 and 3.75 mm. Relatively low variability was found in TR (14 studies with TR = 2,000 ms, one study with TR > 2,000 ms and four studies with TR < 2,000 ms) and TE (from the 19 studies that reported this information, 14 defined a TE = 30 ms, and three studies defined TE \u2264 25 ms) values. Only two studies (Posse et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ) used multi-echo acquisition to improve BOLD sensitivity using a TE range of 8.6\u201357 ms and of 12\u2013140 ms, respectively. \n\nAll the studies used axial or near-axial slice orientation except for four studies, in which this information was lacking (Johnston et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ). Of the 17 studies that reported FA, nine studies used a 90\u00b0 angle, whereas the other eight reported FAs equal or inferior to 82\u00b0 ( ). \n\nOf the 19 studies included, 11 employed parallel imaging acceleration for image reconstruction. Three studies used GRAPPA (Koush et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ); and the other eight studies used SENSE (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ). Of the studies employing parallel imaging, only one used this technique combined with multi-echo acquisition (Marxen et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Online and Offline Data Processing \n  \nDifferent online data processing steps and parameters were reported across the reviewed studies. For ROI definition, eight studies considered the coordinates given by previous functional neuroimaging studies (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ), four studies applied an anatomical mask (Li et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ), two studies functionally defined the ROI using pictures from an international validated system (Johnston et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ), and one study used a mask obtained through anatomical parcellation (Marxen et al.,  ). The ROI sphere diameter varied across studies from 5 to 20 mm, although seven studies did not report this parameter. Four of the studies that reported ROI size referred a diameter between 5 and 9 mm, and eight studies reported a diameter larger than 10 mm (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,   Young et al.,  ,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ). The different methods for extraction of the BOLD signal reported across studies were: using a percentage of the signal changes related to a baseline, applying a beta-values discrimination method, a GLM calculation, using event-related averaging of ROI, using a sliding window correlation analysis, and applying the Bayesian model. The majority of these studies (12 studies) reported using a percentage of signal change in relation to baseline, which was defined as the rest condition in all cases ( ). \n\nBoth online and offline data preprocessing methods applied among studies were ( ): (1) Slice timing correction, (2) Head motion correction, (3) Drift / artifact removal, (4) EPI distortion correction, and (5) Spatial smoothing. During online preprocessing, motion correction was applied in all studies whereas spatial smoothing was only reportedly applied online in four of the 19 studies (Paret et al.,  ,  ; Li et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ) but in all the studies during   post-hoc   analysis. EPI distortion correction was applied only once online (Marxen et al.,  ) whereas three studies reported offline EPI distortion correction (Koush et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ) or at least distortion inspection (Lorenzetti et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Amygdala Modulation\u2014How Data Acquisition Parameters, Study Design, and Neurofeedback Protocol Features Relate With Results \n  \n#### Clinical vs. Non-clinical Population \n  \nBoth studies that focused on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder showed significant results of amygdala modulation when comparing its activation patterns for Regulate Condition vs. Control Condition, during the Transfer Run. \n\nRegarding the sample of subjects diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, no significant results were reported. Interestingly, the same protocol was administered to a sample of healthy subjects and described in a previous paper from the same authors (Paret et al.,  ), with significant results on right amygdala modulation during the Transfer Run. \n\nConcerning Major Depressive Disorder, all three studies reported significant differences in left amygdala modulation during the regulation condition between the Last Run and the Transfer Run. Only one of the studies (Zotev et al.,  ) reported an effect of condition in the Transfer Run, and no differences between conditions were found in the Last Run for the experimental group, and no differences between conditions in the Transfer Run for the Control Group. \n\n\n#### Single vs. Multiple Sessions \n  \nConsidering a single Session ( ), 12 in 19 studies showed significant differences in the percentage (%) of BOLD signal change in the amygdala in at least one of the following variable contrasts, defined by each author as an outcome measure: Regulate Condition vs. Control Condition, in the First Run, Last Run and Transfer Run; First Run vs. Last Run; Transfer Run vs. Last Run; and Experimental Group vs. Control Group. In the studies that applied more than one NF training Session, only two studies reported a significant main effect of Session [(Br\u00fchl et al.,  ):   F   = 4.771,   p   = 0.021, (Young et al.,  ):   F   = 2.37,   p   = 0.04]. \n\n\n#### Experimental vs. Control Group \n  \nConcerning group effects, there were five studies addressing the contrast between Experimental Group and Control Group ( ). Two of these studies presented significant results of this contrast during the Last Run and four during the Transfer Run. \n\nIn the 10 studies that applied the protocol to a Control Group, only two of them reported the statistical outcome measures of the same contrasts within both the Control Group and the Experimental Group, with five studies reporting statistical outcomes from the contrast between Experimental Group and Control Group. Three studies (Zotev et al.,  ,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ) reported significant differences between Groups but did not report data relative to the contrast between runs or conditions within the Control Group, which is a critical omission ( ). \n\nTwo studies (Paret et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ) reported significant differences in the contrast between conditions in the Transfer Run in the Experimental Group but not in the Control Group, which supports the hypothesis of NF training related effects ( ). \n\n\n#### fMRI-NF Protocol Design \n  \nTen data records reported the contrast between conditions (Regulate Condition and Control Condition) within the Experimental Group to address results on successful modulation: seven in the Transfer Run, two in the First Run and three in the Last Run. From these, seven records (36.84%) showed significant differences between conditions in the amygdala response ( ). \n\nFrom the seven studies that reported no significant results in amygdala modulation in the considered contrasts (36.84%), two of them were about Down-Regulation, two were about amygdala Up-Regulation, two were about both Up- and Down-regulation and one was about top-down connectivity regulation (  Figure 4  ). \n\nStudies that used a connectivity or MVPA approach to the feedback source did not report significant effects regarding amygdala modulation. These new methods do therefore remain exploratory and their real face value remains to be confirmed. In contrast, significant results on amygdala modulation were found in at least one of the reported measures in 11 (57.89%) of the studies that used % of BOLD signal change and had a predefined ROI as a feedback source. \n\n\n#### Localizer Run \n  \nThe two studies (Johnston et al.,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ) that used localizer runs to define a target ROI in the amygdala reported significant amygdala modulation in at least one of the measures ( , ). The other study that used a functional localizer but defined the target ROI in the left lateral PFC (Sarkheil et al.,  ) also reported significant effects in the amygdala ROI (spherical ROI centered in coordinates). \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nFrom the seven studies that presented non-significant results in amygdala modulation in the considered contrasts, four of them used aversive pictures as stimuli for emotion induction and three did not use any stimulus during the training protocol. Two of the studies with non-significant results in amygdala modulation applied stimuli pre-assessment and two applied stimuli post-assessment. From the 9 studies that used no stimuli for emotion induction, six reported significant effects in amygdala modulation ( ). \n\n\n#### Emotion Regulation Strategies \n  \nFrom the two studies that considered induced cognitive ER strategies, the one that used Cognitive Reappraisal reported no significant effects in amygdala modulation, whereas the one that used Reality Checking reported significant effects. Six in seven studies that instructed the participants to Recall Autobiographic Memories reported evidence of amygdala modulation. From the six studies that reported non-significant results on amygdala modulation, four studies instructed the participants with a free ER strategy ( ). \n  \nEmotion regulation strategy and amygdala modulation results. \n  \n\n#### Amygdala Lateralization \n  \nFrom the 19 included records, 8 studies found significant responses in the left amygdala and six studies found the same response pattern in the right amygdala. It is important to point out that one study (Zotev et al.,  ) showed a training effect in the left and right amygdala but a significant group effect only in the left amygdala. In another study (Young et al.,  ), there were training effects only for left amygdala and group effects only for right amygdala. One of the studies (Zotev et al.,  ) more directly addressed amygdala lateralization by revealing a positive association between the frontal EEG asymmetry in upper alpha band during NF training (Happy vs. Rest condition) and the average BOLD amygdala laterality. Furthermore, one of the studies (Paret et al.,  ) showed a main effect of hemisphere [  F   = 19.012,   p   < 0.001]. \n\nAmong the 8 studies that reported LA significant responses, five were about Up-Regulation of the brain region's activity, two were about Up- and Down-Regulation and only one was about Down-Regulation. In contrast, from the six studies that reported RA significant responses, three were about Down-Regulation and three about Up-Regulation ( ). \n  \nNumber of studies on up-regulation, down-regulation, up and down-regulation and amygdala lateralized response. LA, Left amygdala; RA, Right amygdala. \n  \n\n#### Data Acquisition Parameters \n  \nStudies that did not report significant results in any of the contrasts related to amygdala modulation were identified and screened to find a common study/protocol/data acquisition or analysis. We found no common feature in any of the previously mentioned domains for the seven studies. Nevertheless, it is possible to point to differences in protocol features in three of the non-significant results' studies when comparing these with studies that reported significant outcomes. Study #5 (Li et al.,  ) reported one of the highest values of slice thickness [3.5 mm\u2014although Lorenzetti et al. ( ) used 3.75 mm and found a significant contrast]. Three in four of the studies reporting non-significant results in all the considered contrasts (Studies #4, #10, #12) also presented atypical data acquisition parameters values in relation to the successful studies (Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ), namely, a TR < 2,000 ms (TR = 1,100 ms; TR = 1,000 ms and TR = 1,500 ms; respectively). Additionally, one of the studies that reported non-significant amygdala modulation outcomes (Koush et al.,  ) reported the smallest in-plane resolution (1.8 \u00d7 1.8 mm) ( ). \n  \nNumber of studies by statistical output concerning fMRI data acquisition parameters. \n  \nRegarding FA, seven (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ; Hellrung et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ) of the nine studies that used a FA of 90\u00b0 reported significant results in at least one of the contrast measures ( , ), but only three (Posse et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ) in nine when FAs below 85\u00b0 were used ( ;  ). \n\nOf the 12 studies with significant amygdala modulation in at least one of the measures, seven studies (#1, #6 #14, #16, #17, #18, #19) used parallel imaging acceleration (particularly, SENSE). These results are quite preliminary and the relation of this parameter with neuromodulation effects in the amygdala remain unclear (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ) ( ). \n\n\n#### Online and Offline Data Processing \n  \nImportantly, none of the studies that used anatomical templates or anatomical parcellations to define the ROI for real-time NF reported significant results of amygdala modulation in any of the contrasts. Moreover, from the 12 studies that reported significant amygdala modulation, one of the studies defined the target ROI for rtfMRI-NF with a diameter length between 5 and 9 mm, while seven of the studies reported a diameter between 14 and 20 mm. \n\nFinally, all studies applied motion correction methods during online and offline pre-processing of fMRI data. Concerning reporting on online spatial smoothing, the same number of studies (2) with or without significant result, was found. On the other hand, only one of four studies that applied offline spatial smoothing of 8 mm reported significant amygdala modulation ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe systematically reviewed and analyzed the effects of rtfMRI-NF concerning neuromodulation of the amygdala during ER training. The efficacy of rtfMRI-NF training for amygdala's modulation in the reviewed studies was evaluated by comparing % of BOLD signal change in the targeted region using different and various outcome measures across studies, in addition to evaluating behavioral performance and psychometric outcome measures, which was not the focus of our review. In general, we found evidence for amygdala modulation during rtfMRI-NF training, although the use of different outcome measures across studies to infer on the success of NF intervention precluded a quantitative meta-analysis. This was nevertheless an important conclusion to report. \n\nIn the next sections, the results will be discussed using as guideline the research questions defined in the Introduction section. \n\nMain question: \u201cHow does the amygdala respond to emotion regulation training using neurofeedback?\u201d \n\nOverall, the studies point to a possible modulation of amygdala's BOLD signal during one single Session of NF-training. There is replicated evidence of selective targeted up-regulation of the left amygdala during the recall of happy autobiographic memories in depressed (Young et al.,  ,  ; Zotev et al.,  ) and healthy individuals (Zotev et al.,  ,  ), during cognitive reappraisal (Sarkheil et al.,  ) and reality check (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ) in healthy controls, and in PTSD (Nicholson et al.,  ; Zotev et al.,  ). The answer to this question seems therefore to be positive, at least from the best-controlled (clinical trial) studies. Despite that, there is substantial variability between studies, study characteristics and design, protocol structure and, in particular, the outcome measures to assess BOLD signal changes in amygdala activity, which precludes identifying the optimal protocol features for rtfMRI-NF applied to Emotion regulation training. These findings suggest that there are still important limitations in the design of a clear conceptual framework of NF-training research. \n\nQuestion (1.1) What are the outcome measures used among studies? \n\nThe definition of outcome measures is one of the most debated topics in the field of NF. How can we measure the success of a NF training? Should we focus on clinical outcomes or brain signal changes? How do we study the explanatory power of the protocol features? Currently, there is still no consensual solution for this problem. \n\nThe analysis of magnitude of effect sizes (i.e., meta-analysis) is suitable to test the efficacy of a treatment/experimental procedure when the results extracted from multiple experiments share a similar design and test one (or equivalent) dependent variable. However, as in a recently published systematic review regarding NF training (e.g., Rogala et al.,  ), the designs and outcome measures used in the studies reviewed here did not meet these criteria. In fact, the various statistical outcome measures reported among studies were not comparable. Accordingly, the authors reported results using different statistical methods to analyze contrasts between distinct experimental variables and considered different moments of the training protocol. \n\nTrying to overcome some of these limitations, Rogala et al. ( ) suggested a novel and interesting strategy for the success quantification: they individually qualified the training results as a failure (0) or success (1) based on the statistical measures used by each study. Training was considered successful when at least one of the multiple statistical comparisons performed in a study was significant; then, non-parametric tests were used to estimate the correlation of each training factor with the training success scores. This is an interesting approach that allows the analysis of associations between variables and results. Nevertheless, the level of reliability of this methodology is questionable. Categorizing an intervention that presents a significant effect as successful, while not considering non-significant results in other key contrasts, most likely leads to the overestimation of the success of an intervention\u2014and this may contribute to a bias in the results. These non-specific factors (variables associated to non-significant results) are often undervalued in NF-training designs, with statistical data sometimes being omitted. This is unfortunate as it complicates the interpretation of the results. \n\nConcerning the reviewed studies, if we isolate the 12 studies that show significant results in the reported outcome measures and which were considered for this analysis, we conclude that none of these measured all of the important dimensions: comparison between Experimental and Control Groups, comparison between Training NF Runs and comparison between Last Run and Transfer Run. In fact, four of the selected studies showed significant results in two of the reported measurements but they did not have a Control Group; five showed only significant results (both regarding Transfer Run and the comparison between groups) but did not report data contrasting different moments of the Training (NF Runs); three studies found significant results in all the reported statistical measurements, but did not perform a contrast between the Last and an additional Transfer Run. \n\nThis great variability in the statistical outputs implies that it is currently not possible to objectively meta-analyze the effectiveness of the NF technique in amygdala modulation when comparing such different statistical outcome measures. Nevertheless, an extensive description and critical appraisal of the results is presented in the next sections. \n\nQuestions (1.2) \u201cAre there sustained brain changes in the amygdala as a result from neuromodulation by rtfMRI-NF training across runs (within Session)?\u201d \n\nIn most studies, results of the contrast between different moments of a Single Training Session were presented. Some of them reported the differences between the Regulate Condition and the Control Condition in the Last Run whereas others presented the contrasts of the same variables considering the Transfer Run. \n\nCrucially, the majority of studies did not present the contrast between Regulate and Control Condition, a central contrast to ensure that the effect observed in amygdala activity was due to the induced experimental manipulation, and not to a general task involvement. This led to the conclusion that, despite evidence of amygdala activity modulation given by the significant results reported by the studies, there was clear variability and contradictory findings within and between studies, as well as missing crucial information. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of modulation within the same Session. \n\nIt is important to discuss the different results that were found between different clinical and non-clinical populations. The study describing results of rtfMRI-NF training in participants with Borderline Personality Disorder showed no significant results on amygdala modulation in any of the indicated measures, although the same authors had previously found significant effects in healthy participants during the Transfer Run (Paret et al.,  ). This suggests that clinical conditions affect the efficacy of rtfMRI-NF training, raising additional questions on the neural underpinnings of the effectiveness of this technique. On the other hand, one of the studies focused on Major Depressive Disorder and showed a significant effect of condition in the Transfer Run but no effect of condition in the Last Run (Zotev et al.,  ). This is an unexpected result, since the ability to neuromodulate the amygdala during a Transfer Run is expected to reflect improvements achieved during NF training. \n\nQuestion (1.3) \u201cAre there sustained brain changes as a result of fMRI-NF neuromodulation training across different sessions?\u201d \n\nOnly six studies (31.58%) included more than one Training Session in the research protocol. Of these, only two reported an effect of Session. Therefore, again, there were not enough data to respond to the reliability of using modulation across Sessions to prove the efficacy of NF training. Moreover, one should also consider the effects of direct NF from those of the mental training between Sessions (Subramanian et al.,  ). Non-voluntary carry-over effects within- and across-Session should not be considered just as confounds but should instead also reflect positive non-voluntary learning effects of NF training (e.g., Rieger et al.,  ). \n\nQuestion (1.4) Were the brain changes only visible in the Experimental Group (compared to the Control Group)? \n\nThe inclusion of a Control Group is a critical point to discuss as it allows the distinction between observed effects due to NF training manipulation (only visible in the Experimental Group) and observed effects more likely explained by other confound non-controlled variables (in case there are no Experimental vs. Control Group differences) (Ali\u00f1o et al.,  ). Accordingly, the manipulation effect should occur only in the Experimental, not in the Control Group. However, in the reviewed articles, not all of the studies that included a Control Group reported between-group comparative results, nor even the outcomes of contrasts within the Control Group. This introduces a relevant report bias. \n\nQuestion (1.5) Is the amygdala response lateralized? \n\nOverall, it was possible to detect a tendency for the Up-Regulation protocols to result predominantly in left amygdala modulation, whereas Down-Regulation protocols more effectively modulated the right amygdala. This tendency was reported in previous studies which showed more right-lateralized activity associated with the Down-Regulation of emotions (Paret et al.,  ; Morawetz et al.,  ). Accordingly, the literature points out that the right amygdala is mainly involved in the automatic processing of emotions and left amygdala in the cognitively controlled emotional processing (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Dyck et al.,  ). Published evidence supports the explicit processing lateralization of the amygdala (e.g., Zotev et al.,  ). \n\nQuestion (2.1) Which stimuli were used to induce emotional states and how effective were they? \n\nIn almost half of the studies, the authors chose not to use any kind of stimuli for emotion induction. In these cases, the ER strategy applied was either autobiographic memory recall or a free and subjective strategy. In those that employed emotional stimuli, visual material from international picture systems was mainly used (e.g., negative emotional faces of anger and fear used to up-regulate amygdala activation). \n\nStatistical significance of effects was present or absent irrespective of the use of stimuli for emotional induction. Therefore, the relationship between training efficacy and presence/type of stimulus presented is unclear. Morawetz et al. ( ) suggested that the outcome of ER appears to be unaffected by stimulus material. However, the interaction of stimulus presentation with induction strategy has to be taken into account when considering the role of stimuli as supporting modulators of amygdala activity: changing the interface from visual to other modality might affect neuromodulation across subjects, but more studies on this are required. Full examination of this question would require a within subject design. \n\nImportantly, the amygdala is known to rapidly adapt its response to stimuli, in particular emotional stimuli (Breiter et al.,  ). Habituation to stimulus effects may diminish the ER and training effects in the studies with a repeated-stimulus design (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ). Therefore, one should consider this effect in an experimental design and/or in data analysis (e.g., Blackford et al.,  ). Designing shorter blocks (Blackford et al.,  ), and ensuring that each stimulus presented in each Session is not seen previously may primarily counteract possible habituation effects (Br\u00fchl et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ). Moreover, one should also consider the implications of traditional \u201cboxcar\u201d paradigms for modeling amygdala activation (Blackford et al.,  ; Sladky et al.,  ; Plichta et al.,  ), as neurofeedback approaches usually employ this type of design. Block duration can be optimized by tuning according to the temporal time course of habituation as determined experimentally, or by modeling amygdala response parameter estimates per subject for each stimulation block separately (Sladky et al.,  ; Plichta et al.,  ). Another amygdala habituation prevention strategy associated with successful NF interventions is the inclusion of a Count Condition interspersed with the ER Condition (Zotev et al.,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ,  ; Yuan et al.,  ). This non-emotional task is cognitively engaging, allowing for amygdala disengagement after NF up-regulation and before the following NF up-regulation block. \n\nQuestion (2.2) Which Emotion Regulation strategies were the participants instructed to use and how effective were they? \n\nFrom the 10 studies that instructed their participants to apply a free ER strategy, four studies reported no significant results. \n\nWithin the studies that defined a strategy   a priori  , in those that used cognitive ER strategies, distinct effects were found: studies that used Cognitive Reappraisal as ER strategy reported no significant effects in amygdala modulation, whereas when Reality Checking was used, significant effects arose. Finally, the majority of studies that used Recall of Autobiographical Memories as the ER strategy reported significant effects. There is indeed evidence of effective modulation of amygdala activity using positive autobiographical memories, both in healthy subjects as in Major Depressive Disorder (Young et al.,  ). \n\nDespite the apparent efficacy of ER cognitive strategies like Cognitive Reappraisal and Reality Checking, only two studies instructed and trained participants to apply them, one each. Given that nearly half of the studies with no predefined ER strategy showed significant results, this points to an important issue that requires definition, as the use of implicit or explicit mental imagery strategies for self-regulation is a current topic of debate in the literature. While explicit strategies direct the individual for a specific mean of self-regulation, implicit approaches provide no information and, therefore, allow participants to explore different strategies (Sulzer et al.,  ). However, it seems that implicit approaches increase variability in the studies, hindering the inference of causal relationships. In fact, the present data corroborates this assumption: studies in which the participants were instructed with a defined ER strategy, especially when they had the chance to previously practice this strategy, point to a more reliable positive effect than studies with a subjective and free regulation strategy. \n\nQuestion (2.3) How do fMRI acquisition parameters and analysis plans relate to the identification of training effects? \n\nThe collected evidence suggests a trend for successful results in the presence of the following features: (a) low slice thickness, (b) TR not < 2,000 ms, and (c) the use of denoising methods such as drift and artifact removal and head motion correction during data preprocessing (all studies did motion correction either online and offline). Results for slice thickness conform to previous studies that have reported robust bilateral amygdala activation for slice thickness of 2 mm instead of 4 mm (Bellgowan et al.,  ; Morawetz et al.,  ), and also with better SNR at 3 T for slice thickness of 2\u20132.5 mm (Robinson et al.,  ) or 3 mm (Merboldt et al.,  ), compared to 4\u20136 mm thick slices (Robinson et al.,  ). Moreover, successful modulation was obtained in most of the studies that used TR = 2 s, which has to be considered in light of previous reports of physiological confounds in BOLD changes with TRs of this magnitude (see Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,   for a review). These results suggest that the use of shorter TRs, which at the same time imply less brain coverage (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ) and introduce other type of noise (Zhao et al.,  ), may not be necessary and that other parameters may be more critical. \n\nIt is important to consider that acquisition sequences and particular parameters all involve tradeoffs, which need to be considered when evaluating ultimate signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and BOLD sensitivity. This can be achieved for instance with the use of a highly sensitive MR signal detector such as an RF arrayed head coil (Fujita,  ), the concomitant measurement of physiological signals for signal denoising, and of acceleration techniques to achieve the best tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and respective SNRs (for a thorough revision of fMRI parameter recommendations for amygdala measurements please see Guidelines section below). \n\nThe use of a functional localizer is an alternative to the anatomy-based approach (coordinates combined with geometrical ROIs, atlas-defined regions, manual tracing or automatic parcellation) (Sulzer et al.,  ) and has both advantages and disadvantages. Anatomical definitions are usually preferred for well-defined brain regions (e.g., amygdala, basal ganglia structures), to minimize interindividual variance. The use of a functional localizer may allow for better functional contrast guided approaches and reduced partial volume effects, due to non-significant activations that may occur within anatomically defined ROIs (Weiskopf et al.,  ). In this review, when defining the amygdala as the target for NF, few studies (only two) used a functional localizer to define the target ROI. In most cases, specific ROIs were anatomically defined based on atlases' coordinates previously reported in task-related studies or on macroscopic anatomical landmarks. One may point out that functional selection of task-specific voxels in the amygdala region may end up targeting different amygdala nuclei, each one with specific connections and functions (Roy et al.,  ; Salzman and Fusi,  ). This individual variation in voxel selection, or the inclusion of voxels outside the amygdala, may explain inconsistent results (in our review, 50% of the studies employing localizers lacked significant results). Nevertheless, a combination of the two approaches may be helpful. For instance, some of the studies targeting the amygdala used a \u201cbest voxel selection\u201d tool implemented in Turbo-Brain Voyager (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands) to select task-related voxels within predefined anatomical masks (e.g., Paret et al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ). This tool ensured that the same number of voxels were used for signal extraction across subjects, while still restricting it to the anatomically expected location (Nicholson et al.,  ). \n\nNew techniques also arose to potentially overcome some of these limitations. Therefore, when analyzing the evidence for ER NF, it is important to differentiate traditional activation studies and studies employing new techniques such as multivariate analysis (e.g., MVPA) and connectivity analysis (e.g., effective connectivity using DCM). The later allows for strengthening of functional connections between regions, respectively (Thibault et al.,  ). However, approaches using MVPA classification results (decoding positive or negative emotions) or connection strength (in DCM) for feedback are still at their infancy. In fact, most of the studies in this systematic review focused on modifying brain activity within a targeted ROI, the amygdala. But the use of connectivity-based NF may introduce new ways to explore NF training in ER as the amygdala belongs to a network of regions contributing to ER (Thibault et al.,  ) and these techniques allow modifying the connectivity of a targeted network (Watanabe et al.,  ; Thibault et al.,  ). Unfortunately, connectivity measures are still mostly used as   post-hoc   readouts and not as NF signals. In the same manner, multivariate analysis may facilitate online classification for use in NF. Instead of relying on GLM NF, which is based on time series fluctuations and averaged amplitude of fMRI voxels in localized brain regions, it can take advantage of information from distributed voxel patterns (LaConte et al.,  ; LaConte,  ; Sulzer et al.,  ; Watanabe et al.,  ). Data driven methods such as multivariate analyses based on machine learning can identify distributed activity patterns and may be particularly useful when individual variations in NF strategies are used (LaConte,  ). Moreover, multivariate methods and ROI-based methods can be used in a complementary manner (LaConte,  ; Sulzer et al.,  ). It was therefore surprising that in this systematic review employing these new methods over the traditional GLM-based approach did not present significant effects concerning successful rtNF training (Koush et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). \n\nQuestion (2.4) Is there any potential bias created by the NF protocols? \n\nFor an overall judgement of the general internal validity of the results of the reviewed literature, key methodological limitations and an analysis of the (in)consistencies of those results were addressed. Biases can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effects. To investigate the risk of bias, the following categories were analyzed: selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and reporting bias (Higgins and Green,  ). \n\nSince 14 of the 19 studies did not completely describe the participants' selection process, there is risk of selection bias. Additionally, one study did not refer the gender of the participants, one study recruited only female participants and one study recruited only male participants, which prevents generalization to the whole population, although reduces the variability due to gender issues. Additionally, not all the studies reported blinded or masked processes of participants' assignment into groups. From the 11 studies that included a Control Group, only six referred a random and blinded allocation of participants into their group. This established a risk of bias within the seven studies that may not have performed an adequate and concealed allocation process. \n\nRegarding the completeness of data related to study information, there were no reported participant dropouts, with five studies reporting justified participants' exclusion (varying from one to four participants). The reasons for exclusion were: technical errors, large head motion, incomplete data for statistical analysis and participants falling asleep during the task. Regarding completeness of data from statistical outcome measures (in which concerns amygdala modulation), from the 10 studies that included a Control Group, three studies did not report comparative statistical results within the Control Group or the Experimental Group or results of statistical analyses contrasting Groups. Additionally, 11 studies included a Transfer Run, but only six reported the statistics of the contrasts for this moment of the protocol and only six studies reported statistical data regarding the contrast between the Last NF Run and the Transfer Run. These omissions of statistical outcomes seem to point to potential biases across the reviewed studies, which may be considered as a risk for selective reporting bias irrespective of their overall merit. \n\n### Guidelines for Future Neurofeedback Training Protocols for Emotion Regulation \n  \nThe current discussion led us to propose a few rules-of-thumb to help develop approaches, preventing nuisance effects from uncontrolled non-specific factors. \n\nFirst, it seems important to ensure the specificity of the effects found during NF training. Are the significant amygdala responses reported causally related to the NF-training or, instead, can these be better explained by other variables? An accurate definition of the ROI is essential here. A combination of anatomical and functional approaches should be preferred to ensure ROI correct definition across subjects but also task-specific voxel selection. \n\nAlthough difficult to select, given the matching required, the definition of a control ROI should also be considered to ensure that the effects are specific for the target ROI (Sorger et al.,  ). \n\nMoreover, when functionally defined, the localizer run used the same stimuli of the NF runs, which may pose a problem of stimuli habituation. NF designs targeting brain regions prone to habituation, e.g., amygdala, should specifically address habituation through experimental designs and modeling parameters to minimize these effects. \n\nAnother relevant factor for the interpretation of the causality of the effects found is the inclusion of a Practice Run and a Transfer Run in the protocols. Previous reports discussing the current frame on NF studies postulate that offline mental training between Sessions could be advantageous toward accelerating learning (Sulzer et al.,  ). Pre-post data (from Practice Run and Transfer Runs) could advance the understanding of whether and to what extent amygdala NF training can change the activation of neural circuitries of ER. Moreover, it would allow reliable protocol replications in future studies. \n\nNF training protocols should also include a Control Group, to control for confounds in learning, behavioral and placebo effects (Sulzer et al.,  ). A Control Group allows for the demonstration of behavioral change that is directly related to rtfMRI feedback training and to establish causality and specificity. In fact, experimental designs that lack a no-feedback or sham feedback Control Group cannot dissociate whether the change in the target region's activity is due to the provided feedback or instead to other variables such as mental strategies, attention capacity, motivation or another external factor. Well-controlled protocol designs are needed since only when controlling for confounding variables can one tease apart the effects of a rtfMRI-NF intervention (for a thorough discussion on controls definition, see Sorger et al.,  ). Reporting consistent and comparable outcome measures would allow for a meta-analytical assessment of the NF efficacy. First, due to the substantial variability in the number of participants in a rtfMRI-NF study, effect sizes (Cohen's   d  ) should be reported in addition to   p  -values. \n\nSecond, the inclusion of linear increase in difficulty from run to run to upregulate amygdala activation via NF is recommended, as it has been shown effective to promote a linear trend in the learning process across NF runs in the Experimental Group (Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ). Finally, to understand how the amygdala responds to NF training, it would be helpful to structure the statistical analysis plan by levels of outcome measures of amygdala modulation: (1) control of brain activity with neurofeedback, and (2) control of brain activity without neurofeedback (Transfer Run). Results for amygdala modulation should therefore report effect sizes of the following contrasts: (1) Regulate vs. Control Condition (effect size of amygdala activity levels averaged across all NF runs, both for Experimental and Control groups), (2) Experimental vs. Control Group (for the Regulate Condition, and in two different moments of the Training protocol: Practice Run and Transfer Run), (3) Practice Run vs. Transfer Run (within both groups). Not performing or not reporting these contrasts or at least one of these, defined   a priori   based on a specific hypothesis, may constitute a strong handicap and places the study in a position of potential bias. \n\nIn the future, we hope to be able to isolate studies using a commonly structured protocol (including Practice Run and Transfer Runs) in order to perform group level quantitative systematic review of ER NF studies. Nevertheless, such meta-analytic approach also presents a few limitations with the additional risk of isolating one protocol structure that may not be the most effective for particular applications. \n\nConsidering methodologic aspects of fMRI, the study protocol should also define sequence parameters such as pixel size (in-plane resolution), slice thickness, TE and slice orientation adjusted to the target region. The use of TR in the order of 2 s seems to be a good compromise. In general, signal loss increases with TE (Posse et al.,  , ), slice thickness, and voxel size (Olman et al.,  ; Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ). Particularly for the amygdala region, previous studies have reported results of BOLD sensitivity simulations showing better results for slice thickness equal of inferior to 3 mm (Merboldt et al.,  ; Robinson et al.,  ; Bellgowan et al.,  ; Morawetz et al.,  ). However, the choice of slice thickness should balance reduction of volume coverage, signal dephasing and loss in SNR (Young et al.,  ; Posse et al.,  ). Both coronal (Chen et al.,  ; Robinson et al.,  ) and axial or axial-oblique (Robinson et al.,  ) section orientations were found to be optimal for amygdala acquisition, although axial orientation may be preferred as it allows for a larger brain coverage per slice (Robinson et al.,  ). Moreover, in regions particularly prone to distortion such as the amygdala, fast image acquisition methods such as SENSE and GRAPPA (Blaimer et al.,  ; Bhavsar et al.,  ) can be used to reduce geometric distortion and signal dropout (Olman et al.,  ; Bhavsar et al.,  ) although some noise enhancement has been reported (Marxen et al.,  ). The combination of parallel imaging with multi-echo EPI might compensate for this loss (Bhavsar et al.,  ), increasing BOLD signal changes in subcortical brain structures such as the amygdala. Although the concomitant use of the two methods may reduce imaging artifacts and preserve BOLD sensitivity (Bhavsar et al.,  ), one should also consider that the use of multi-echo brings limitations such as loss of spatial resolution, as smaller matrix sizes are required to increase the number of TEs that can be collected (Posse et al.,  ). Good results have been achieved with single echo times combined with parallel imaging for the amygdala region (Kirilina et al.,  ) and successfully applied in rtfMRI-NF studies (e.g., Zotev et al.,  ). To more effectively parcel out physiological noise effects, the concomitant acquisition of heart and respiratory measures during the experiment is advised (e.g., Zotev et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ; Koush et al.,  ; Marxen et al.,  ), allowing cardiorespiratory artifact correction and therefore improving   post-hoc   processing and data analysis (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ). Although requiring computationally intensive fMRI processing, real-time correction of physiological noise is also possible to perform (see real-time method developed by Misaki et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, attention should be given to prevent regional geometric distortions, decreasing the variability in the coordinates for each region. Nowadays, brain imaging software packages provide tools for distortion correction, either through acquisition of additional phase and magnitude EPI scans to map the spatial distribution of field inhomogeneities (e.g., Hutton et al.,  ) or through acquisition of an additional single-volume EPI scan with reverse phase encoding polarity to estimate a voxel displacement map (e.g., Pedersen et al.,  ). Nevertheless, this needs to be considered during data acquisition. \n\nIn sum, a rtfMRI-NF protocol and parameter selection should be defined to allow for critical comparisons that can effectively measure NF training effects. More studies are needed with a multi-visit design to proof efficacy in larger populations including patients on medication, and one should carefully weigh the pros and cons of each methodological fMRI parameter considering the region being studied before designing a rtfMRI-NF. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Work \n  \nThe main limitation of this study was the sample size, as we had only 19 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria for this review. One can say that if a less keyword selective search formula was applied we would also loose data quality and specificity in the review. \n\nAnother point worth questioning was the choice of a brain structure to modulate\u2014the amygdala\u2014given that other brain structures are also involved in ER. In fact, several of the present studies presented results regarding other brain regions, such as the insula (Johnston et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Nicholson et al.,  ), the anterior cingulate cortex (Johnston et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ) and the prefrontal cortex (Koush et al.,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ; Paret et al.,  ). However, the decision to center this review on the amygdala was taken given the central role of this structure in the ER network. \n\nFor future work, if one wants to use effective ER training to address pathological processes in clinical populations, it might be relevant to understand how other brain structures respond to ER training using NF, the dependence of NF on ER methodology and tasks employed, and the specificities of the populations being studied. A recent systematic review (Zilverstand et al.,  ) highlighted brain activity differences between clinical and healthy cohorts suggesting that in clinical populations different subdomains of ER may be affected, involving different brain structures. Accordingly, hyperactivation of the amygdala seems to occur in mood disorders. Instead, hypoactivation of dACC/parietal cortex occurs in anxiety related disorders. This review (Zilverstand et al.,  ) also provides some evidence that ER deficits may not only be disorder-specific but also task dependent. It is therefore important to conduct future studies comparing the efficacy of NF training in the amygdala in mood and anxiety disorders as well as in healthy cohorts. Regardless, the choice of the brain region to modulate through NF in the clinical population should be driven by clinical neuroscience approaches. In other words, the NF target region should be defined according to the characteristic cognitive impairments of the clinical condition. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nSeveral reports in the literature on ER training through rtfMRI-based NF focus on the potential relevance of the amygdala in this process. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on the efficacy of rtfMRI-NF for ER using modulation of BOLD signal in the amygdala as an outcome measure of interest. However, despite the identification of positive results, it turns out that this outcome measure was heterogeneously defined across studies and arises from various and different condition contrasts. Classification of the success of NF ER modulation (potential success measures) was also often based on distinct criteria. Nevertheless, some of the positive results conformed to the high standards of clinical trials. \n\nIt is vital to find common criteria and comparable quantitative outcome measures of NF training. We identified a large variability of contrasts employed across studies to measure the effects of amygdala modulation. Standardization of effect size measures would enable meta-analysis based on the critical protocol features. An unbiased understanding of modulation mechanisms is possible, thus, allowing study designs that can determine the generalization of effects. \n\nIn conclusion, this work provides qualitative evidence for amygdala modulation during neurofeedback, but also highlights the large heterogeneity across NF studies for ER training, both of which concern experimental design and choice of measures to define the efficiency of an intervention, as well as statistical analysis plans and definition of primary and secondary outcome measures. We suggest some guidelines to reduce the heterogeneity and bias of protocols so that effect sizes can be generalized to the population in future work. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nARB designed the work, performed data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and wrote the article.

Despite the accumulation of neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, a clear and comprehensive picture of the disorder\u2019s neural correlates has yet to emerge. The current study is a meta-analysis of functional MRI studies of psychopathy. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify consistent findings across 25 studies (460 foci) of task-related brain activity. Psychopathy was associated with increased task-related activity predominantly in midline cortical regions overlapping with the default mode network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and precuneus) as well as medial temporal lobe (including amygdala). Psychopathy was related to decreased task-related activity in a region of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex overlapping with the salience network. These findings challenge predominant theories of amygdala hypoactivity and highlight the potential role of hyperactivity in medial default mode network regions and hypoactivity in a key node of the salience network during task performance in psychopathy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTwo decades of neuroimaging studies have begun to specify the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy, a personality disorder characterized by callous and impulsive antisocial behavior. Present in approximately one-quarter of adult male prison inmates , psychopathy is a significant predictor of violent reoffending  that costs the United States an estimated $460 billion per year , making psychopathy one of the most costly mental health disorders. Despite the accumulation of neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, a clear and comprehensive picture of the disorder\u2019s neural correlates has yet to emerge. \n\nSpecifying the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy could have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, as well as for the criminal justice system. Clinically, the identification of neural correlates of psychopathy could inform the development of biomarkers for vulnerability and early detection, anatomical targets for intervention, and predictors of treatment response. Furthermore, given the relatively high prevalence of psychopathy among criminal offenders and its predictive utility for violent reoffending, there is growing interest in the relevance of neuroimaging data for predicting future offense , as well as for influencing sentencing of psychopathic offenders . Hence, neuroimaging research on psychopathy has multiple potential applications. \n\nNeuroimaging studies to date have generally tested specific theoretical models of neurobiological dysfunction in psychopathy. In fact, we identified 68 neuroimaging studies of psychopathy that used hypothesis-driven, region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, compared with 50 studies that used whole-brain analyses. The amygdala, in particular, is the focus of a robust literature on impaired fear and threat processing in psychopathy . Psychopathic individuals show diminished amygdala activity during aversive conditioning , facial emotion recognition , and moral judgment . Amygdala volume reductions  and surface deformations  have also been observed in psychopathic individuals. A region densely interconnected with the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), has also received substantial attention in the psychopathy literature . Psychopathic individuals show reduced vmPFC activity during moral judgment  and reduced vmPFC volume . Amygdala and vmPFC have been identified by one theoretical perspective as the primary circuit of dysfunction in psychopathy . According to this perspective, deficits in these regions underlie psychopathic individuals\u2019 failure to pair negative and positive outcomes with their own actions. \n\nAnother perspective expands the scope of neural dysfunction beyond amygdala and vmPFC to the paralimbic cortex more broadly, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal pole, insula, and parahippocampal gyrus . Indeed, psychopathy has been associated with structural  and functional  abnormalities in these regions. Moreover, deficits similar to those of psychopathic individuals have been observed in patients with lesions in paralimbic regions, including vmPFC , ACC , and amygdala . \n\nPsychopathic individuals also display heightened sensitivity to rewards and sensation-seeking behavior , which has been linked to increased volume and activity in the striatum . Psychopathic individuals show enlargements in several subregions of the striatum, including caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens , and increased activity of nucleus accumbens during reward anticipation . Increased volume and activity in the striatum may thus contribute to psychopathic individuals\u2019 impulsive, sensation-seeking behavior. Although the studies outlined above highlight the importance of striatum and paralimbic regions\u2014particularly amygdala and vmPFC\u2014in psychopathy, reliance on primarily hypothesis-driven analyses may limit the identification of other relevant brain circuits. \n\nA recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies aimed to specify the neural correlates of psychopathy using a whole-brain approach . Psychopathy was negatively related to task-based activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and right amygdala, and positively related to activity in bilateral anterior insula. However, methodological characteristics of this recent meta-analysis limit the interpretations that can be drawn from these findings. First, the prior study included the effects of the distinct subsets of psychopathic traits in their meta-analysis of total psychopathy. Conflating subsets of psychopathic traits with the disorder itself could lead to the interpretation that a particular brain region or network is related to psychopathy overall, when in fact it is related to a restricted subset of traits. In addition, their meta-analytic method, activation likelihood estimate (ALE), uses coordinates of individual activation peaks as the unit of analysis, thereby potentially allowing a small number of studies reporting relatively high numbers of activation coordinates to drive the meta-analytic results . By contrast, the current state-of-the-art meta-analytic approach, multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA), uses the contrast map from an individual study as the unit of analysis and weighs study quality and sample size, allowing for greater generalization of findings . \n\nThus, the purpose of the current study is to use MKDA to identify consistent relationships between psychopathy and neural activity across a variety of tasks. Based on the previous findings reviewed above, psychopathy was predicted to be related to decreased activity in amygdala, vmPFC, ACC, PCC, and insula, and to increased activity in the striatum. The current study originally had three additional goals: (1) to identify structural neural correlates of psychopathy, (2) to identify neural correlates of two well-established subsets of psychopathic traits, and (3) to determine whether dysfunctional neural activity in psychopathy varies by task. However, an insufficient number of studies contributed to each of the models addressing these three goals. We present preliminary results from these models in the Supplementary Materials (Tables  \u2013 ), and focus our discussion on the functional neural correlates of psychopathy across tasks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and coding \n  \nWe conducted a forward literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, and a backward literature search in the reference sections of relevant papers. The following search terms were used in the forward literature search: psychopathy, psychopathic, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and neuroimaging. Studies published prior to December 31, 2019 were included based on the following criteria: (1) reported peak coordinates in Talairach  or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space, (2) used whole-brain analyses, (3) sampled only participants aged 18 and older, (4) reported group statistics rather than single-case results, and (5) compared brain activity with a measure of psychopathy. The results from group comparisons (e.g., psychopaths vs. controls) and continuous analyses (i.e., variability across a range of psychopathy scores) were included. The resulting dataset included 460 foci from 87 contrasts in 25 studies of task-based functional activity (Table  ). Figure   displays the number of studies excluded at each stage of the literature search.   \nSummary of studies included in the functional meta-analysis for total psychopathy. \n  \n PCL-R   psychopathy checklist-revised ;   PPI-R   psychopathic personality inventory-revised ;   PSPS   primary and secondary psychopathy scales ;   SRP-SF   self-report psychopathy short form . \n     Flowchart of the literature search process.  \nAfter a full-text review, studies were excluded for using region of interest (ROI) rather than whole-brain analyses (68 studies), examining neural measures other than task-based neural activity (21 studies), summarizing prior literature rather than reporting new findings (18 studies), not reporting peak coordinates of findings related to total psychopathy (15 studies), grouping impulsive, non-psychopathic participants with psychopathic participants (1 study), excluding non-psychopathic participants from a continuous analysis of psychopathy (1 study), and reporting single-case results (1 study). \n  \n\nWe ensured that included contrasts were coded such that \u201cpositive\u201d activation indicated greater activity associated with the cognitive function of interest in each study. For example, contrasts from studies examining facial emotion processing were coded as fear faces\u2009>\u2009neutral faces , and contrasts from studies examining moral judgment were coded as moral\u2009>\u2009non-moral . Each reported coordinate was coded as relating positively or negatively to total psychopathy. Accuracy of the foci and corresponding information was verified by a second coder. \n\nWe determined that models with at least 15 included studies would achieve sufficient power in MKDA. Although no published standards exist for the number of included studies required for MKDA, there is evidence that 17\u201320 experiments are sufficient for another meta-analytic approach (ALE) . Given the statistical advantages of MKDA, we used a threshold of 15 studies. See Tables  \u2013  for preliminary results from models that did not meet this threshold. \n\n\n### Multilevel kernel density analysis \n  \nAnalyses were conducted using the MKDA toolbox in SPM12 . Foci in Talairach space were converted to MNI space . Binary indicator maps for each contrast were created by convolving peak foci using a 10-mm spherical kernel, with voxels related to psychopathy assigned a value of 1. Next, each indicator map was weighted by the square root of the study\u2019s sample size, and the weighted average of the indicator maps was computed. The resulting density maps represented the proportion of studies showing psychopathy relationships within 10\u2009mm. Finally, statistical thresholding was determined via 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results were considered significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 using height-based criteria or cluster extent-based criteria. Images for the figures were generated in AFNI (16.0) . Individual models were run for positive and negative relationships with total psychopathy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAcross all functional studies, total psychopathy was negatively related to neural activity in dorsal ACC (Fig.   and Table  ). In contrast, total psychopathy was positively related to neural activity in a large, bilateral portion of medial parietal and occipital cortex (including PCC and precuneus), bilateral dmPFC, right inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior orbitofrontal cortex, right medial temporal cortex (including amygdala), right hippocampus, and right parahippocampal gyrus (Fig.   and Table  ).    Consistent relationships between total psychopathy scores and brain function during experimental tasks.  \nMedial views depict the location of the coronal slice. \n    \nSignificant associations between brain function and psychopathy. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThrough a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, we identified several reliable neural correlates of psychopathy. We discuss three main conclusions from these results. For two of the main conclusions, we draw on a body of literature that has identified three intrinsic, large-scale networks that serve core cognitive functions : the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). Whereas DMN increases activity during self-referential processing and decreases activity during externally focused, non-self-referential tasks , FPN increases activity during cognitively demanding, externally focused tasks . There is evidence that SN, which is particularly important for detecting salient external stimuli, is responsible for switching between the two anticorrelated networks, DMN and FPN . Our findings suggest that psychopathy is related to dysfunction within DMN and SN across a variety of tasks. \n\nFirst, we note the considerable overlap between the areas of psychopathy-related positive activity and the DMN, particularly in dmPFC and PCC/precuneus (Fig.  ). One interpretation, previously outlined by Freeman et al. , is that psychopathic individuals fail to deactivate these midline DMN regions during externally focused tasks. Such a failure could result in increased competition between DMN and externally oriented attention networks (such as FPN), disrupt the shift of attention to the external task, and lead to corresponding performance deficits . However, because the current meta-analytic evidence does not directly corroborate this interpretation, future studies are warranted to clarify whether overactivity within midline DMN regions in psychopathy reflects less task-associated deactivation or greater task-associated activation. Findings of reduced deactivation in DMN regions may align with theories that highlight attention deficits in psychopathy , although future studies could investigate whether dysfunction in networks involved in allocating attention to cognitively demanding tasks, such as FPN or SN, is more closely associated with psychopathic individuals\u2019 attention deficits. In psychopathy, PCC/precuneus is not only overactive across a variety of tasks, but also less functionally and structurally connected to other DMN regions, including dmPFC  and vmPFC , and to a region of FPN .    Large-scale networks and regions associated with psychopathy.  \n a   Overlap between default mode network (DMN) and regions of hyperactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks.   b   Overlap between salience network (SN) and regions of hypoactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks. A functional connectivity-based atlas was used to display canonical DMN and SN regions . \n  \n\nSecond, as predicted, psychopathy was related to reduced dorsal ACC activity across a variety of tasks. Research in healthy humans and animal populations has implicated the dorsal ACC in a number of processes, including experiencing negative affect and pain, cognitive control , and linking task context to strategy . As a key SN node (Fig.  ), the dorsal ACC, along with insula, is neuroanatomically situated to send rapid signals deactivating DMN and activating FPN . Indeed, there is evidence that SN functions at the top of a hierarchy that includes DMN and FPN, modulating the two anticorrelated networks via inhibitory connections to DMN and excitatory connections to FPN . Thus, one interpretation of reduced dorsal ACC activity in psychopathy, in combination with increased DMN activity, is that this SN node fails to properly deactivate DMN, leading to competition between attentional resources while psychopathic individuals are engaged in an externally oriented task. While speculative, the hypothesis of reduced SN influence on DMN activity could be tested via methods such as Granger causality  or dynamic causal modeling . Prior analyses of resting-state functional connectivity lend initial corroborating evidence of altered dynamics between the three networks: dorsal ACC (of the SN) and precuneus (of the DMN) are less functionally connected to the right intraparietal sulcus (of the FPN) in psychopathic offenders . \n\nNotably, some researchers have argued that common dysfunction within and between these intrinsic networks (DMN, FPN, and SN) underlies a range of psychopathology . For example, a diminished modulating effect of SN on DMN and FPN has been observed in patients with schizophrenia  and elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment . However, disorders may be distinguished by unique dysfunction in specific nodes of these core networks (e.g., hyperactive subgenual ACC in depression) . Further inquiry is necessary to establish whether hyperactivity in medial DMN nodes and underactivity in SN is unique to psychopathy or shared among other disorders. \n\nThird, we found overall increased levels of amygdala activity associated with psychopathy. Contrary to previous ROI-based studies, we observed no evidence of decreased amygdala activity across a variety of tasks. (Even preliminary analyses of socioemotional processing, e.g., facial emotion processing in Table  , failed to yield evidence of decreased amygdala activity.) This finding challenges predominant views in the field, which identify amygdala hypoactivity as a key neural deficit in psychopathy . Further research is thus necessary to more thoroughly characterize amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy, and the following considerations may guide those studies. First, the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure, with distinct subnuclei that subserve different functions and interact with different brain networks . Psychopathy may be linked to hyperactivity in specific amygdala subnuclei and hypoactivity in others, a possibility that has already been raised by one theoretical perspective . Indeed, several studies have found that amygdala relationships with psychopathy vary by subnucleus . Second, an emerging view proposes that, in healthy individuals, the amygdala may switch its affective mode (i.e., positive or negative, appetitive or avoidant) across situations . This raises the possibility that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy varies by context. At a minimum, the present results suggest that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy is more complex than simply reduced activation resulting in diminished fear conditioning. Future studies should examine whether altered modules (i.e., amygdala subnuclei) or modes account for this complexity. \n\nNo findings from the previous neuroimaging meta-analysis of psychopathy were replicated by the current meta-analysis . Prior findings of consistent hyperactivation in the fronto-insular cortex and hypoactivation in bilateral dlPFC, dmPFC, and right amygdala were not corroborated by our models. In fact, two findings diametrically oppose those of the previous meta-analysis: dmPFC and right amygdala were hyperactive in the current meta-analysis, but hypoactive in the previous study. Though unexpected, the differences in results could be at least partly attributed to methodological differences (i.e., study inclusion criteria, contrast selections, and meta-analytic methods), as detailed in the introduction of this paper. \n\nA primary limitation of the present meta-analysis is the exclusion of studies that employed ROI analyses, necessitated by MKDA\u2019s assumption that all included studies explored the same space (in this case, the whole brain). As a result, the present meta-analytic results do not represent the whole of the neuroimaging literature on psychopathy. This limitation could be overcome through the use of image-based meta-analysis, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods . Image-based meta-analysis requires the compilation of full statistical maps from each study to assess the overall effect sizes at each voxel. Although this method would present significant challenges, its results would offer a more complete picture of the underlying neurobiology of psychopathy. Further, the meta-analysis did not control for potential sample overlap between studies, nor did it consider separately the results from categorical or continuous analyses. While this meta-analysis included studies of community samples, which may feature relatively low levels of psychopathy, the results were largely unchanged when excluding these studies (Table  ). Last, the present results offer insights into aberrant neural activity, but no evidence regarding connectivity within networks, or how information is represented within specific brain regions in psychopathy. Previous studies have investigated the former , and machine-learning studies could address the latter. \n\nIn sum, these results associate psychopathy with neural abnormalities concentrated primarily in medial prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Crucially, no single current neurobiological theory of psychopathy accounts for the observed functional abnormalities, which include multiple cortical and subcortical regions. Consistent amygdala hyperactivity, observed here, challenges predominant views in the field that amygdala hypoactivity underlies psychopathy. A more complex characterization of amygdala function in psychopathy is necessary to account for previously observed hypoactivity and currently observed hyperactivity. Moreover, the present results highlight two intrinsic networks in which task-based activity is altered in psychopathy. Characterizing the dynamic interactions of these networks in future studies could potentially further illuminate a core neurobiological deficit of the disorder. The present meta-analysis thus provides novel insight into the neural correlates of psychopathy. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7203015, "text_md5": "f11b38423ef9fdd0d5546842d7483714", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 35], "journal": [36, 53], "publication_year": [55, 59], "title": [70, 142], "keywords": [156, 189], "abstract": [202, 1453], "body": [1462, 22424]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32376864, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-020-0816-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203015", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7203015"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203015\">7203015</a>", "list_title": "PMC7203015  Functional neural correlates of psychopathy: a meta-analysis of MRI data"}

Among the range of imaging methods, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unique in its applicability to studying both structure and function. Thus we additionally performed meta-analyses of MRI results to examine 1) the issue of anatomical variability and consistency for functional MRI (fMRI) findings, 2) the analogous issue of anatomical consistency for white-matter findings, and 3) the importance of accounting for the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. As we discuss, the human neuroimaging literature consists of both small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points that have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Our fMRI meta-analysis demonstrates a frontal vulnerability to mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal in prefrontal cortex compared to controls. This vulnerability is further highlighted by examining the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy, in which we show a strong anterior-to-posterior gradient (with anterior regions being more frequently reported in mTBI). Our final DTI meta-analysis examines a debated topic arising from inconsistent anisotropy findings across studies. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. Thus, this review and set of meta-analyses demonstrate several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. Based on the complexity of mTBI, however, much more work in this area is required to characterize injury mechanisms and recovery factors and to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for diagnosis. \n   Highlights  \n  \nmTBI neuroimaging literature review and meta-analyses of fMRI and DTI. \n  \nfMRI meta-analysis revealed differences between mTBI and controls in 13 regions. \n  \nmTBI anisotropy findings are statistically more frequently reported in anterior regions. \n  \nAnisotropy is elevated in acute mTBI, but depressed in chronic mTBI. \n  \nWe hypothesize a statistical interaction between anisotropy, cognitive score, and time. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTwo important points about today's neuroimaging clinical standard of care of mTBI may be surprising. First, even though MRI is a premier modality for imaging the brain, when used in conventional clinical modes (e.g. T2- and T1-weighted structural scans) it adds little to clinical diagnoses beyond what is provided by CT (computed tomography). Thus CTs, which are faster and more cost-effective ( ), are routinely used by the emergency department, while MRIs, which do not pose a health risk from repeated ionizing radiation exposure, are virtually never utilized for mTBIs. Second, imaging is not used to diagnose mTBI itself, but to test for hematomas as well as to rule out head injury complications from more severe trauma. Various guidelines for diagnosing mTBI exist, most of which rely on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ( ) and details of the injury (such as self and witness reported descriptions of the accident, loss of consciousness, and evaluation of sustained trauma) ( ). The GCS assesses motor, verbal and eye responses; while there is some variability in the categories, a GCS from 13 to 15 is often designated as mild TBI, 8 or below is considered severe, and 9 to 12 is considered a moderate TBI ( ). Ultimately, the diagnosis of TBI and its severity is made by a clinician. Approximately 1.4\u00a0million Americans receive TBI ( ), with most of these categorized as mTBIs ( ). \n\nAlthough mTBI has long been considered a noncritical injury, serious short and long term effects have been documented. Additionally, there is broad acceptance that multiple mTBIs can have serious long-term consequences ( ). There are two common conjectures regarding the etiology of mTBI. The first is that the frontal and anterior cortices are vulnerable to neural contusion ( ). The second is that linear and rotational forces act on axon bundles, leading to axonal injury ( ). After initial injury, secondary mechanisms elicit biochemical, metabolic, and cellular changes in the time frame of minutes, days and months ( ). Within the first fifteen minute post-injury, there is an extreme dip in neuropsychological performance ( ) and deficits can often linger for a week or longer ( ). The definition of the acute time frame varies across publications and some studies report acute periods of up to 1\u00a0month post-injury ( ). Our study uses the term acute mTBI up to two weeks post-injury. Using the term acute or \u201csemi-acute\u201d for time periods up to 2\u00a0weeks post-injury is common in the literature ( ). Most mTBI patients recover, but a substantial minority have persistent disabling problems ( ), known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Although criteria have been established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV ( ) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), PCS is difficult to diagnose and its symptoms are nonspecific. PCS also manifests symptoms similar to other disorders such as major depression ( ), chronic pain ( ) and other diseases such as somatization disorder. Indeed, neuropsychological testing in chronic stages of mTBI (even on the time scale of months) has been criticized as non-specific and insensitive ( ), and several studies have questioned the ecological validity of these assessments ( ) and proposed improved approaches for detecting persisting cognitive deficits and linking these to neuroimaging results ( ). \n\nHeterogeneity of injury and current limitations in the sensitivity of imaging are challenges to developing diagnostic tools as well as predictors of recovery. Some of the major complicating factors include: 1) the fact that mTBI is a heterogeneous injury, with complicated dependencies on the mechanism of injury (e.g. an automobile accident vs. a military blast exposure) and the directional and temporal profiles of the forces impacting the skull and body; 2) mTBI lesions are diffuse and microscopic; and 3) the expected outcome of most patients is an eventual recovery. Thus, the physical size and heterogeneous distribution of injury in the brain make detection in an individual challenging and further make reliance on group averages problematic. In addition, since the time course of the injury leads to lingering post-concussive symptoms in a small number or injuries ( ), it is a statistically challenging goal to try to predict which individuals will not recover fully. Finally, longitudinally, the presence or absence of CT findings does not correlate with long-term outcomes such as PCS ( ). To summarize, imaging is challenging at both acute and chronic stages of mTBI, and attempting to characterize the full time course compounds the level of complexity. \n\nDespite the challenges, there has been a growing research effort to characterize structural and functional effects of mTBI. As shown in this paper, the full range of neuroimaging technologies have been brought to bear on this issue, including CT, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencencephalography (EEG), and 12 subtypes of MRI, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), arterial spin labeling (ASL) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, collectively, these studies have examined mTBI at both acute and chronic stages of the injury. In reviewing the literature, it is important to note that the time post-injury of a study can affect its participant exclusion criterion, leading to prospective and symptomatic mTBI groups ( ). In prospective mTBI studies, the exclusion criteria are independent from mTBI (e.g. specific age ranges or drug dependences). Symptomatic mTBI studies recruit chronic participants. Based on estimated recovery rates, this corresponds to effectively excluding the majority of those who sustain mTBIs. In other words, studies of symptomatic groups enroll participants because they have lingering complaints caused (presumably) by their head injury, whereas prospective studies recruit based on mTBI records at the time of concussion (before any chronic mTBI is known). \n\nThis paper broadly reviews mTBI neuroimaging studies of structure and function to highlight the tremendous effort that has taken place to investigate the spectrum of acute to chronic time scales. We additionally provide meta-analyses to examine the current utility of MRI for studying both structure and function. In terms of structure, some reports claim that MRI is more sensitive to detect complicated mTBI than CT ( ). Similar to other authors, we use complicated mTBI to include the broad range of abnormalities that lead to non-negative imaging results ( ). It should be pointed out that definitions of \u2018mild\u2019 vary widely among both clinicians and researchers. Thus while many studies exclude participants with imaging findings, this is not universally the case. Among the other neuroimaging methods, it is also unique in that it can be used to study both structure and function. Many physical parameters provide MRI with a wide range of contrast mechanisms, enabling \u201ctraditional\u201d T1- and T2-weighted structural scans, neural correlates of brain function using fMRI, white-matter microstructure by diffusion MRI, and biochemistry through MR spectroscopy. Thus our meta-analyses focus on three areas of MRI study. The first meta-analysis is motivated by the heterogeneity of fMRI findings and focuses on the question of anatomical consistency for fMRI. Similarly, the second analysis examines the issue of white matter vulnerability to mTBI. Looking at anatomically localized findings, previous neuroimaging data suggest that anterior regions of the brain are more vulnerable to abnormalities ( ). However, published reports are highly heterogeneous in their findings of regional white matter changes. Thus we examined whether anatomical consistency in mTBI lesions exists in the literature. \n\nOur third meta-analysis examines the apparent inconsistency in diffusion-based anisotropy findings across studies that has led to debates about whether or not anisotropy values increase, decrease, or even change at all after mTBI ( ) as well as whether anisotropy levels positively or negatively correlate with performance levels in neuropsychological assessments ( ). Recent reports suggest that it is important to consider the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging ( ). For example,   suggest that anisotropy is increased in the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase in symptomatic TBI patients. Similarly   note that anisotropy values can be either reduced or increased in semi-acute time points, but tend to be decreased in later, chronic stages of symptomatic mTBI. Based on these considerations, we tested the hypotheses that anisotropy is increased in the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis that considered the time post-injury of each study's mTBI cohort. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data collection \n  \nWe queried PubMed ( ) for articles on imaging-based mTBI studies. The authors extracted key information from these articles and entered items into a LimeSurvey database ( ) that we developed for this study. LimeSurvey is an open source web-based survey application that features an unlimited number of participants in a survey (in our case, each paper constituted a survey participant) and flexible export functions to multiple text and software formats. The LimeSurvey web interface enabled the authors to collaborate from different locations. Data from the articles were manually entered into LimeSurvey and these data were examined and summarized using custom-built Python parsing scripts. See Supplementary Materials for the actual survey we used for each paper. \n\nWe examined publications spanning 21 years from 1990 to 2011 using a query focused on mTBI and neuroimaging:  \n(mTBI or \u201cmild traumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cpost concussive syndrome\u201d or \u201cpost concussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussive syndrome\u201d) and (neuroimaging or \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d or MRI or \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d or PET or magnetoencephalography or MEG or electroencephalography or EEG or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or fMRI or \u201cdiffusion tensor imaging\u201d or DTI or T2 or \u201cdiffusion spectrum imaging\u201d or DSI or \u201cdiffusion weighted imaging\u201d or DWI or SWI or \u201csusceptibility weighted imaging\u201d or \u201cT2*\u201d or \u201cCT\u201d or \u201ccomputed tomography\u201d or FLAIR or \u201cdiffusion kurtosis imaging\u201d or \u201cdiffusional kurtosis imaging\u201d or DKI or \u201csingle photon emission computed tomography\u201d or SPECT or NIRS or \u201cnear-infrared spectroscopy\u201d or fNIRS or \u201cfunctional near-infrared spectroscopy\u201d or \u201cresting state\u201d or \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d or \u201cdefault mode network\u201d) and (\u201c1990\u201d [Publication Date]: \u201c2011\u201d [Publication Date]). \n \n\nOur search date was November 11, 2011. This query resulted in 298 publications from which we excluded 176, using seven exclusion criteria. Specifically, we excluded 85 review articles, 47 non-imaging articles (most of which mentioned CT in relation to subjects' TBI status, but without any association to a statistical variable), 13 case studies, 12 animal studies, 9 articles that mixed mTBI with moderate/severe TBI or PTSD, 7 articles that were not in English, and 3 others (a video article, a fatigue article, and a mold exposure article). See Table S1 for a full listing of the 122 publications that we included \n\nWe extracted the following into the LimeSurvey database: 1) Time after concussion (the median/mean time between injury and neuroimaging). If studies were longitudinal or had multiple groups of subjects, multiple time points were reported. 2) Range of time after concussion (the minimum and maximum time between injury and neuroimaging). In publications where only standard deviations were provided, we approximated the range as the median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 standard deviations. Note that this is analogous to the 90% confidence interval. 3) Number of subjects (sum of mTBI and control groups). Note that some publications (such as longitudinal studies) included multiple separated time points. 4) Imaging modality (CT, 12 subtypes of MRI including DTI and fMRI, PET, SPECT, MEG, EEG and near infrared spectrometry). 5) Hypothesized effect of mTBI motivating the imaging study, which we termed the \u201ctheme.\u201d For example, several studies hypothesized that mTBI would lead to white matter abnormalities, and thus to characterize this they measured anisotropy. In contrast, studies that hypothesized that connectivity would be affected, could address this research \u201ctheme\u201d not only by using diverse measures including fMRI but also diffusion imaging-based tractography. 6) Other imaging results (anatomical coordinates, ROIs with significant anisotropy, and other parameters). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe fMRI meta-analysis used Ginger ALE ( ). All fMRI coordinates were converted into Talairach space. We used the default Ginger ALE parameters ( ), and additionally added the number of subjects per experiment. We chose a false discovery rate threshold level of 0.05. We used all available fMRI publications of mTBI, most of which used working memory tasks, but the tasks also included resting state fMRI, an auditory odd-ball task, and a spatial navigation task ( ). Only coordinates from contrast images using two-sample test (mTBI and control) were included. AFNI ( ) was used to present fMRI meta-analysis images in Talairach space. \n\nFor the DTI meta-analyses, each reported region of interest (ROI) was coded using the ICBM-81 atlas ( ). ROIs that were outside of this atlas were only used in the analyses involving time post-injury and omitted for the spatial DTI analysis. Most publications reported FA values, however we also included studies that reported relative anisotropy (RA). Publications found anisotropy differences in two predominant ways \u2014 either categorically (by examining anisotropy means between mTBI and control groups), or parametrically (through regression analyses correlating anisotropy values with neuropsychological performance). AFNI ( ) was used to present DTI meta-analysis results in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. \n\nAs in other publications that account for diverse sets of assessment scores ( ), we normalized neuropsychological results using algebraic negation (multiplying the original score with a negative one) such that better performance corresponds to positive scores. For example, we did not transform results from the California verbal learning test in which scores should be higher for normal performance than for impaired performance, but we did transform (negate) completion time for the Trail making A test (in this case, better raw scores are lower, corresponding to faster completion times). Our motivation for doing this was that it enables us to unambiguously discuss negative and positive correlations between neuropsychological results with changes in imaging measures. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neuroimaging literature \n  \nThe number of mTBI publications has dramatically increased over the past two decades.  A shows the number of publications with respect to time for the neuroimaging articles we analyzed in the context of mTBI research as a whole. The more general mTBI PubMed search in  A excluded our neuroimaging keywords (to include both imaging and non-imaging studies). Specifically, we used (mTBI or \u201cmild traumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cpost concussive syndrome\u201d or \u201cpost concussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussive syndrome\u201d) and (\u201c1990\u201d[Publication Date]: \u201c2011\u201d[Publication Date]). The figure shows that the rate of mTBI publications has been increasing over time, with a notable upsurge occurring around 2007.  B classifies imaging modalities of the publications we analyzed over time. Most of the imaging modalities are MRI-based. The number of studies relying (at least in part) on CT is relatively large, primarily because it is used ubiquitously (and almost exclusively) in emergency room settings. Thus, CT was used as part of the clinical characterization of the subjects in many studies. The functional modalities (EEG/MEG, fMRI, SPECT/PET, and ASL) have been steadily used during the time period shown. \n\n show that structural and functional neuroimaging studies have examined mTBI across acute to chronic time scales with a wide range of imaging modalities. It is important to note that the number of subjects in these publications represents the total number of mTBI and control participants for each experiment, which could include different participant cohorts. Note too, that many experiments have large variability for subjects' post-injury data collection times. Also, while the number of subjects includes control participants, for obvious reasons these controls did not contribute to the post-injury collection times in these  . Focusing on some observations from each figure,   shows that CT studies have been performed on both small and large cohorts, but the majority of these studies occur soon after injury, usually using the subjects' clinical CTs. DTI and the other structural modalities have a much better coverage of the time post-injury. For  , one observation is that many EEG studies also occur soon after injury but in contrast to CT, EEG has also been broadly applied to the entire time course post-injury and to a large number of subjects.   also shows that task-based fMRI has been similarly broadly applied, while resting state fMRI studies have predominantly focused on acute and semi-acute time ranges. PET, ASL, CE-MRI and MEG seem to be rarely used. In addition, there is a lack of PET studies of acute mTBI and both PET and MRS publications used groups that were smaller than 40 subjects. \n\nThe research areas of neuroimaging studies tend to follow distinct structural and functional categories as shown in  . As mentioned previously, CT was used as part of the clinical characterization of the subjects in many studies. In papers where CT was a research focus, it was used to examine structural abnormalities arising from mTBI. Although the category of \u201cmild\u201d TBI sometimes includes the stipulation of negative findings, CTs can nonetheless be used to detect abnormalities from a wide range of trauma severities that appear as hyper- or hypo-intensities observed in gray matter or white matter regions as well as hematomas, cerebral swelling, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Gray matter is composed largely of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, and the capillaries. White matter abnormalities are thought to reflect stretched or sheared axon bundles or abnormal cellular microstructures. Abnormalities not clearly falling into the categories of hematomas or white/gray matter findings have been designated as \u201ccomplicated mTBI\u201d in  . Complicated mTBI was examined fifty-six times in our publication sample, mainly using CT and MRI. Gray matter (GM) abnormalities were only reported in one T1 and one CT study. Abnormal blood brain barrier (BBB) permeabilities were reported by three publications using SPECT and CT (CT studies also detected tau/S100b proteins in blood). White matter (WM) abnormalities were examined thirty-eight times (primarily with DTI). Hematomas were only reported in two CT-based studies. Metabolites were analyzed by a PET, a SPECT and five MRS publications. Perfusion was examined by one PET, one ASL and twelve SPECT publications. Task-based imaging was used in seventeen fMRI and fifteen EEG studies, often linking tasks to brain activity. Connectivity analyses were examined twenty-seven times, detecting low frequency activity, connectivity differences between neural regions, EEG pathologies, altered resting state networks (using fMRI), and connectivity maps (using white matter tractography). Neuropsychological assessments were used in seventy-two publications and were the one theme of investigation (despite not relying on any particular imaging modality itself) that spanned all structural and functional modalities. \n\n\n### fMRI meta-analysis \n  \n display results from our MRI meta-analyses (see also downloadable image files in Supplemental data).   shows results from a Ginger ALE analysis of the fMRI publications summarized in  .   also examines how many independent publications support each ALE peaks. The analysis produced six regions that were consistently more active in mTBI compared to control groups and seven regions with lower activity for mTBI. Spatially, these regions suggest an anterior-to-posterior pattern in which activity is reduced in anterior regions and increased in posterior regions. Of the seven regions with decreased mTBI activity, six were in the frontal lobe or anterior cingulate, with the remaining one being relatively posterior (temporal lobe/BA 39). The regions with increased mTBI activity consisted of two coordinates in the cerebellum, two insula regions, and two foci in the parietal lobe (BA 40). The mean Talairach anterior-to-posterior coordinate for regions with reduced activity was Y\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0mm, compared to Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a023 for increased mTBI activity, and a two-sample   t  -test of Y between the decreased and increased regions was significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05, two tailed). \n\n\n### Anatomical frequency of anisotropy findings \n  \nClose examination of the number and anatomical locations of publications reporting white matter abnormalities revealed significant anatomical heterogeneity as shown in  . See   for white matter regions in the ICBM-81 atlas as well as their abbreviations and center-of-mass coordinates. It is important to note that several ICBM-81 regions have not been reported by the publications we examined. These include the pontine crossing tract, medial lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncle, cerebral peduncle, posterior thalamic radiation, cingulum to hippocampus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, tapetum, and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. These unreported regions were coded in two ways; both leading to statistically significant correlations between anatomical location, along anterior-to-posterior gradient, and the number of abnormalities. Specifically, we calculated a Spearman correlation 1) omitting these regions from the statistical test (using only regions that had reported abnormal findings in the literature) resulting in a \u03c1 \u00a0=\u00a00.26 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.026); and 2) including the unreported regions (coding their frequency as zero) resulting in a \u03c1 \u00a0=\u00a00.32 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0025). We did not find significant correlations in the inferior-to-superior or left-to-right directions. Laterality of the regions was also not significant. \n\n\n### Anisotropy changes depend on imaging time post-injury \n  \nBased on observations by   as well as  , we wanted to examine the hypothesis that anisotropy would be elevated at acute time points and depressed post acutely.   demonstrates the critical importance of accounting for the time post-injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. Shown are the time-resolved anisotropy results for each study. In  A, studies compared mTBI groups to control groups. In  B, studies correlated mTBI anisotropy values with neuropsychological performance. Note that some publications report experimental results at two different chronological points ( ) and thus are represented by two bars. Another complication with the literature is that some research groups seem to have used overlapping mTBI cohorts across publications (see potential overlap in boxed bars in  ). Thus counting each bar in   as an independent measure likely leads to inflated estimates of significance. To account for this, we report the most conservative statistical estimate by using each boxed group as a single experiment. As shown, elevated anisotropy values are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI (<\u00a02\u00a0weeks), while depressed anisotropy findings are reported more frequently for post-acute mTBI (>\u00a02\u00a0weeks). In  A, a two-sample   t  -test confirms that anisotropy is greater in the acute phase (one-tailed, 14 DOF, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In  B, acute phase anisotropy was also significantly anti-correlated with neuropsychological performance compared to a predominant positive correlation in the post acute phase (one-tailed, 7 DOF, p\u00a0<\u00a00.006). Finally, to put these results into the context of the literature, it is important to note that the participant populations were recruited using different criteria in the acute and chronic periods. Specifically, all of the acute studies recruited prospective mTBI subjects, the majority of whom would be expected to recover from their injuries. Conversely, many of the post-acute mTBI studies of anisotropy selected for symptomatic subjects. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAn obvious key limitation of this paper (and any review that attempts to report a snapshot of a vibrant field) is that components of it are immediately outdated. Although we believe that the conclusions we draw here will be qualitative accurate for the next few years, the literature we sampled just barely supported any meaningful fMRI meta-analyses, and the issue of the anisotropy values' dependence on time post-injury is far from conclusive. Part of what we have hoped to accomplish here is an assessment of the modalities, questions, and times post-injury that recent publications have examined. Based on this we hope that research teams can use this to strategically bolster areas of this field that would most benefit from additional effort. We are optimistic that we and/or others will improve our literature analysis approaches in the future to continue what has the potential to become an ongoing, reflective process. \n\nOur review of the mTBI literature highlights the fact that currently about 1/10th of published studies have a human neuroimaging component and that several small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points have been conducted. These studies have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Indeed, in addition to highlighting the fact that research topics have largely (but not exclusively) fallen into either structural or functional categories and providing a sense of the proportion of work that has been devoted to the two,   strikingly shows that neuropsychology appears to be the predominant commonality across the imaging literature. This underscores the fact that mTBI neuroimaging efforts have prioritized attempting to link brain measurements with neuropsychological assessments. Despite the large efforts to date, neuroimaging methods still lack the individual patient-level sensitivity and specificity to serve as a diagnostic tool for mTBI. Similar to other reviews in this area ( ), we believe that ultimate motivations for further neuroimaging work are to provide data to predict an individual's recovery, measure her/his transient and persistent cognitive deficits at a level that compliments or exceeds the sensitivity of neuropsychiatric testing, and quantifies the success of cognitive and drug-based interventions ( ). In the meantime, the field needs further effort to provide stronger correlative understanding of the relationships between neuroimaging and neuropsychiatry, and simultaneously both types of measures also need improvement. \n\nOur fMRI and DTI meta-analyses show, however, that there is hope for consistent neuroimaging markers of structure and function. The fMRI meta-analysis results in   and   show a frontal vulnerability in mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal compared to controls. fMRI studies consistently report decreased activity in mTBI in frontal regions such as right MFG, ACC, and right precentral gyrus. Our finding of bilateral decreases in DLPFC is consistent with three published studies ( ). The DLPFC may be related with working memory. Specific localization of working memory intense regions was found in non-human research ( ) and in humans using fMRI ( ). Even though DLPFC responds to working memory it is a very complex region and serves a multitude of cognitive functions ( ). Interestingly, among the most significant mTBI increases, right cerebellar tonsil and left culmen, were noted in four independent publications ( ).  , has noted that the cerebellum has been implicated for regulating behavior, working memory, and other aspects of executive control. In addition, it has long been recognized that cerebellar lesions can lead to postural deficits ( ), which is a prominent issue in mTBI ( ). Finally, it is important to note that the well-known fMRI issue of multiple comparisons correction may be a limitation of our Ginger ALE analysis. Most of the publications that we used corrected their findings for multiple comparisons. However, notable exceptions include   and  . Although the predominance of anterior fMRI and DTI findings suggests that frontal areas are more vulnerable to injury, we have not ruled out other possible explanations with this current study (for example, it is possible that there is a sampling bias in the literature, which favors injury mechanisms that lead to more injuries in prefrontal cortex). Another limitation of this fMRI meta-analysis is that, unlike the diffusion-weighted literature, the number of fMRI studies published did not have power enough for an fMRI analysis using time post-injury. We feel that \u201ctime-resolving\u201d fMRI studies could be an important area for future investigation. \n\nStructurally, diffusion weighted imaging is currently one of the most promising techniques for characterizing the subtle and heterogeneous changes that occur with mTBI. Note Supplemental Table 2 lists specific details about the studies used to generate  .   demonstrates that differences in the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy values have an anterior to posterior gradient. Taken independently, each DTI study shows white matter differences that seem to be sporadic. When integrating across all reported findings, though, these frequencies of abnormalities have a systematic spatial distribution corroborating previous suggestions that anterior regions of the brain are more vulnerable to abnormalities ( ). Anterior regions may also be related with executive/cognitive function disabilities in mTBI ( ). \n\nUsing the existing literature to time-resolve results,   suggests that white matter anisotropy can serve as an important potential marker of both chronic symptoms as well as of an acute response to secondary injuries. Taken together, the literature demonstrates that elevated anisotropy values (and negative correlations with neuropsychological performance) are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI, while depressed anisotropy findings (and positive correlations with neuropsychological performance) are reported more frequently for chronic studies. Our analyses show that elevated anisotropy values are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI, while depressed anisotropy findings are reported more frequently for post-acute studies, corroborating conjectures of   and  . Thus,   helps to clarify an apparent inconsistency in the literature about anisotropy changes after mTBI by \u201ctime resolving\u201d the results. In addition,  B raises important new questions about the interactions of anisotropy, neuropsychological performance, and time post-injury. In particular, the fact that cognitive performance is negatively correlated with anisotropy during acute stages, but positively correlated with anisotropy chronically is puzzling. \n\nAt least two issues remain outstanding with the results in  . The first is the inconsistency in  A of the results for paper XXI ( ). In discussing their results,   are careful to point out that the small sample size of their study calls for more future work. However, they also suggest potential explanations for their findings, including the possibility that the observed increases in FA could reflect recovery from injury; or that specific degradation mechanisms could target subsets of fibers, leading to enhanced FA; or, finally, that the increases in FA are compensatory for other observed decreases in other brain regions. The second issue relates to the heterogeneity of the neuropsychological testing in the papers used to generate  B. Thus a limitation in the literature (and in our results) is the lack of consistency of neuropsychological assessment. As previously mentioned, we have \u201cnormalized\u201d the scores such that better performance corresponds to a positive score, regardless of what test was used. We note, however, in light of the literature's \u201cuncontrolled assessment variance\u201d, that our results are conservative as well as robust across cognitive domains and testing variability. Undoubtedly, though, more sensitive, standardized assessments that are specifically adapted to mTBI are needed to further reduce the limitations of these types of studies. \n\nThe results of   and the outstanding issues that we have raised suggest that more studies focused on mTBI and anisotropy are warranted and necessary. At this point we can only conjecture on possible explanations for our meta-analysis results. One possibility for the increase in FA acutely is that MR diffusion-based measurements are not purely sensitive to white matter microstructure, but additionally are inflated by acute stage secondary injury or compensatory mechanisms ( ). The idea behind this is that inflammation and secondary injury factors (including ischemia, cerebral hypoxia, and cerebral edema) may increase anisotropy in acute phase, but that these factors do not contribute in the chronic phase. Chronically, though, residual damage of white matter could lead to a decreased anisotropy signal. A second possible explanation of  B, however, is that there is not a simple causal relationship between anisotropy and cognitive performance. Whatever the mechanism,  B indicates that poor neuropsychological performance is associated with high anisotropy scores immediately after injury and with low anisotropy in the chronic phase. From a statistical point of view,  A demonstrates a main effect between anisotropy and time post-injury, but  B additionally indicates an interaction with cognitive performance. We have previously mentioned that there is controversy surrounding anisotropy changes after TBI. Nonetheless   note in their review of the literature a general acceptance that decreases in FA values are expected after TBI induced axonal injury. However, they also point out that mechanisms for increases in FA are also possible (e.g. unequal injury in one fiber in voxels where two or more fibers cross). Furthermore, there are examples in other disorders (such as autism) where widespread differences have been noted in the relationship of FA with cognitive function ( ). Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of anisotropy changes following TBI will likely need to rely on methods and validation studies in animal models such as those of   and   to relate pathology to diffusion tensor imaging findings. Finally, the majority of the literature focuses on FA, but some publications report radial diffusion (RD), axial diffusion (AD) and mean diffusion (MD) diffusion as well. The four measures are related to each other and usually FA and AD are significant in the same direction while MD and RD tend to be significant in the opposite direction. Results of these measures are found in supplemental Table S2. \n\nTo summarize, this review and meta-analysis have demonstrated several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. A broad range of neuroimaging modalities are being applied to this problem across the range of post-injury time scales and an important component of many studies is the effort to link imaging measurements to neuropsychological assessments of cognitive deficits. Upon closer scrutiny of two MRI-based modalities, we demonstrated the importance of interpreting white-matter measures of anisotropy in the context of time post-injury and for both structure and function we evaluated whether or not consistent findings were available for evaluating anatomical vulnerability to mTBI. The fact that we have been able to produce statistically significant results in this area is encouraging. Based on the complexity of the injury, however, much more work in this area is required. Future publications focused in depth for each image modality would greatly complement this generic analysis and the field of mTBI. Here we have been able to preliminarily examine important factors related to anatomical vulnerability and time post-injury, but these issues need to be refined with future data and many other factors remain to be studied (e.g. injury mechanism differences, number and timing of previous concussions, and psychological comorbidities including major depression and post-traumatic stress) ( ). Ultimately a major driving motivation for continued study is the further efficacy of neuroimaging for clinical diagnosis at both acute and chronic stages and the synergistic improvement with neuropsychological assessments and rehabilitation strategies. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4107372, "text_md5": "4142e221c0e9246f788939a121cf9a60", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 139], "journal": [140, 155], "publication_year": [157, 161], "title": [172, 245], "keywords": [259, 366], "abstract": [379, 3002], "body": [3011, 40638]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 25061565, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2013.12.009", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4107372", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4107372"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4107372\">4107372</a>", "list_title": "PMC4107372  Neuroimaging after mild traumatic brain injury: Review and meta-analysis\u2606"}

To date, others assume that hemispheric specialisation of the IPL is linked with the type of processing; attention processing in the right hemisphere; memory retrieval and semantic judgement in the left hemisphere. Here, we provide compelling evidence associating the type of information being processed with the recruitment of each hemisphere\u2019s IPL. In a meta-analysis, we classify 121 previous fMRI reports of IPL activity arising from episodic memory retrieval, according to the type of information that characterises each fMRI contrast. We demonstrate that the left IPL is more consistently associated with retrieval of the semantic (95% of eligible contrasts) than perceptual aspects of memory (83%). In contrast, the right IPL is more consistently associated with the retrieval of perceptual (97%), than semantic aspects of memory (43%). This work revises assumptions of how the IPL contributes to healthy cognition and has major implications for IPL-related neuropsychological deficits. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOur understanding of the complex brain systems that support the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memory, the what, where, and when of life\u2019s events, has vastly improved with the advent of neuroimaging. However, for the last 15\u00a0years, the functional role played by the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), which includes the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, in the retrieval of episodic memory has been the source of contentious debate . Numerous functions, including the successful retrieval of episodic memories, have been strongly associated with activity in the IPL . Despite the consistency of this association, an intriguing disconnect exists between the seemingly minimal effects of damage to the IPL on patients\u2019 memory, and the IPL activity consistently observed during the retrieval of episodic memory in healthy participants . \n\nMemory researchers have offered several hypotheses to account for this theoretical discord between human lesion and neuroimaging observations . Recently, Humphreys & Lambon Ralph  considered these hypotheses and their supporting data together to generate the Parietal Unified Connectivity-biased Computation (PUCC) framework. Although PUCC provides interpretations of much of the data pertaining to parietal lobe functions, the framework, like most others that preceded it, provides limited insight into why neuroimaging studies frequently report parietal cortex activations that are lateralised to a single hemisphere of the brain. In this article, we consider previous models of parietal function and perform a meta-analysis to directly investigate this hemispheric lateralisation and its causes. \n\nThe attention to memory (AToM) model of parietal cortex function is one perspective that has divided scientific opinion, and both support and criticism has been provided by a mixture of investigative methods . The AToM model proposes that the IPL performs a similar function in both spatial attention and memory retrieval . Subregions within the IPL have been shown to regulate the reflexive allocation of attention to salient information  and the AToM model proposes that the IPL supports bottom-up allocation of resources to the salient contents of medial temporal lobe output. More recent evidence has, however, identified spatial activation differences between IPL subregions that were separately associated with the allocation of attention and episodic memory retrieval . These studies have shown that the AToM model is likely to be an overly simplistic explanation of IPL function. Building on the episodic buffer hypothesis , the PUCC framework suggests instead that reflexive attention capture to sensory perceptions or episodic memories may emerge intrinsically as a function of the IPL integrating the spatial or temporal state of new perceptual or memory information with that of the current context . Though more contemporary models explain parietal function more completely, the AToM model introduced the important idea that features of parietal function observed in one domain could be extrapolated to explain another . This idea was central to the development of our working definitions of perceptually and semantically-defined memory experiences which we describe below. \n\nIt is well established that healthy individuals implicitly and preferentially allocate more spatial attention to the left visual field than the right; a phenomenon known as pseudoneglect (e.g. ). A large body of research attributes this effect to the specialisation of attention allocation processing by the right ventral attention network, including the IPL (e.g.  ). Pseudoneglect represents an example of a behavioural manifestation of hemispheric specialisation in these brain regions that might also be observed in memory. In contrast, the left hemisphere generally shows an obvious specialisation in language and semantic processing . This specialisation has also been linked closely with the IPL with specific reference to the computation of word and sentence-level semantic information . Here, we investigate the previous claim that memory retrieval processes also exhibit hemispheric specialisation of IPL function in the left hemisphere and propose a different specialisation based on the informational content of the representation being remembered. \n\nWe ask whether the hemispheric specialisations of the IPL, previously observed for spatial attention allocation  and semantic processing  are also evident for episodic memory processing. We performed a meta-analysis of previous fMRI investigations of episodic memory retrieval that observed IPL activations. These highly variable previous studies were classified according to whether they assessed the retrieval of either perceptual/experiential or semantic/conceptual aspects of episodic memories. As spatial attention allocation is intrinsically linked to the perceptual processing of incoming sensory information, predominantly in the visual domain, we hypothesised that the IPL shares a common hemispheric specialisation for retrieving detailed perceptual information from episodic memory and processing spatial attention. Similarly, we predicted that common hemispheric specialisations would be evident in the IPL during the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information from episodic memory and the processing of language. Accordingly, conditions in which performance depended on memory for the perceptual details of the original encounter, rather than semantic concepts, were expected to engage the right hemisphere IPL more than the left. Conversely, we expected left hemisphere IPL activations to be more prevalent than the right during semantic/conceptual retrieval of episodic memories. \n\nMemory assessments were classified according to both the informational content of the memory that had been encoded and the specific requirements of the retrieval challenge at test. A perceptually defined memory experience was characterised by two primary features: 1) the encoding of detailed sensory information, most often in the visual domain, and 2) memory tests in which accurate performance was highly dependent on re-experiencing sensory information. For example, the detailed perceptual features of the encoded item (e.g. a semi-consumed glass of beer) are crucial to distinguishing between two similar variants of the same item (e.g. distinguishing between that glass of beer and a fuller one). Two very different criteria were used to classify a semantically/conceptually defined memory experience: (1) information stored in memory with limited perceptual detail, and (2) memory tests in which accurate performance could be achieved through memory for a semantic or conceptual label alone. For example, without needing to draw on the raw percept that led to that memory, one may accurately recognise that they had encountered the concept \u2018beer\u2019 earlier. To summarise, our classifications were based on the stimuli, encoding challenge, and retrieval challenge as well as the information represented in the fMRI contrast of interest (e.g., recall of visual features\u2009>\u2009narrative information would be classified as a perceptually defined memory experience). \n\n\n## Methods\u2014meta-analysis of IPL episodic retrieval memory effect \n  \n### Identification and eligibility \n  \nThe process of identification, screening, and classification of eligible studies to create a representative sample of the literature is illustrated in the PRISMA 2009 flow diagram Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . A brief summary of the encoding and retrieval methods, specific contrasts, and the resulting IPL activations for each study included in the review are provided in Supplementary Table   and  .   \n(  A  ) IPL associated activations in semantically (blue), and perceptually (red) defined memory contrasts mapped onto an inflated template brain. Notes: Large spheres represent activations where the IPL associated activation was also the peak activation. Small spheres represent non-peak activations associated with the IPL. Readers should interpret the precise location of activations with caution as they reflect peak activations rather than illustrating the direction and extent of the activations across the brain. (  B  ) A graphical representation of the percentage of IPL activations in the left and right hemisphere associated with semantically, and perceptually defined memory contrasts. \n  \n\nStudies published prior to October 2019 were identified through   searches. We targeted studies written in the English language for assessment of eligibility using the terms: memory, retrieval, fMRI and then checked that the abstracts of articles matching these keywords were episodic memory research. Where it was unclear in the abstract whether relevant data would be available, the full manuscript was assessed for eligibility. Studies included in the analysis contained at least one univariate episodic memory contrast with an activation specifically reported in the angular gyrus and/or supramarginal gyrus of the left and/or right hemisphere. \n\n\n### Classification \n  \nA total of 65 eligible studies provided 121 contrasts for our analyses. We made a binary distintion (see our criteria above) between episodic memory contrasts that probed predominantly semantic/conceptual information at retrieval (76 contrasts) and those that required the retrieval of perceptual details (45 contrasts). Our criteria for classification were established and agreed collectively (OG and DM). A set of five studies (indicated in Supplementary Tables   and  ) were then used as a training set to improve the consistency of the classifications across the reviewers (OG, LF, DM). Two training studies were chosen randomly from each of the preliminary perceptual and semantic classifications of OG. A third study (Dobbins et al  .  ) was chosen deliberately to illustrate that our classifications should focus on fMRI contrasts rather than fMRI studies, and thus a single study could contribute both a perceptually and semantically defined contrast to the analysis. The classification of each contrast was then performed independently by each reviewer. Importantly, LF was blind to our hypotheses regarding the hemispheric specialisation of the IPL. After each reviewer had assessed and reported all contrasts, the reviewers met to discuss each contrast which was not agreed upon by all three reviewers (21 contrasts, OG-LF\u201416, DM-LF\u201414, OG-DM\u20149). After discussion and clarification of details of the tasks and contrasts reported in the respective papers, all these discrepancies were resolved. \n\nWe then further delineated the contrasts by considering the extent of the contribution of semantic and perceptual information to the memory retrieved. Each imaging contrast was rated 1 to 5, where 1\u2009=\u2009definitively semantic retrieval, 2\u2009=\u2009semantic retrieval with some perceptual retrieval, 3\u2009=\u2009a near equal contribution of semantic and perceptual retrieval, 4\u2009=\u2009perceptual retrieval with some semantic retrieval, 5\u2009=\u2009definitively perceptual retrieval. \n\nWe also performed a further classification of perceptually and semantically defined retrieval contrasts, based on the contribution of recall/recollection or familiarity memory processing. This utilised the definitions and reports of these processes provided in the original studies. For this analysis, only contrasts where the memory retrieval episode was clearly more reliant on one type of memory (e.g. a remember\u2009>\u2009know paradigm) were included. Contrasts characterised by approximately matched levels of the same process (e.g. matched recollection\u2014source memory for words that were seen\u2009>\u2009source memory for words that were heard) were excluded. We also excluded contrasts without a clear contribution of one of these processes over the other (e.g. recognition hits\u2009>\u2009correct rejections). \n\nLastly, we recorded the type of stimulus being remembered (visually presented words, images, other), the date of publication of each study, and we rated the stringency of the correction for multiple comparisons applied to each contrast of interest on a scale from 1\u20135: 1\u2009=\u2009the most lenient corrections; 5\u2009=\u2009the most stringent corrections. We differentiated between contrasts that utilised a lenient threshold (e.g.   p  \u2009<\u2009.05) and were uncorrected for multiple comparisons (1); contrasts with an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and uncorrected cluster threshold (2); more stringent voxelwise and/or cluster extent thresholds without reference to false discovery rates (FDR) or family-wise error (FWE) corrections (3); voxelwise or cluster extent thresholds with FDR corrections (4); and those contrasts with family-wise error (FWE) corrected (voxelwise/cluster extent) thresholds (5). \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \nThe presence of IPL activation in each hemisphere was classified as the dependent variable. We assessed factors potentially affecting the probability of IPL activation using multiple regression analyses implemented in R  using the glm package. Omnibus likelihood ratio tests and the subsequent assessment of specific model terms were conducted using the nagelkerke and Anova functions implemented in the rcompanion and car packages respectively . Pseudo-R  values were calculated using the nagelkerke function. These regression analyses assessed the probability of IPL activation in each hemisphere according to the contrast\u2019s classification as semantically or perceptually-defined, the type of stimulus used, the year of publication of the associated study, and the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons. Assessment of the relationship between memory processes (e.g. recall) and IPL activations was excluded from the multiple regression analyses because of the limited availability of data in some conditions. Instead, summary comparisons of this data are provided in the results section. To ensure that our effects were not driven by multiple contrasts generated by one group of subjects from a single study, we generated bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals using the boot package . This bootstrap approach used the strata function to repeatedly estimate the regression fit using a sample of one randomly selected contrast from each study. In Supplementary Table 1 and 2, we provide details of each contrast of interest, including the encoding and retrieval procedures that were performed by participants. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nImaging contrasts of memory paradigms that require retrieval of perceptual information show activation of the right IPL in 96% (43/45) of cases. The same contrasts elicit left IPL activations in 77% (35/45) of cases. Instead, during the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information, the left IPL is active far more consistently, 97% (74/76), than the same cortical area in the right hemisphere, 43% (33/76). Figure\u00a0 B illustrates the proportion of these semantically, and perceptually defined imaging contrasts that were associated with IPL activations in each hemisphere. Importantly, the stringency of corrections for multiple comparisons did not explain these differences. In the most stringently thresholded contrasts (ratings 4 & 5), paradigms requiring retrieval of perceptual information showed right IPL activation in 97% (34/35) of cases. Similarly, less stringently corrected contrasts (ratings 1 & 2) showed right IPL activiation in 80% (8/10) of cases. We identified left IPL activation in 82% (29/35) of stringent and 60% (6/10) of lenient perceptually-defined contrasts. Contrasts involving the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information displayed left IPL activation in 93% (31/33) of stringent and 100% of lenient cases. In contrast, the right IPL displayed activation in only 42% of stringent and 45% of lenient contrasts requiring semantic or conceptual information retrieval. \n\nTwo separate multiple logistic regression analyses assessed the probability of IPL activation in each hemisphere (one analysis per hemisphere) according to the contrast\u2019s binary classification (semantic/perceptual), the stimulus type (visually presented words/images/other), the year of publication of the associated study, and the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons (1\u2014least stringent to 5\u2014most stringent). Both of these models both explained significantly more variance than a comparable null model (probability of left IPL activation\u2014\u03c7 (df H -H \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200915.03,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.24; probability of right IPL activation\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200922.19,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.41). We observed significantly greater probability of activation in the left hemisphere\u2019s IPL for semantically-defined than perceptual-defined memory retrieval contrasts (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200912.65,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, mean estimate (  M  )\u2009=\u20092.96, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20094.28, CI [1.56, 19.95]). In contrast, probability of activation was significantly greater in the right hemisphere\u2019s IPL for perceptually-defined than semantically-defined memory retrieval contrasts (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200938.77,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.89, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095.01, CI [\u2212\u200920.60, \u2212\u20092.97]). Neither model observed a significant effect of stimulus type (left IPL\u2014\u03c7 (2)\u2009=\u20091.22,   p  \u2009=\u2009.54, average   M  \u2009=\u20090.60, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.80, CI [\u2212\u20091.65, 0.61]; right IPL\u2014\u03c7 (2)\u2009=\u20094.60,   p  \u2009=\u2009.10, average   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.47, average bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.81, CI [\u2212\u200912.60, \u2212\u20090.04]), the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons (left IPL\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20090.84,   p  \u2009=\u2009.35,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.42, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.45, CI [\u2212\u20090.82, \u2212\u20090.02]; right IPL\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20091.68,   p  \u2009=\u2009.19,   M  \u2009=\u20090.28, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.30, CI [0.04, 0.60]), nor the year of publication (left IPL\u2014(\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20091.36,   p  \u2009=\u2009.24,   M  \u2009=\u20090.12, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.12, CI [0.03, 0.23]; right IPL\u2014(\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20090.50,   p  \u2009=\u2009.48,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04, CI [\u2212\u20090.11, 0.02]). \n\nThe analyses presented in this section use our binary classification of episodic memory contrasts as either perceptually-defined or semantically-defined and assess the probability of activation in the IPL as a whole. In Supplementary Analysis 1, we provide the results of further logistic regression analyses that assessed activation probabilities according to our five point ratings (1\u2009=\u2009definitively semantic, 3\u2009=\u2009a near equal contribution, 5\u2009=\u2009definitively perceptual) of the semantic and perceptual contributions to each memory retrieval contrast. In Supplementary Analysis 2, we describe the probability of SMG and ANG activation separately according to both the binary and rating based classifications. In these supplementary analyses, the factors affecting the probability of right IPL activation in the primary analyses were also associated with the probability of activation of both right IPL subregions. The more subtle and noisy effects in the left IPL (see estimates and \u03c7  values, reasons for this additional noise are explored in the discussion) were not observed in the left IPL subregions with the limited power available (average 40% decrease in activation frequency) for these analyses. \n\nWe further explored the extent of the hemispheric lateralisation of IPL function by assessing whether unilateral activations were more probable than bilateral activations for semantically- and perceptually-defined memory retrieval. Multiple regression models assessed this probability according to the same factors described in the main analyses (i.e., the contrast\u2019s classification [semantic/perceptual, binary and 1\u20135 rating based classifications], the stimulus type, the year of publication, and the stringency of multiple comparison correction). Both types of information content classification produced models of unilateral left IPL activation probability that were better than a comparable null model (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200917.86,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.37; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200926.10,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.28). In each of these models, semantically-defined memory retrieval contrasts were more likely than perceptually-defined contrasts to produce unilateral left IPL activations rather than bilateral activations (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200931.35,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20093.65; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200921.73,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20091.20). Our assessment of the probability of unilateral right IPL activity revealed that only the model including our proportion-based classification of semantic/perceptual information content explained significantly more variance than a comparable null model (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u20096.96,   p  \u2009>\u2009.05, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.15; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200911.15,   p  \u2009=\u2009.048, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.23). In the proportion-based classification, right IPL activation was significantly more likely to be unilateral than bilateral with contrasts increasingly defined as more perceptual than semantic (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20099.91,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20091.11). These results provide strong evidence that rather than one type of information content being lateralised to one hemisphere and the other being associated with bilateral activations, semantic and perceptually-defined memory experiences are associated with left and right lateralised IPL activation respectively. Moreover it suggests that bilateral activations are produced by the presence of both types of information content in a memory experience. Full details of these analyses are presented in Supplementary Analysis 3. \n\nThe coordinates of all IPL activations associated with each contrast were recorded, and those contrasts that were given a clear semantic/conceptual classification (ratings 1 and 2, 64 contrasts) or a clear perceptual classification (ratings 4 and 5, 38 contrasts) are mapped onto an inflated template brain shown in Fig.\u00a0 A using the Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Analysis & Visualization Tool (MMVT ). \n\nAs well as classifying fMRI contrasts according to the dominant informational content for each contrast (perceptual or semantic), we also explored whether hemispheric specialisation in the IPL differed according to whether recollection and familiarity memory processing predominated. Direct comparisons are presented here because the limited availability of data in some classifications prevented the regression models from converging on reliable estimates, precluding the factor from inclusion in the analyses. With respect to semantic contrasts, we observed that recall or recollection-based retrieval produced left IPL activations in 96% (27 of 28) of eligible contrasts, whereas the right IPL was only active in 29% of these contrasts (8/28). Semantically defined familiarity memory contrasts displayed the same lateralisation as recollection; the left IPL displayed activation in 100% of these contrasts (12/12), compared with only 33% (4/12) showing right IPL activation. With respect to perceptual contrasts, 91% (20/22) of those involving recollection displayed right IPL activation, while left IPL activation was found in 77% (17/22) of these contrasts. Perceptually defined familiarity memory produced bilateral IPL activations in all 3 relevant contrasts (100%). However, this should be interpreted with great caution due to the small number of data points. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis review has identified a clear relationship between the hemispheric lateralisation of IPL activations and the informational nature of the target memory in fMRI investigations of episodic retrieval. Our findings suggest that the left IPL supports the retrieval of the semantic and conceptual aspects of episodic memory, whereas the right IPL supports in the retrieval of the perceptual features of a memory, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 A. Moreover, the information content of the memory provides a more accurate and complete account of IPL specialisation than the type of stimulus being remembered (e.g. words or images). Hemispheric specialisation in the IPL is well established in both the spatial attention  and language processing  literatures, and the lateralisation pattern we have observed here, whilst produced by different cognitive processes, is highly compatible with this previous work. Whilst clearly recognising the potential anatomic distinction in the IPL between the systems dedicated to different areas of cognitive function , the information content interpretation links the brain mechanisms that support memory retrieval, with those that underpin spatial attention and language processes. \n\nThere are studies that offer a particularly clear insight into the hemispheric specialisation of memory retrieval function in the IPL. Some studies specifically focus on semantically-defined memory experiences and report unilateral left hemisphere IPL activations. For example, Frithsen and Miller  presented participants with noun words and encouraged their encoding using a semantic judgement task. This study reported source recognition related activation in a highly left-hemisphere lateralised network of cortical regions that included the left IPL. Other studies focus specifically on perceptually-defined memory experiences and report unilateral right hemisphere IPL activations. For example, St-Laurent and colleagues  contrasted perceptually rich video clips with minimal dialog with perceptually impoverished narrations of the same events, and Klostermann and colleagues  tested the memory of participants using non-verbal, agrammatical music stimuli. Both studies reported activation of the right, but not left IPL. Interestingly, Dobbins & Wagner  provided an interesting comparison of the episodic retrieval mechanisms associated with semantic and perceptual source memories. A recognition contrast in which subjects recollected items that were encoded with a semantic judgement revealed left hemisphere lateralised activations of the IPL and other nodes of the core recollection network. In contrast, recollection of perceptual features of the memory was associated with comparable areas exclusively in the right hemisphere. The lateralisations described here are typical of those reported in our classifications. \n\nAs might be expected, a large number of contrasts (67/121) showed some bilateral activation of the IPL. We observed strong evidence indicating that, compared with bilateral activations, unilateral IPL activation was more probable in the left hemisphere during semantically-defined memory retrieval and in the right hemisphere during perceptually-defined memory retrieval. We therefore propose that the large number of bilateral activations reflect the presence of both perceptual and semantic information in the retrieved episode; illustrating a characteristic richness of memory that is common to so many episodic memories but is rarely investigated. We analysed the relationship between this memory content and IPL activity from studies across a period of almost twenty years. Many, and particularly early, fMRI experiments have used word stimuli, probably because of the comparative ease with which they could be developed, manipulated, and presented. This accounts for the greater number of contrasts categorised as requiring the retrieval of semantic rather than perceptual information in our analysis (76 semantic contrasts, mean year of publication\u2009=\u20092010, SD\u2009=\u20096\u00a0years, compared with 45 perceptual contrasts, mean year of publication\u2009=\u20092013, SD\u2009=\u20095\u00a0years, see Supplementary Table   &  ). The targeted investigation of the effects of specific kinds of memory retrieval process, (e.g., familiarity), has developed more recently, and this has likely contributed to the surprisingly limited data points on perceptually-based familiarity. \n\nThe angular gyrus is both a subregion of the inferior parietal lobule and a node of the default mode network (DMN) and it exhibits activation with a huge variety of tasks. Interestingly, three functional subregions within the left angular gyrus have been identified . Two of these left-sided subregions have been implicated in a DMN role, where their activity changed in all tasks relative to fixation (increase in dorsomedial angular gyrus activity, decrease in middle angular gyrus activity). However, in the ventrolateral angular gyrus, activity specifically changed with a semantic matching task. Interestingly, a more recent study exploring functional connectivity during episodic retrieval, revealed substantial connectivity between the left angular gyrus and other non-medial temporal cortex nodes of the DMN . In contrast, the right angular gyrus exhibited strong retrieval-related functional connectivity with the medial temporal lobe. Consistent with the research highlighted in this discussion, our targeted review of IPL activations, strongly suggests that the right IPL performs a particularly important functional role in episodic retrieval that until now has lacked widespread appreciation. \n\nMany recognition memory tasks require very little retrieval of the perceptual features of an encoding experience. For example, in a recognition memory paradigm, if we have conceptual memory that a glass of beer was encoded, then remembering precisely what the beer looked like is not critical to its recognition when the beer is presented alongside an apple. Instead, the retrieval of semantic concepts is often sufficient for accurate recognition memory. Therefore, in many of the studies that observe IPL retrieval effects, semantic/conceptual memory alone could support accurate recognition performance. For example, the traditional Yes/No memory task has not utilised similar lures at test as standard. As a result, the representations of encoded and new items are generally semantically very different and can be successfully distinguished by a simple semantic label for each encoded target. As the hippocampus plays a key role in supporting associative memory , it is likely to support the accurate associative retrieval of semantic labels and concepts encountered in a specific encoding context without drawing critically on the IPL. This may explain why patients with IPL lesions do not appear amnesic when assessed with many traditional memory techniques. \n\nLeft hemisphere IPL activations associated with episodic memory retrieval are observed with greater frequency than right IPL activations. We suggest that this difference in frequency of lateralisation reflects the contents of episodic retrieval rather than the selective specialisation of the left IPL for memory retrieval. Additionally, the left IPL is associated with greater connectivity with the DMN than the right IPL . As a result, DMN-related activity that is associated with a factor outside of experimental control, e.g. variability in arousal/task engagement, may elicit left but not right IPL activity and be misattributed as demonstrating specific differences in memory processing between the hemispheres. Unfortunately, the potentially inflated frequency of left IPL activity by DMN functions combined with a lack of focus on the role of the right IPL in memory retrieval has led many recent investigations of IPL memory function to focus solely on the left IPL . This has occurred at the expense of a targeted exploration of the functional role of the right IPL, potentially obscuring the observation of key findings. \n\nIn contrast to those many memory paradigms that can be successfully completed through the retrieval of semantic or conceptual details of an episode, other memory tasks can only be completed through the retrieval of detailed perceptual information from memory. Recognition tasks that use a target and highly similar lures (e.g., four apples) have this requirement . In such tasks, retrieving the label of an object (e.g., apple) does not help the participant to distinguish the target from other similar variants of the same object. Indeed evidence of right hemisphere IPL activations has been observed with this type of task . Dennis et al  .  , used related lures (items within a semantic category, e.g., different cats) and showed greater activity in the right angular gyrus for remember false alarms (recall of some, but not diagnostic, perceptual features) than non-remember false alarms (including guesses). In another study utilising similar lures, the right angular gyrus showed a large activation cluster that was greater for correct rejection (retrieval of perceptual features to reject/detect novelty) than false alarm responses . \n\nInterestingly, causal studies, utilising patients and neurostimulation techniques, have shown evidence of a functional role of the IPL in the retrieval of perceptual experiences . In contrast to memory for semantic/conceptual labels, these studies required retrieval and integration of multiple perceptual features. For example, Davidson et al. , observed that this kind of memory retrieval was impaired in patients with lateral parietal cortex lesions. More specifically, perceptual details of autobiographical recall were reduced despite preserved descriptions of non-specific semantic details. In addition, the patients produced fewer \u2018remember\u2019 responses during a remember/know recognition task. Simons et al  .  , observed that during a recognition memory task, memory confidence but not accuracy, was reduced in patients with IPL damage. Although this was interpreted as an impairment of subjective memory in these patients, a reduction in their objective memory for the perceptual details of these recollections, although not tested, may also explain this effect. Of note, Russell et al  .   recently reported that individuals with right hemisphere IPL damage and without unilateral hemispatial neglect symptoms were specifically impaired in recalling their self-perspective at encoding. Contrastingly, these individuals could recall other information about the episode that could be summarised with a label , potentially enabling functional compensation by the left hemisphere\u2019s IPL. These studies all suggest that perceptual feature information is more susceptible than semantic/conceptual information to memory impairment when IPL function is compromised. The idea that memory retrieval is dynamically modulated by the engagement of the IPL was recently corroborated by examples of augmented memory retrieval abilities following up-regulation of left angular gyrus activity with TMS . Critically, further work should utilise the upregulating TMS approach developed in the lab of Voss and colleagues  with the right hemisphere\u2019s angular gyrus and establish whether this modulates the balance of the retrieval of semantic and/or perceptual aspects of memory. \n\nAdditional causal support for the hemispheric specialisation of IPL processing being dependent on information content is provided by the effect of parietal lesions on different types of paired recall. Levy and colleagues  observed that angular gyrus lesions in particular were associated with pronounced deficits in perceptually-defined memory recall. Moreover, patients with right hemisphere parietal damage and perceptually-defined memory impairments retained, or potentially even improved, their semantically-defined recall abilities (Fig.\u00a08 of  ). The findings of the current meta-analysis, which are not affected by the confounding effects of encoding impairments caused by aphasia and unilateral hemispatial neglect (extremely common in the patient lesion studies of the parietal cortex), together with the data of Levy and colleagues, strongly support the idea of semantic compensation by the left hemisphere\u2019s parietal cortex for deficits in perceptual retrieval. \n\nThe data presented here suggest that the retrieval of memory based on either recollection or familiarity, both exhibit the same pattern of IPL hemispheric specialisation driven by informational content. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the \u201ccortical binding of relational activity\u201d (COBRA)  model and the very similar Contextual Integration Model  of IPL memory function. These models propose that multifaceted information arising from memory is integrated by the IPL during memory retrieval . Whilst these hypotheses offer explanations of memory supported by recollection, they fail to effectively integrate the findings of previous research that has observed IPL activations associated with familiarity-based recognition . In the case of familiarity, incoming information is compared to a stored representation and unlike recollection, does not involve the retrieval of additional information from the study context . As a result, integration of memory components should not be required for familiarity memory. The hypothesis proposed by the episodic buffer model, and more recently adopted into the PUCC framework , states that any output from the MTL (familiarity or recollection) is likely to be temporally or spatially incongruent with the current context and that the IPL works to adapt the information to fit this context. Therefore, it would be interesting if future work directly investigated the effect of manipulating perceptually and semantically defined information content on familiarity memory experiences. Finally, it will be important for future models and frameworks of IPL function to also ensure that activations caused by, and impairments in, recollection and familiarity for both semantically and perceptually-defined memory information are accounted for and explained. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, this review proposes a novel characterisation of the IPL processing involved in the retrieval of rich everyday episodic memories. For the first time, we provide compelling evidence that the IPL of the two hemispheres perform similar but functionally dissociable roles in the retrieval of a complete episodic memory. The left IPL supports the retrieval of the semantic and conceptual aspects of episodic memory, whereas the right IPL supports the retrieval of the perceptual features of the memory. We also provide evidence that this relationship is not driven by differences between types of retrieval process (i.e., recall/recollection or familiarity) or simply by the type of stimulus originally encoded (i.e., words or images) but instead, is driven specifically by mnemonic informational content. \n\nNeuroimaging studies frequently report activation in the IPL across a variety of cognitive functions. Despite these numerous reports and the prevalence of IPL damage in patients with lesions (e.g. stroke) and disease (e.g. dementia), our understanding of its causal role has been limited by a lack of appreciation of those characteristics (e.g. hemispheric specialisation) which are common across cognitive functions. Future work should develop novel and more convergent approaches that utilise the methodological strengths derived from investigating these different cognitive domains. Moreover, it is crucial for a complete understanding of this area, that studies involving the direct modulation of brain activity (e.g. through TMS), target and compare effects of stimulation on   both   hemispheres. Only through this type of careful and strategic investigation, and the use of highly specified and controlled informational content, will we fully understand both the shared and selective roles of the IPL across different cognitive domains. Apart from informing a crucial area of neuroscientific knowledge, this work will be central to realising the enormous potential of therapeutically modulating IPL activity to improve function in the damaged and diseased brain. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7493939, "text_md5": "bb5002fea9a6fad236cff0bec7a09987", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 49], "journal": [50, 57], "publication_year": [59, 63], "title": [74, 187], "keywords": [201, 225], "abstract": [238, 1386], "body": [1395, 40676]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32934326, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-72228-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493939", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7493939"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493939\">7493939</a>", "list_title": "PMC7493939  Information content best characterises the hemispheric selectivity of the inferior parietal lobe: a meta-analysis"}

The underlying neural mechanisms of this speech perception difficulty are unclear. In typically developed individuals, three cerebral cortex regions are particularly related to speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception: the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the right insula, and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Here, we tested whether responses in these cerebral cortex regions are altered in speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception in autism. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nSeventeen autistic adults and 17 typically developed controls (matched pairwise on age, sex, and IQ) performed an auditory\u2010only speech recognition task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Speech was presented either with noise (noise condition) or without noise (no noise condition, i.e., clear speech). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn the left IFG, blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) responses were higher in the control compared to the autism group for recognizing speech\u2010in\u2010noise compared to clear speech. For this contrast, both groups had similar response magnitudes in the right insula and left IPL. Additionally, we replicated previous findings that BOLD responses in speech\u2010related and auditory brain regions (including bilateral superior temporal sulcus and Heschl's gyrus) for clear speech were similar in both groups and that voice identity recognition was impaired for clear and noisy speech in autism. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur findings show that in autism, the processing of speech is particularly reduced under noisy conditions in the left IFG\u2014a dysfunction that might be important in explaining restricted speech comprehension in noisy environments. \n\n  \nRecognizing what another person is saying in a noisy environment (i.e., speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition) is an everyday challenging task, especially for people with autism. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the left inferior frontal gyrus among a set of meta\u2010analytically delineated areas is altered in autism for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition. Our finding is specific for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition since cerebral cortex response for clear speech was on a neurotypical level in the autism group.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nRecognizing speech in a noisy environment (speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition), such as on a crowded street or in a busy canteen, is an everyday challenging task. Background noise significantly diminishes speech recognition success in normal hearing individuals (e.g., Ross et\u00a0al.,  ; Sumby & Pollack,  ) and can impede communication and cognitive performance (for reviews see Klatte et\u00a0al.,  ; Picard & Bradley,  ; Szalma & Hancock,  ; van der Kruk et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nSpeech\u2010in\u2010noise perception is often altered or impaired in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition characterized by difficulties in social communication (Alcantara et\u00a0al.,  ; American Psychiatric Association,  ; Foxe et\u00a0al.,  ; Groen et\u00a0al.,  ; Irwin et\u00a0al.,  ; Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ; Smith & Bennetto,  ). The objectively measured speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception difficulties are also featured in subjective reports of people with ASD (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ; Schreiter,  ). In contrast, speech recognition abilities under low noise or no noise conditions (i.e., clear speech) are intact in ASD (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n\nOnly a few studies investigated the neural processing of speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception in ASD (Hernandez et\u00a0al.,  ; Lin et\u00a0al.,  ; Russo et\u00a0al.,  ; Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ). These studies focused on alteration and reduction of responses in subcortical sensory structures (Russo et\u00a0al.,  ; Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ) and/or did not include a speech recognition task (Hernandez et\u00a0al.,  ; Lin et\u00a0al.,  ; Russo et\u00a0al.,  ). Russo et\u00a0al. ( ) found altered brainstem responses in children with ASD as compared to typically developing children when passively listening to speech (i.e., syllables). These alterations were present both for speech without noise as well as when speech was presented with additional white noise. Schelinski et\u00a0al. ( ) showed enhanced responses within a typically developed control group, when performing a speech recognition task when the speech signal was presented with noise versus no noise in the left and right inferior colliculus (IC). The IC is a nucleus of the subcortical auditory pathway associated with processing of spectro\u2010temporal voice acoustic features (e.g., Baumann et\u00a0al.,  ; Griffiths et\u00a0al.,  ; for review see Pannese et\u00a0al.,  ). In the ASD group, this was only the case in the left, but not the right IC (but there was no interaction between noise and group). Whether such response alterations for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition are confined to the subcortical sensory pathway or are present also in the cerebral cortex are to\u2010date unknown. \n\nIn a recent meta\u2010analysis, three cerebral cortex areas have been identified that are particularly involved in recognizing speech\u2010in\u2010noise in typically developed individuals: left inferior frontal gyrus (left IFG), right insula, and left inferior parietal lobule (left IPL) (Alain et\u00a0al.,  ). Our first aim was to investigate the hypothesis that speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception in ASD is associated with reduced responses of one or several of these three regions. \n\nPrevious studies showed that on the behavioral level, speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition abilities can be impaired in ASD (Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ) but that performance in tests on speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition can be variable depending on the experimental design (Alcantara et\u00a0al.,  ). Besides speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition difficulties, there is evidence that voice identity recognition is impaired in ASD (Boucher et\u00a0al.,  ; Klin,  ; Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ). For example, we showed in previous studies that voice identity recognition is impaired in ASD (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ,  ) and that this contrasted intact speech recognition performance in conditions without noise (i.e., clear speech). A second aim of the present study was to replicate these previous behavioral findings on speech and voice identity recognition and to investigate on how far group differences in voice identity recognition performance are affected by noise. \n\nSeventeen adults with ASD and 17 typically developed adults (matched pairwise on age, sex, IQ, and handedness), participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on auditory speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition (speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment). During the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment, participants performed speech recognition tasks on speech that was either presented with noise (noise condition) or without noise (no noise condition). We hypothesized to find reduced brain responses for speech recognition in noisy conditions in contrast to the no noise condition in the ASD group as compared to typically developed controls (a noise x group interaction) in one or more of the three regions of interest (left IFG, right insula, left IPL). The design also permitted to test for replication of comparable cerebral responses for ASD and controls for clear speech (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ; Tryfon et\u00a0al.,  ). For the no noise condition (i.e., clear speech), we did expect to find comparable brain responses in speech\u2010related brain areas (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ; Tryfon et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nSpeakers who were presented during the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment were familiarized to the participants during a speaker familiarization before the fMRI. Thus, besides testing behavioral speech recognition abilities, the design also allowed to investigate behavioral performance in voice identity recognition. To formally test this, we additionally included a voice identity recognition experiment that includes the speakers presented during the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment. In the voice identity recognition experiment, we tested voice identity recognition abilities when the voice signal was presented with and without additional noise (noise condition/no noise condition). Based on previous findings (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ), we hypothesized that in the no noise condition the ASD group would show significantly lower performance as compared to the control group for voice identity but not for speech recognition. For the noise conditions, we expected that the group differences (i.e., lower performance for the ASD as compared to the control group) would be particularly pronounced for voice identity recognition. Based on previous findings, we also expected that the ASD group would perform worse as compared to the control group in speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition (Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ). However, speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition abilities have also been found to be variable in ASD depending on the experimental design (Alcantara et\u00a0al.,  ; Groen et\u00a0al.,  ), indicating that speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition performance could also be comparable between the ASD and the control group. \n\nInvestigating the neural processing of speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception in ASD is important, because it contributes to a better understanding of basic mechanisms related to communication difficulties in ASD. Further, investigating speech\u2010in\u2010noise processing in a clinical population fosters our understanding of speech perception in challenging conditions not only in atypical, but also in typically developed individuals. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventeen adults with ASD participated in the ASD group and 17 typically developed (TD) adults participated in the TD group. The groups in each experiment were matched pairwise. Each TD group participant was matched to one participant in the ASD group with respect to gender (male or female), chronological age (age difference within each participant pair \u2264 3\u00a0years), handedness (right or left as assessed by a standard questionnaire; Oldfield,  ), and intelligence quotient (IQ; Table\u00a0 ; full\u2010scale IQ difference within each participant pair was maximally one standard deviation [15 IQ points]). IQ was assessed using the German adapted version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS\u2010III; Wechsler,  ; German version by von Aster,  ). All participants had an IQ within the normal range or above (IQ\u00a0>\u00a085), indicating that all participants were on a \u201chigh\u2010functioning\u201d cognitive level. Additionally, groups showed comparable concentration performances (d2 test of attention; Brickenkamp,  ) (Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nDescriptive data for the ASD and the control group and group comparisons \n    \nAll participants were native German speakers. They reported normal hearing abilities and no limitations or disorders associated with the ear or hearing. Normal hearing abilities were confirmed with pure tone audiometry (hearing level equal or above 25\u00a0dB at the frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000\u00a0Hz tested in each ear separately). \n\nAll participants were free of psychotropic or any other medication at the time of testing. One TD group participant took a histamine antagonist for allergies when needed. One ASD group participant took antihypertensive medication and two ASD group participants took thyroid medication. None of the participants in the TD or ASD group reported to have a neurological disease. \n\nWe recruited people with ASD via autism outpatient clinics and announcements in communities for people with ASD, that is, self\u2010help groups and online fora. We attempted to maximize the number of clinical participants we could recruit in a given time (approximately 1 year). All ASD group participants had previously received a formal clinical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (12 male, 3 female) or childhood autism (2 male, Verbal\u2010IQ 100 and 119) according to the diagnostic criteria of the International and Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD\u201010; World Health Organization,  ). We only included participants into the ASD group who could provide a clinical diagnosis. That means that independent clinical experts made the diagnoses of all ASD participants before participating in the study. Additionally, the performance of all participants in the ASD group (except for one participant) was assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; Lord et\u00a0al.,  ; German version by R\u00fchl et\u00a0al.,  ). ADOS data were not available for one participant. If caregivers were available (  n  \u00a0=\u00a011), we additionally conducted the Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2010Revised (ADI\u2010R; Lord, Rutter & Le Couteur,  ; German version by B\u00f6lte et\u00a0al.,  ) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter et\u00a0al.,  ; German version by B\u00f6lte & Poustka,  ) (Table  ). \n\nWe recruited the TD group participants from the participant database of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. The database contains participants who have contacted the institute because they are interested in taking part in scientific studies. The database contains volunteers with, for example, different age ranges and different socioeconomic status or educational backgrounds. Participants in the TD group reported to have no neurological or psychiatric history and no family history of ASD. None of the TD group participants exhibited a clinically relevant number of traits associated with ASD as assessed by the autism spectrum quotient (AQ; Baron\u2010Cohen et\u00a0al.,  ; German version adapted from Freitag, 2010; Freitag et\u00a0al.,  ; Table\u00a0 ). \n\nAll participants received payment for their participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at the University Leipzig, Germany (299\u201012\u201014092012). All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with procedures approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Leipzig. \n\n\n### Experiments \n  \nTo investigate neural responses to speech\u2010in\u2010noise, participants performed an auditory\u2010only speech recognition task for speech that was either presented with or without additional noise during MRI (speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment, Figure\u00a0 ). Design and raw data for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment are the same as described in Schelinski et\u00a0al. ( ). For participants who never had MRI before, we conducted a mock MRI to familiarize the participants with the MRI environment. Before the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment, participants were familiarized with the voices of the speakers presented in the experiment (speaker familiarization and voice identity recognition task; Figure\u00a0 ) and the task (task familiarization). We used Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., USA) to present stimuli and record responses. We presented stimuli during the fMRI experiments using an MR confon system (Mark II; MR confon, Germany). Participants wore ear plugs in addition to MRI\u2010compatible headphones. All stimuli in the familiarization phases (i.e., speaker and task familiarization) and the voice identity recognition experiment were presented on a laptop outside the MRI\u2010scanner room via headphones (HD 201, Sennheiser, Germany) and were not used during the fMRI experiments. Initial sound levels were the default values of the MR confon system, similar for all participants and adjusted to a comfortable hearing level if needed. \n  \nExperimental design and example trials for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment (a,b) and the voice identity recognition experiment (c). In both experiments, stimuli consisted of blocks of auditory sentences presented with or without background noise (noise/no noise condition). Each condition was presented in separate blocks. (a) During the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment, fMRI volumes were acquired continuously. (b) Example trials for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment. Participants heard a sentence over headphones followed by a written word on the screen. Participants decided whether they had heard the word presented on the screen in the previously presented sentence or not. (c) The voice identity recognition experiment had the same design as the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment. Participants listened to sentences spoken by the speakers from the speech\u2010in\u2010noise experiment and decided whether the written name (presented on the computer screen) matched the name of the speaker of the previously presented sentence or not. \n  \n#### Speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment \n  \n##### Stimuli \n  \nStimuli consisted of auditory\u2010only five\u2010word sentences spoken by six male native German speakers of similar age (age range 25\u201331 years old). The sentences were semantically neutral, phonologically and syntactically homogeneous (e.g., \u201cDer Junge tr\u00e4gt einen Koffer\u201d [\u201cThe boy carries a suitcase\u201d] or \u201cDer Koch schneidet das Gem\u00fcse\u201d [\u201cThe cook cuts the vegetables\u201d]) and spoken in a neutral manner. All speakers were unfamiliar to all participants. The final stimulus set included 90 sentences for each speaker (45 stimuli without and 45 stimuli combined with noise). We generated auditory stimuli from audio\u2010visual recordings which were made from each speaker using a digital video camera (HD\u2010Camcorder LEGRIA HSF100; Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with an external directional microphone (Sennheiser Kondensator M. System K6; Sennheiser, Wedemark, German; 44100\u00a0kHz sampling rate, 16\u2010bit resolution). The raw audio material was preselected using Audacity software (version 1.3.5 beta,  ). For further processing of the audio material, we used Matlab software (version 8.2, The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). All audio stimuli were cut to have 50\u00a0ms of silence at onset and 150\u00a0ms of silence at offset. The audio stimuli from all six speakers were adjusted to the same root mean square (rms\u00a0=\u00a00.0765). To create an additional set of stimuli for the noise condition, the same audio stimuli were combined with pink noise (signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio of \u22128\u00a0dB; linear 10\u00a0ms fade\u2010in and fade\u2010out). \n\n\n##### Experimental design \n  \nBefore the fMRI experiment, the participants were familiarized with the speakers and the task. For a detailed description, see Supporting Information. During the fMRI, participants performed speech recognition tasks on speech that was presented with additional noise (noise condition) or without (no noise condition) (Figure\u00a0 ). Each condition was presented in 18 blocks so that the experiment had 36 blocks in total. In each block, nine sentences were spoken by three of the previously familiarized six speakers (see Section \"Stimuli\"; 324 trials in total). At the end of each sentence, a written word (target word) appeared on the screen and the participants had to decide whether this word appeared within the sentence or not (Figure\u00a0 ). The written word was presented for 1\u00a0s. To avoid training effects for the sentences, different sentences were presented during the noise and the no noise condition. Whether a sentence was presented with or without noise was counterbalanced across subjects. All sentences were repeated for a maximum of two times within one condition. If sentences were repeated within one condition, they were spoken by a different speaker. Between blocks, there was a silent period of 18\u00a0s in which we presented a fixation cross on the screen (Figure\u00a0 ). Including the silence period, the duration of one block was approximately 45\u00a0s. Sentences within each block were presented randomly ordered. The order of blocks was presented randomly for each participant, but was the same for each matched pair of ASD and TD group participants. Responses were made via a button box using the target and the middle finger of the dominant hand. Total MRI acquisition time was approximately 27\u00a0min. \n\n\n\n#### Voice identity recognition experiment \n  \nTo test voice identity recognition abilities, the participants performed a voice identity recognition task for speakers learned during the speaker familiarization phase. \n\n##### Stimuli \n  \nStimuli of the voice identity recognition experiment consisted of an additional set of auditory\u2010only five\u2010word sentences spoken by the same six speakers as described for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment (18 sentences per speaker). All sentences were semantically neutral, phonologically and syntactically homogeneous five\u2010word questions (e.g., \u201c\u00dcberquert der Igel die Stra\u00dfe?\u201d [\u201cIs the hedgehog crossing the street?\u201d]) or (e.g., \u201cVerliert die Pflanze ihre Bl\u00e4tter?\u201d [\u201cIs the plant losing its leaves?\u201d]). Stimuli were recorded and processed as described for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment. \n\n\n##### Experimental design \n  \nThe participants performed voice identity recognition tasks on speech that was presented with additional noise (noise condition) or without (no noise condition) (Figure\u00a0 ). Each condition was presented in 6 blocks (12 blocks in total). Each block contained 9 trials (108 trials in total). Each speaker was presented 18 times (nine trials in the noise and nine trials in the no noise condition). Sentences were different for the noise and the no noise condition. In each trial, one sentence spoken by one of the six speakers was presented. At the end of the sentence, a written name of one of the six speakers appeared on the screen. Participants were instructed to decide after each sentence, whether the sentence was spoken by the person or not. Before the start of the actual voice identity recognition experiment, participants were familiarized with the noise signal (i.e., 3\u00a0s presentation of the pure noise signal) and performed an example block which included one sentence per speaker. \n\n\n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nStructural T1\u2010weighted and functional images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Verio scanner (Siemens, Germany) with a 32\u2010channel head coil for the structural and a 12\u2010channel head coil for the functional images. \n\n#### Functional MRI \n  \nVolumes were acquired continuously (TR\u00a0=\u00a02.81 s; 581 volumes for each participant). fMRI images were acquired using a gradient\u2010echo EPI (echo planar imaging) pulse sequence (TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0; FoV\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0mm \u00d7 192\u00a0mm; 2\u00a0mm slice thickness; interslice gap\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm resulting in a resolution of 3\u00a0mm isotropic; 42 axial slices; acquisition bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a01954\u00a0Hz; whole brain coverage; ascending acquisition). A pair of 2D gradient echo images with different echo times (TE1/TE2\u00a0=\u00a04.92\u00a0ms/7.38\u00a0ms) was obtained for B0 field mapping (Jezzard & Balaban,  ). These images were measured at the same slice locations as in the fMRI acquisition. Voxel resolution and image size were the same. Scanning parameters were: TR\u00a0=\u00a0488\u00a0ms, flip angle 60\u00b0, pixel bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a0327\u00a0Hz/pixel. Images were acquired AC\u2010PC oriented. \n\n\n#### Structural MRI \n  \nAnatomical images were acquired using a 32\u2010channel head coil and a T1\u2010weighted 3D magnetization\u2010prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (Mugler & Brookeman,  ) (TR\u00a0=\u00a02300\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a02.98\u00a0ms; TI\u00a0=\u00a0900\u00a0ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0; FOV\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0mm \u00d7 240\u00a0mm; voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01 mm  [isotropic resolution]; 176 sagittal slices) with nonselective excitation and linear phase encoding. Magnetization preparation consisted of a nonselective inversion pulse. For one participant, we used a 12\u2010channel head coil (with an identical scanning protocol), as the 32\u2010channel head coil was too tight for the participants' head size. Scanning time for the structural scan was 9\u00a0min 14 s. \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nIf not otherwise stated, all analyses included data from 17 participants with ASD and their respective matched TD group participants. Data from one ASD participant were not available for the voice identity recognition task due to technical reasons. To ensure pairwise comparison, we also excluded the data from the matched TD\u2010group participant for the voice identity recognition experiment (i.e.,   n  \u00a0=\u00a016 for both groups). \n\n#### Behavioral data \n  \nFor analyzing behavioral data, we used SPSS software (version 24, IBM SPSS Statistics, NY, USA). We used R (RCoreTeam,  ) for creating figures. As dependent variables, we used the average percentage and reaction times of correct and incorrect responses. For recognition accuracy, we treated missed responses as incorrect responses. For group comparisons, we used analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and independent   t  \u2010tests. We used paired samples   t  \u2010tests for within\u2010group comparisons. All statistical tests were calculated two tailed. The level of significance was defined at   \u03b1  \u00a0=\u00a0.05. \n\n\n#### MRI data \n  \nWe analyzed MRI data using standard procedures in SPM software (version 12, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, London, UK) in a Matlab environment (version 9.3, The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). For pre\u2010processing, images were realigned and unwrapped. Anatomical scans were co\u2010registered to the mean of the functional scans. Images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard stereotactic space and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4\u00a0mm full width at half maximum. For all analyses, statistical parametric maps were generated by modeling the evoked hemodynamic response for the different conditions as boxcar functions convolved with a synthetic hemodynamic response function using the general linear model (Friston et\u00a0al.,  ) (high\u2010pass filter 128 s). We modeled the conditions \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cno noise\u201d at the first level. To account for differences in task difficulty, we included the individual differences in task performance (percent correct) between the noise and the no noise condition as covariate of no interest for within and between group task comparisons. We performed one\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests across the single\u2010subject contrast images for within group analyses. For between group analyses, we used two\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests comparing the means of the single\u2010subject contrast images from both groups. \n\n##### Regions of interest \n  \nWe focused on brain regions that have been identified to play a role in speech\u2010in\u2010noise processing in a meta\u2010analysis of neuroimaging studies (Alain et\u00a0al.,  ) (Figure  ). These regions are the left IFG, the right insula, and the left IPL. For the region of interest (ROI) analysis, we created spheres with a radius of 5\u00a0mm surrounding the peak coordinates provided for each of these regions in the meta\u2010analysis (Talairach coordinates: left IFG:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221236,   y  \u00a0=\u00a019,   z  \u00a0=\u00a08 [MNI space:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221237,   y  \u00a0=\u00a022,   z  \u00a0=\u00a06]; right insula:   x  \u00a0=\u00a031,   y  \u00a0=\u00a018,   z  \u00a0=\u00a012 [MNI space:   x  \u00a0=\u00a032,   y  \u00a0=\u00a020,   z  \u00a0=\u00a010]; left IPL:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221235,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221250,   z  \u00a0=\u00a036 [MNI space:   x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221235,   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221253,   z  \u00a0=\u00a038]). Transformation from Talairach space into MNI space is based on a nonlinear registration between the Talairach and the MNI brain (Lacadie et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n##### Significance thresholds for fMRI data \n  \nWe considered effects as significant at   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 family wise error corrected (FWE at peak level) for the ROI and Bonferroni corrected for the three ROIs (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.016 FWE corrected). We considered effects for which we did not have an a priori hypothesis as significant at   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 FWE corrected for the whole brain. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \n#### Speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment \n  \n##### Recognition accuracy \n  \nFor recognition accuracy, a repeated\u2010measures ANOVA with the between\u2010subject factor \u201cgroup\u201d (TD, ASD) and the within\u2010subject factor \u201cnoise condition\u201d (no noise, noise) revealed no significant main effect of group and no significant interaction between the factors task and group (  p  s\u00a0>\u00a0.2). There was a significant main effect of noise condition (  F  (1,32)\u00a0=\u00a0333.668,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.912) (  n  \u00a0=\u00a017 for the ASD and the control group) (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). A post hoc paired   t  \u2010test indicated that over all participants, performance was lower in the noise as compared to the no noise condition (  t  (33)\u00a0=\u00a018.493,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001,   d  \u00a0=\u00a03.172) (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nPerformance accuracy in the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition and the voice identity recognition experiment. (a) In the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment, there were no significant differences between the ASD and the control group. Both groups performed significantly worse in the noise condition as compared to the no noise speech task condition. (b) In the voice identity recognition experiment, the ASD group performed significantly worse as compared to the control group in the noise and the no noise condition. Both groups performed significantly worse in the noise as compared to the no noise condition. Bars represent the mean average accuracy score for each group. Dots represent mean performances from each participant. Beans represent the smoothed density curve showing the full data distribution. Bands represent the 95% confidence interval around the mean. *   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; **   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005; n.s., not significant. \n    \nSummary of average recognition accuracy (in % correct) and reaction times (RT in ms) for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition and the voice identity recognition experiment \n    \n\n##### Reaction times \n  \nFor reaction times, a repeated\u2010measures ANOVA with the between\u2010subject factor \u201cgroup\u201d (TD, ASD) and the within\u2010subject factor \u201cnoise condition\u201d (no noise, noise) revealed no significant main effect of group and no interaction between the factors task and group (  p  s\u00a0>\u00a0.8). This indicates that the control and the ASD group showed similar reaction times for the task and both conditions. There was a significant main effect of noise condition (  F  (1,32)\u00a0=\u00a04.926,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.034,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.133) (Table\u00a0 ). A post hoc paired   t  \u2010test indicated that over all participants, reaction times were higher in the noise as compared to the no noise condition (  t  (33)\u00a0=\u00a02.254,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.031,   d  \u00a0=\u00a00.386). \n\n\n\n#### Voice identity recognition experiment \n  \n##### Recognition accuracy \n  \nThe ASD group (  n  \u00a0=\u00a016) showed significantly lower performance in voice identity recognition as compared to the control group (  n  \u00a0=\u00a016) when the voice was presented with noise as well as when the speech signal was presented without noise (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). This was revealed by a repeated\u2010measures ANOVA with the between\u2010subjects factor \u201cgroup\u201d (TD, ASD) and the within\u2010subject factor \u201cnoise condition\u201d (no noise, noise) and post hoc   t  \u2010tests. There were significant main effects of group (  F  (1,30)\u00a0=\u00a014.024,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.319) and noise condition (  F  (1,30)\u00a0=\u00a034.5444,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.535). There was no significant interaction between the group x noise condition (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.372). Post hoc   t  \u2010tests indicate that the ASD group performed significantly worse in voice identity recognition as compared to the control group in both noise conditions (independent   t  \u2010tests: no noise:   t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a03.615,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001,   d  \u00a0=\u00a01.078; noise:   t  (30)\u00a0=\u00a03.047,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.005,   d  \u00a0=\u00a01.324) (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ) and that over all participants, performance was significantly worse in the noise as compared to the no noise condition (paired   t  \u2010test:   t  (31)\u00a0=\u00a05.894,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001,   d  \u00a0=\u00a01.042). \n\n\n##### Reaction times \n  \nA repeated\u2010measures ANOVA with the between\u2010subjects factor \u201cgroup\u201d (TD, ASD) and the within\u2010subject factor \u201cnoise condition\u201d (no noise, noise) for reaction times revealed a significant interaction (  F  (1,29)\u00a0=\u00a011.499,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.002,   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.284). Post hoc   t  \u2010tests indicate that this interaction was driven by lower reaction times (i.e., faster responses) in the noise as compared to the no noise condition in the ASD group (paired   t  \u2010test:   t  (15)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.283,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.005,   d  \u00a0=\u00a02,207) (Table\u00a0 ). This result was unexpected. There were no significant main effects of group (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.507) or noise condition (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.201). These results indicate that the control and the ASD group had similar reaction times for voice identity recognition and for both noise conditions. \n\n\n\n\n### fMRI\u2014speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition experiment \n  \n#### ROI analysis \n  \nThe TD group (  n  \u00a0=\u00a017) and the ASD group (  n  \u00a0=\u00a017) showed significantly higher blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) responses in the left IFG when performing the noise as compared to the no noise task condition (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). There was an interaction between noise condition and group, indicating that responses in the left IFG for the contrast \u201cnoise\u00a0>\u00a0no noise\u201d were significantly higher in the TD group as compared to the ASD group (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.010 FWE corrected and Bonferroni corrected for the three ROIs) (Figure\u00a0 ). For the same contrast (i.e., \u201cnoise\u00a0>\u00a0no noise\u201d), there were no significantly higher responses in the right insula or the left IPL within or between the groups. Both groups had significant BOLD responses in the left IFG and the right insula for the main effects noise and no noise and there were no significant group differences for these responses (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). For the same main effects (i.e., \u201cnoise,\u201d \u201cno noise\u201d), there were enhanced responses in the left IPL within the TD group. For the left IPL, there was also a detectable enhanced response for the noise condition in the ASD group; however, this response did not survive the Bonferroni\u2010correction for the three ROIs (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.016 FWE corrected). Responses in the left IPL were not significantly different between the TD and the ASD group for the noise or no noise main effect. \n  \nfMRI results for the ROI analyses for the left IFG. (a) The left IFG showed enhanced response for the noise as compared to the no noise condition in both groups. This enhanced response in the left IFG for the contrast noise\u00a0>\u00a0no noise was significantly higher in the control group as compared to the ASD group. Results are significant at   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 FWE corrected and Bonferroni corrected for 3 ROIs (i.e., left IFG, right insula, and left IPL). For display purposes only, within group results are displayed at   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.005 uncorrected and the interaction (TD\u00a0>\u00a0ASD for noise\u00a0>\u00a0no noise) at   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 uncorrected.

Here, we replicated this finding: For the clear speech condition (i.e., main effect no noise), both the TD and the ASD group showed very similar responses (Figure\u00a0 ). For a full list of regions, see Table  . There were no significant differences between the two groups in any brain region for the clear speech condition (  p  \u00a0>\u00a00.05 FWE corrected for the whole brain). For information purposes only, we additionally report whole brain results for the clear speech and the noise condition at a lenient level of significance (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 uncorrected; Tables   and  ). \n  \nWhole brain fMRI responses to clear speech (i.e., speech task no noise condition). The TD and the ASD group showed similar responses in speech\u2010associated areas including bilateral Heschl's gyrus and STS/G (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 FWE corrected for whole brain). Results are visualized at   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.05 FWE corrected and for information purposes only additionally at   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001 uncorrected. At this lenient threshold, there are clusters in the medial temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and the frontal pole, with a volume of\u00a0<\u00a05 voxels.

First, for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition as compared to speech recognition without noise (clear speech), the left IFG responded less in the ASD group as compared to the control group. Second, the ASD group showed typical cerebral cortex responses when processing clear speech. Third, replicating our previous behavioral findings, for clear speech, the ASD group performed worse as compared to the control group in voice identity recognition, whereas both groups performed comparable in speech recognition. The ASD group also had lower recognition accuracy for identity recognition when the voice signal was presented with noise. Unexpectedly, there were no significant group differences for performance in the speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition task. \n\nWe provide novel evidence that processes related to speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition in ASD are particularly altered in the left IFG. Only a few studies investigated the neural processing of speech\u2010in\u2010noise in ASD (Hernandez et\u00a0al.,  ; Lin et\u00a0al.,  ; Russo et\u00a0al.,  ; Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ). Russo et\u00a0al. ( ) found altered brainstem responses in children with ASD as compared to typically developing children when passively listening to speech (i.e., syllables) when the speech signal was presented with and without additional noise (i.e., presented together with white noise). In a recent study, Hernandez et\u00a0al. ( ) showed increased cerebral cortex responses in adolescents with ASD as compared to typically developing controls when passively listening to a conversation of two people when the conversation was presented with as compared to when the conversation was presented without additional noise (i.e., noises from everyday life, such as a police siren). This increased response in the left angular gyrus was interpreted as compensatory. The left angular gyrus is part of the left IPL (Igelstrom & Graziano,  ) and has been found to play a causal role in facilitating speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition (Hartwigsen et\u00a0al.,  ). In our study, we did not find such enhanced response in another part of the left IPL, neither within the control nor within the ASD group. Contrasting the results from Hernandez et\u00a0al. ( ), Lin et\u00a0al. ( ) found evidence for reduced cortical connectivity between the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the left dorsal premotor cortex in adults with ASD as compared to controls when participants were asked to attentively listen to (i.e., indicate if a sentence was intelligible or not) spectrally degraded speech (i.e., noise vocoded speech) as compared to when listening to clear speech and spectrally rotated unintelligible speech. The TPJ is a brain area that overlaps with the IPL at the intersection of the angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and the posterior superior temporal lobe (Igelstrom & Graziano,  ). In these previous studies, participants passively listened to the auditory stimuli (Hernandez et\u00a0al.,  ; Russo et\u00a0al.,  ) or attention was attempted to be increased by an intelligibility task (Lin et\u00a0al.,  ). However, since all these three studies did not include an explicit task to recognize speech, they cannot address brain responses when recognizing speech\u2010in\u2010noise. This point is critical, because differences in task instruction in speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception lead to the recruitment of different brain mechanism (Wild et\u00a0al.,  ). Evidence that neural processing is altered when performing a speech recognition task comes from a previous study which included the same ASD and TD group participants as reported here (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ). In that study, the TD group but not the ASD group showed enhanced responses in the right IC for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition as compared to speech recognition without noise. However, IC\u2010responses were not significantly different between the two groups (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ). Here, we provide evidence that the cerebral cortex processing of speech\u2010in\u2010noise is altered in adult ASD as compared to typically developed adults. Our study rests on a sample (  n  \u00a0=\u00a034) that is relatively homogeneous (i.e., adults with an IQ and verbal abilities at least within the normal range). This means that we do not know whether similar alterations as found in the present study can also be found in larger and more heterogeneous samples representing the whole autism spectrum. \n\nOur findings suggest that in ASD, the recognition of speech under noisy listening conditions is particularly reduced in the left IFG. The peak coordinate for the left IFG found in the meta\u2010analyses by Alain et\u00a0al. (  x  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221237,   y  \u00a0=\u00a022,   z  \u00a0=\u00a06) for speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition is in close proximity to the left insula (compare, e.g., Smith et\u00a0al.,  ). A number of previous studies showed that the left IFG and insula are involved in challenging listening conditions (e.g., Davis et\u00a0al.,  ; Davis & Johnsrude,  ; Giraud et\u00a0al.,  ; Golestani et\u00a0al.,  ; Obleser et\u00a0al.,  ). Comparing brain responsiveness to different levels of distortion of the speech signal, the greatest involvement of the left IFG was observed when the speech signal was more difficult to understand but still intelligible as compared to when the speech signal was clear speech or unintelligible due to distortion (Davis et\u00a0al.,  ; Davis & Johnsrude,  ; Du et\u00a0al.,  ; Golestani et\u00a0al.,  ; Peelle et\u00a0al.,  ). This fits well with our results where both groups performed significantly worse in the speech\u2010in\u2010noise condition as compared to the no noise condition but the speech signal was still intelligible as indicated by performance well above chance in both groups for the speech\u2010in\u2010noise condition (i.e., correct responses of about 70% in the control group and 68% in the ASD group). \n\nThe left IFG and adjacent areas (including the left insula) are integral parts of both the speech perception as well as the speech production network (Friederici,  ; Hickok & Poeppel,  ; Price,  ). One line of research highlights the supportive role of sensorimotor brain regions (including the left IFG and insula) for speech perception (e.g., Davis & Johnsrude,  ; Hickok et\u00a0al.,  ; Iacoboni,  ; Pulvermuller et\u00a0al.,  ; Rauschecker & Scott,  ; Wilson et\u00a0al.,  ). Recent studies in typically developed adults suggest that such a supportive role of motoric brain regions, including the left IFG and adjacent areas (i.e., insula), is particularly important in speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception (Adank et\u00a0al.,  ; Binder et\u00a0al.,  ; Du et\u00a0al.,  ; Hervais\u2010Adelman et\u00a0al.,  ; Shahin et\u00a0al.,  ; Wild et\u00a0al.,  ; Zekveld et\u00a0al.,  ). For example, in a previous study, enhanced responses in the left IFG/insula were associated with the recognition of noise vocoded single words (Hervais\u2010Adelman et\u00a0al.,  ). In another study, activity of the left IFG increased with decreasing SNRs, indicating higher responses of the left IFG when the speech signal (i.e., syllables added with white noise) was more difficult to understand (Binder et\u00a0al.,  ). A similar mechanism is assumed for the supportive role of sensory\u2010motor regions when comprehending speech\u2010in\u2010noise across studies: The incoming speech input is compared against articulatory representations or templates (hold in the sensory\u2010motor system) and is simulated via these sensory\u2010motor regions which helps to predict what is said and thus facilitates speech comprehension (Binder et\u00a0al.,  ; Du et\u00a0al.,  ; Hervais\u2010Adelman et\u00a0al.,  ; Shahin et\u00a0al.,  ; Zekveld et\u00a0al.,  ). This mechanism might be particularly important when speech is more unpredictable, which requires more error correction (Du et\u00a0al.,  ). In a predictive coding view, such a mechanism would assume that we have a generative model of the speaker's speech signal (von Kriegstein et\u00a0al.,  ). By simulating the articulatory movements of a speaker, we can better predict what the speaker is saying, particularly in noisy listening conditions. We suggest that differences in this mechanism can explain group differences in the left IFG/insula. More specifically, we assume that enhanced activity in the left IFG/insula in response to speech\u2010in\u2010noise as compared to clear speech in the control group could be explained by a facilitative effect of sensory\u2010motor representations which simulate the incoming speech input. In contrast, for the ASD group, we suggest that this mechanism is less pronounced and which leads to a less pronounced facilitation of speech perception in challenging listening conditions. \n\nThe IFG has been associated with further top\u2010down functions which may be supportive of recognizing speech in challenging listening conditions, such as attention (Wild et\u00a0al.,  ), verbal working memory (e.g., Du et\u00a0al.,  ; Zekveld et\u00a0al.,  ), and semantic and syntactic integration (e.g., Davis et\u00a0al.,  ). In line with findings by Wild et\u00a0al. ( ), group differences in our study could also be explained by a top\u2010down effect of attention. Wild et\u00a0al. ( ) found enhanced left IFG responses for attended degraded speech (i.e., noise\u2010vocoded sentences) as compared to ignored speech or clear speech. In this sense, the processing of degraded speech could be also enhanced by attention and engaging higher\u2010order mechanisms that modulate early perceptual processing, a mechanism which could be more pronounced in the TD as compared to the ASD group. We assume that our results are unlikely to be explainable by group differences in verbal working memory, because both groups were matched on verbal working memory and did also not differ in verbal\u2010IQ (Table\u00a0 ). We further assume that group differences in the left IFG were not primarily due to differences in semantic or syntactic processing, since sentences in both task conditions (noise and no noise) had the same structure and were syntactically homogenous and semantically neutral. Additionally, whether specific sentences of the stimulus set were presented with or without noise was counterbalanced over participants, but the same for each TD\u2010ASD pair. Further, our results are unlikely to be explained by behavioral group differences, since there were no significant group differences for the no noise or the noise condition. \n\nThe ASD group showed typical neural processing for clear speech in brain areas associated with clear speech processing, including bilateral Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/G) (Friederici,  ). This is in line with recent results from a meta\u2010analysis on speech perception in ASD which showed mostly similar cerebral cortex responses when processing clear speech in ASD and typically developed individuals including bilateral STS/G and left IFG (Tryfon et\u00a0al.,  ). Further, our results replicate previous study findings in which we showed that the neural processing of clear speech recognition is on a neurotypical level in adults with high\u2010functioning ASD (Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ). In that study, we found that the neural responses to speech were not significantly different between groups of people with ASD and typically developed controls when performing a speech recognition task as compared to when performing a voice identity recognition task. \n\nThe level of speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition abilities in ASD varied between previous studies, likely due to differences in the experimental design (Alcantara et\u00a0al.,  ; Foxe et\u00a0al.,  ; Groen et\u00a0al.,  ; Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ). Though we found group differences in the cerebral cortex for speech\u2010in\u2010noise processing, we did not find group differences at the behavioral level. In a previous study, we used an adaptive tracking procedure to detect individual thresholds in speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition and found significant group differences with an even higher noise level of SNR of \u22128 (Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ). In that study, adults with ASD had higher speech reception thresholds (SRTs) (mean \u22127.59\u00a0dB SNR) as compared to typically developed control group participants (mean \u22129.04\u00a0dB SNR) for speech (i.e., two\u2010word sentences) that was presented in speech\u2010shaped\u2010noise. Lower thresholds in the control group indicated better speech recognition performance in higher levels of noise. A comparable speech\u2010in\u2010noise recognition performance for ASD and control group participants as observed in the present study is in line with previous studies in which both groups showed similar SRTs for speech that was presented in continuous background noise (Alcantara et\u00a0al.,  ; Groen et\u00a0al.,  ). Alcantara et\u00a0al. ( ) found comparable SRTs between a group of adolescents and young adults with ASD when the speech stimuli (i.e., sentences including key words) were presented together with speech\u2010shaped noise. Similarly, Groen et\u00a0al. ( ) found comparable SRTs between a group of children and adolescents with ASD and control group participants when the speech stimuli (i.e., single words) were presented together with pink noise. We assume that the difference between results can most likely be explained by the thresholds chosen for correct speech recognition performance. Alcantara et\u00a0al. ( ) and Groen et\u00a0al. ( ) used a threshold of 50% correct speech recognition performance to determine SRTs in an adaptive tracking design. That means that the thresholds refer to a performance where 50% of the speech could be correctly recognized. In contrast, in our previous study, we used a higher recognition criterion of 75% correct responses (Schelinski & von Kriegstein,  ). Performance accuracy in the present study was about 69%, which is also below 75%. Neural differences found in the present study indicate that speech\u2010in\u2010noise was altered in the ASD group. However, behavioral differences might occur only with higher recognition rates (i.e., when the speech signal is less noisy and thus easier to understand for the control group). Other factors, such as differences in type of background noise, task difficulty, or task design (e.g., speech stimuli) could further contribute to the different study findings. \n\nWe replicate previous findings that voice identity recognition is impaired in ASD (Boucher et\u00a0al.,  ; Klin,  ; Schelinski et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ) and that this impairment is dissociable from intact speech recognition in listening conditions when the speech signal is relatively easy to understand (i.e., presented with continuous pink noise with a relatively high SNR of +3 (Schelinski,  ) or without additional noise during fMRI (Schelinski,  ). Further, our results indicate that voice recognition is affected similarly for the noise and the no noise condition (i.e., there was no task \u00d7 group interaction which would suggest a more pronounced impairment for the noise as compared to the no noise condition). Merging previous and our current behavioral results on voice identity and speech recognition in ASD, we suggest that voice identity recognition is more affected than speech recognition in challenging but also in normal hearing conditions. The investigation of the neural mechanisms of voice identity recognition in noise and its relation to the neural processing of speech recognition in noise is an interesting future research direction. \n\nNoise significantly impacts everyday functioning and can restrict communication (for reviews, see Klatte et\u00a0al.,  ; Picard & Bradley,  ; Szalma & Hancock,  ; van der Kruk et\u00a0al.,  ). For example, restricted perception of what another person is saying in a noisy environment can impede a fluent social conversation and makes a conversation more challenging. Consequently, this leads to enhanced experience of stress in communication (Mackersie & Cones,  ; McGarrigle et\u00a0al.,  ). An enhanced stress experience might in turn lead to avoidance of potentially noisy situations and places which is an often\u2010reported phenomenon for people with ASD (Stiegler & Davis,  ). Here, we provide evidence that difficulties in speech recognition in ASD are not related to a general dysfunction of cerebral brain regions related to basic auditory or speech processing. Our results rather indicate that reduced functioning in the left IFG\u2014a cerebral cortex region particularly related to speech\u2010in\u2010noise perception\u2014might be important in explaining restricted speech comprehension in noisy environments in ASD. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nStefanie Schelinski and Katharina von Kriegstein designed the study.

In order to determine whether, and to what extent, cortical functional neuroanatomy supports a distinction between affective and discriminative touch, an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis was performed. This meta\u2010analysis statistically mapped reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations from 17 published affective touch studies in which tactile stimulation was associated with positive subjective evaluation (  n  \u2009=\u2009291, 34 experimental contrasts). A separate ALE meta\u2010analysis mapped regions most likely to be activated by tactile stimulation during detection and discrimination tasks (  n  \u2009=\u20091,075, 91 experimental contrasts). These meta\u2010analyses revealed dissociable regions for affective and discriminative touch, with posterior insula (PI) more likely to be activated for affective touch, and primary somatosensory cortices (SI) more likely to be activated for discriminative touch. Secondary somatosensory cortex had a high likelihood of engagement by both affective and discriminative touch. Further, meta\u2010analytic connectivity (MCAM) analyses investigated network\u2010level co\u2010activation likelihoods independent of task or stimulus, across a range of domains and paradigms. Affective\u2010related PI and discriminative\u2010related SI regions co\u2010activated with different networks, implicated in dissociable functions, but sharing somatosensory co\u2010activations. Taken together, these meta\u2010analytic findings suggest that affective and discriminative touch are dissociable both on the regional and network levels. However, their degree of shared activation likelihood in somatosensory cortices indicates that this dissociation reflects functional biases within tactile processing networks, rather than functionally and anatomically distinct pathways.

This emotional aspect of touch has been called \u201caffective touch,\u201d a category term capturing tactile processing with a hedonic or motivational component. It has been proposed as a relatively distinct category of touch, with qualitative and anatomical correlates distinguishable from the more well\u2010mapped pathways of \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d [Olausson et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ]. In this perspective, affective touch is functionally distinct from discriminative touch, in that it preferentially weights tactile stimuli in affective, motivational, or hedonic terms, such as valence or reward value. This may be especially relevant in contexts in which touch can carry affective significance, particularly social interactions [Morrison, et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ]. \n\nYet to what extent does the neuroanatomical organization of somatosensory cortices suggest a distinction between affective and discriminative touch? A parsimonious possibility is that processing in discriminative\u2010associated networks such as primary somatosensory cortex (SI) can completely account for affective phenomena in the tactile domain. That is, discriminative terms could be sufficient for coding affectively\u2010relevant variables. On this view, affective processing need not constitute an intrinsic component of the somatosensory domain\u2014after all, affective processing of pictures does not imply a special system for \u201caffective vision.\u201d A similar but less extreme possibility is that discriminative somatosensory networks, such as those involving SI, could play a direct role in hedonic evaluation [Gazzola et al.,  ]. \n\nOn the other hand, emerging evidence supports the possibility that somatosensation   does   involve an intrinsic affective dimension, over and beyond the functional and anatomical scope of classical discriminative somatosensory networks. This evidence stems mainly from the discovery of unmyelinated afferents sensitive to light touch on the skin, called tactile C (CT) afferents [Nordin et al.,  ; Vallbo et al.,  ; Wessberg et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ]. In humans, the mean firing frequency of CT afferents correlates with the mean subjective pleasantness of skin stroking [L\u00f6ken et al.,  , Ackerley et al.,  ], and their signaling is associated with activation of the posterior insular cortex [PI; Olausson et al.,  ; Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et al.,  ; Gordon et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. This evidence increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that affective and discriminative touch are indeed processed in the cortex in a dissociable manner. \n\nThis hypothesis was addressed here using an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis of 17 affective touch studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This meta\u2010analysis revealed peaks with significantly high probability of activation across studies, regardless of variations in methods, stimuli, and experimental paradigms. Its purpose was to identify likely activation hubs robustly implicated in affective touch. To discover the functional specificity of these activations, they were statistically compared to activations reported in studies involving discriminative tactile paradigms. It was predicted that areas consistently reported in affective touch studies, particularly posterior insula, would be dissociable from somatosensory regions activated by discriminative touch paradigms, such as SI. Another aim was to more closely explore any functional specificity of parietal opercular (PO) somatosensory regions, which have been reported in both discriminative and affective touch contexts. \n\nFurther, to determine whether these hubs are associated with different brain\u2010wide networks, a meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis was performed. The aim of the MCAM analysis was to assess differential degrees of functional co\u2010activation across multiple study types, between the affect\u2010related and discriminative\u2010related regions identified by the ALE meta\u2010analysis. Studies of anatomical connectivity in the insula suggest that PI has a relatively close relationship with PO somatosensory networks [Cerliani et al.,  ; Evrard et al.,  ; Kurth et al.,  , Uddin et al.,  ]. The present study hypothesized that affectively\u2010 and discriminatively\u2010biased regions, though each tactile\u2010related and anatomically interconnected, are distinguishable by differential co\u2010activations with other networks throughout the brain. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Meta\u2010Analysis Criteria \n  \n#### Affective touch map \n  \nThe affective touch meta\u2010analysis included published fMRI studies of affective touch (Table  ). Studies published 1999 through early 2015 were identified through knowledge of the field, supplemented by PubMed literature search with keyword combinations \u201caffective\u2009+\u2009touch,\u201d \u201cpleasant\u2009+\u2009touch,\u201d \u201ctouch\u2009+\u2009emotion,\u201d and \u201cfMRI.\u201d The inclusion criteria for \u201caffective touch\u201d were cutaneous tactile stimulation associated with a reported positive hedonic subjective rating (  e.g  ., pleasantness), regardless of stimulation site or stimulus type (  e.g  ., hand, soft velvet, lotion, etc). Studies involving drug manipulations or patient populations were included only if they reported contrasts   within   healthy, drug\u2010free, adult control groups. Studies involving pain and pharmacological manipulations (eg, intranasal oxytocin spray) were excluded, as well as those involving semantic, graphic, or anticipatory manipulations without reporting tactile\u2010only conditions or contrasts (  e.g  . word stimuli independent of tactile stimulation). The resulting dataset consisted of 17 papers (34 experimental contrasts) with a total   N   of 291 unique subjects (with an overall   N   of 552 across all contrasts), and 166 foci (See Table  ). Of these, two studies reported coordinates based on mask or region\u2010of\u2010interest (ROI) restriction not defined by whole\u2010brain contrasts within the same data set (marked in Table  ). \n  \nStudies, stimulus, and foci information for affective touch meta\u2010analysis \n    \n\n#### Discriminate\u2010detect map \n  \nBrainMap's Sleuth software (version 2.32) was used to identify all fMRI studies in the BrainMap database ( ) that reported activation for innocuous cutaneous tactile stimulation with task instructions to   detect   or to   discriminate   the stimulus, regardless of stimulation site or stimulus type (for example, a task to determine the orientation of a textured gradient, or the presence or absence of a tactile stimulus). The same exclusion criteria as the \u201caffective touch\u201d meta\u2010analysis were applied. The resulting dataset consisted of 25 papers, with a total   N   of 1075 subjects across 91 experimental contrasts, and 683 foci (see Supporting Information for reference list). This dataset provided a representative (rather than exhaustive) sample of studies involving discriminative touch (see Supporting Information Fig. S1). \n\n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) Analysis \n  \nALE analysis is a coordinate\u2010based, probabilistic meta\u2010analytic technique for assessing the co\u2010localization of reported activations across studies [Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ]. A first step is the categorization of experiments in the literature, for example by stimulus and/or task. Based on this, whole\u2010brain probability maps are created across the reported foci in standardized stereotaxic space (Talairach or MNI). The present meta\u2010analysis used GingerALE software to create probability maps [ ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Laird et al..,  ; Turkeltaub et al..,  ]. Here, probabilities are modeled by 3D Gaussian density distributions that take into account sample size variability by adjusting the FWHM for each study [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. For each voxel, GingerALE estimates the cumulative probabilities that at least one study reports activation for that locus. This voxelwise procedure generates a statistically thresholded ALE map, assuming and accounting for spatial uncertainty across reports. The resulting ALE values thus reflect the probability of reported activation at that locus, with high values for high probability estimates. This value is tested, using random effects, against the null hypothesis that activation is independently distributed across all studies in the meta\u2010analysis [see Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ]. \n\nCoordinates for all meta\u2010analyses were transformed to MNI space (stereotaxic coordinates of the Montreal Neurological Institute), where necessary. For both meta\u2010analyses here, the Lancaster et al. [ ] transform was applied (Laird et al.,  ); manually in the affective touch loci, and automatically via Sleuth software for the discriminative touch loci. To determine the likely spatial convergence of reported activations across studies, the resulting coordinates were submitted to an ALE analysis using GingerALE software [Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ] and thresholded with a false discovery rate (FDR, pN; Genovese et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ,  ) of q\u2009<\u20090.001 with a 200 mm cluster size threshold. FDR pN does not assume independence and thus provides a strict threshold. Owing to the relatively small sample size of affective touch literature, relatively conservative thresholds were applied. The cluster size threshold applied exceeds the minimum estimated distribution of contiguous volumes across the whole brain [Eickhoff et al.,  ], and is therefore conservative with respect to FDR. Likewise, a conservative mask size was subsequently applied to the resulting statistical maps, to ensure restriction to activations within the brain. The statistical maps were visualized on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) anatomical template using MRIcron software ( ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### ALE Maps \n  \n#### Affective touch map \n  \nThe \u201caffective touch\u201d meta\u2010analysis yielded 3 clusters with significantly high probability of activation across studies: right posterior insula (Ig2), 40, \u221214, 8 (max ALE score 0.028); two peaks in a cluster encompassing right posterior insula and adjacent parietal operculum (Ig2/OP1), 46, \u221226, 22 and 46, \u221216, 10 (max ALE score 0.039 and 0.032 respectively); and left parietal operculum (OP1), \u221254, \u221224, 20 (max ALE score 0.40). See Table   and Fig.  . \n  \nActivation likelihood estimate (ALE) maps and contrasts for affective and discriminative touch.   Upper left panel  : Clusters in posterior insula (40, \u221214, 8) and parietal operculum (46, \u221226, 22; 46, \u221216, 10) with a significantly high likelihood of activation for touch stimulation associated with positive subjective ratings (\u201caffective touch\u201d). Map reflects reported activations across 17 studies (  N  \u2009=\u2009291 unique subjects; see Table  ).   Upper right panel  : Clusters in primary (48, \u221238, 44) and secondary (52, \u221224, 20; \u221258, \u221220, 14) somatosensory cortices with a significantly high likelihood of activation for touch stimulation associated with tactile discrimination tasks (\u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d). Map reflects reported activations across 25 studies,   N  \u2009=\u20091075.   Bottom left panel  : A cluster in posterior insula (42, \u221214, 8) had a significantly higher specific activation likelihood for affective touch, as revealed by a contrast between affective and discriminative ALE maps.   Bottom right panel  : A cluster in primary somatosensory cortex (47,\u201039, 46) had a significantly higher specific activation likelihood for discriminative touch, as revealed by a contrast between discriminative and affective ALE maps (see Table   for other clusters). All maps thresholded at FDR (pN)   q  \u2009<\u20090.001, minimum cluster size 200 mm. All coordinates reported in MNI space. \n    \nClusters revealed by activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta\u2010analysis for affective touch, discriminative touch, and contrasts \n      \nTask\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent network co\u2010activation clusters revealed by meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis for affective touch posterior insula (PI) seed region, discriminative touch primary somatosensory (SI) seed region, and contrasts \n    \n\n#### Discrimination map \n  \nThe detect\u2010discriminate (\u201cdiscrimination\u201d) touch meta\u2010analysis yielded 11 clusters with significantly high probability of activation across studies. These cluster locations are summarized in Table  ; see also Fig.  . The largest of these fell in postcentral somatosensory\u2010related regions: bilateral parietal operculum (OP4), 52, \u221224, 20 and \u221258, \u221220, 14 (max ALE scores 0.51 and 0.038 respectively); and right primary somatosensory cortex (SI), 48, \u221238, 44 (max ALE score 0.043). \n\n\n\n### Contrasts \n  \n#### Affective vs. discriminative touch \n  \nTo discover clusters with a higher likelihood of activation by affective touch compared with discriminative touch, a contrast between the affective and discriminative ALE maps was performed [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. This contrast yielded a single cluster in right posterior insula (Ig2), 42,\u201014, 8 (max ALE score 3.71). See Table   and Fig.  . \n\n\n#### Discriminative vs. affective touch \n  \nTo discover clusters with a higher likelihood of activation by discriminative touch compared with affective touch, a contrast between the affective and discriminative ALE maps was likewise performed. This contrast yielded 3 clusters: postcentral gyrus (SI), 47,\u201039, 46 (max ALE score 3.71); precentral sulcus, \u221240,\u20104, 39 (max ALE score 3.35); and supplementary motor area (SMA), 0,\u20101, 51 (max ALE score 3.71). See Table   and Fig.  . \n\n\n#### Conjunction: affective and discriminative touch \n  \nIn order to determine whether any areas made a statistically comparable contribution to both affective and discriminative likelihood maps, a conjunction (intersection) analysis was performed. Two clusters contributed to both maps, both in parietal operculum bilaterally: right OP4, 48,\u201026, 22 (max ALE score 0.032); and left OP4/1, \u221254,\u201020, 18 (max ALE score 0.031). See Table   and Fig.  . \n  \nSelectivity and bias in somatosensory activation likelihood maps for aspects of affective touch.   Right  : Nonselective secondary somatosensory clusters (48, \u221226, 22; \u221254, \u221220, 18) significantly likely to be activated in both affective and discriminative touch paradigms, as revealed by a conjunction of affective and discriminative touch ALE maps.   Left  : Relative contributions of stimulated skin type (hairy, red; or glabrous, blue) to the affective touch ALE map. Despite an overall sampling bias toward hairy skin stimulation in affective touch studies (78%), 67% of the contributing foci in a PO cluster (46, \u221226, 22) reflect glabrous skin stimulation. All other clusters in the affective touch map reflected a 100% contribution of hairy skin stimulation. Contributions to the right PO cluster (52, \u221224, 20) from the discriminative touch map (overlaid in green) were exclusively from glabrous skin stimulation. All maps thresholded at FDR (pN) q\u2009<\u20090.001, minimum cluster size 200 mm. All coordinates reported in MNI space. \n  \n\n#### Spatial mapping by skin type \n  \nOf the 32 contrasts in the affective touch meta\u2010analysis, 78% involved stimulation of hairy skin, whereas 22% involved stimulation of glabrous skin. To determine whether any region showed disproportionate specificity for glabrous skin inputs sufficient to overcome this sampling bias, the affective touch map was decomposed into separate ALE maps for stimulation on glabrous and hairy skin, applying the same thresholds as the overall map. This revealed a glabrous\u2010specific cluster in right parietal operculum (46,\u201026, 22; Fig.  ), indicating that glabrous\u2010related foci make a differential contribution to the activation likelihood of this region. The peak coordinates for this cluster coincided with the right PO peak in the overall affective touch map, which fell in a cluster contiguous with the right PI peak (see Table  ). It also overlapped with the right cluster for the conjunction between affective and discriminative maps (Table  ; Fig.  ). Peak ALE coordinates for the remaining three clusters reflected contributions from hairy skin stimulation and coincided with the right PI peak, the left PI cluster, and the left PO cluster, respectively. See Table   and Fig.  . \n\nTo confirm relative contributions of skin type (hairy, glabrous) for each of these clusters, the percentage of the foci contributions were calculated for hairy and glabrous skin stimulation on clusters resulting from the affective touch map. This was performed by tallying the foci contributions from reported contrasts involving hairy or glabrous stimulation for each cluster on the overall map. To separate the PO and PI\u2010centered peaks from the contiguous right hemisphere cluster, the map was first re\u2010thresholded at a higher threshold of pN\u2009<\u20090.0001. All previous clusters survived, with reduced extent (compare cluster sizes on Table  , \u201cAffective touch\u201d with \u201cAffective glabrous skin bias\u201d and \u201cAffective hairy skin bias\u201d). This exploration confirmed that the right PO cluster reflects a differential, disproportionate contribution from glabrous skin stimulation, with 67% contributing foci from glabrous skin stimulation and 33% from hairy skin stimulation. In contrast, 100% of the contributing foci to the right PI cluster were from hairy skin stimulation. 100% of foci contributions to the left posterior insula and left PO clusters also came from studies involving hairy skin stimulation. \n\n\n#### Laterality and body part contributions to somatosensory clusters \n  \nSimilarly to the \u201caffective\u201d dataset, low and/or unequal contributions from different body sides and sites limited the statistical power required for refined tests of somatotopic mapping through direct contrasts. Right\u2010side stimulation was predominant in the \u201cdiscriminative\u201d dataset (67% right, 12% left, and 21% both/midline). However, laterality and body part contributions to the three postcentral (putatively somatosensory) clusters yielded by the \u201cdiscriminative\u201d ALE map were examined   post hoc  . Left OP4 (which extended to SI) showed 100% foci contributions from studies in which contralateral body sites were stimulated, with 38% contribution from hand/finger stimulation and 62% contribution from other non\u2010hand sites (  e.g  . arm, foot, leg, wrist, esophagus). Right OP4/1 showed more heterogeneity, with 25% contralateral and 75% ipsilateral contributions, and 32% from hand stimulation and 39% contributions from other sites. The right SI cluster showed 40% foci contributions from studies involving contralateral stimulation and 60% from ipsilateral stimulation, with 100% contributions from studies in which the hand or fingers (glabrous skin) were stimulated. See the Supplementary bibliography for side and site information per study. \n\n\n\n### Meta\u2010Analytic Connectivity Modeling (MCAM) Analysis \n  \nTo discover any task\u2010independent, stimulus\u2010independent, and network\u2010wide functional coactivations with the clusters revealed by the affective and discriminative touch contrast maps, two MCAM analyses were performed [Robinson et al.,  ]. Each used the BrainMap database via Sleuth software ( /). This analysis included 402 experimental contrasts (total   N  \u2009=\u20094913), yielding 6352 foci. Relative to the whole BrainMap database, the profile of the contributing studies reflected a high contribution from the domain categories of action execution, somatosensation, pain, audition, and sexual interoception (see Supporting Information Fig. S2). \n\nFor affective touch, the right PI cluster from the \u201caffective\u2009>\u2009discriminative\u201d contrast was used as a seed for the MCAM analysis. For discriminative touch, the right SI cluster from the \u201cdiscriminative\u2009>\u2009affective\u201d contrast was used as a seed (see Table  ). This resulted in two maps of significantly likely task\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent co\u2010activations across studies: an \u201caffective touch\u201d and a \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d MCAM map (Fig.  ). These maps were then contrasted using GingerALE software, thresholded at pN\u2009<\u20090.01 with a minimum cluster size threshold of 100 mm. A conjunction map was also created, yielding clusters shared by both the \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d MCAM maps. \n  \nTask\u2010 and stimulus\u2010independent network co\u2010activation likelihoods as revealed by meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling (MCAM) analysis.   Left panel  : Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation with the posterior insula seed region defined by the affective\u2009>\u2009discriminative touch ALE map, encompassing clusters in somatosensory regions and insula (red; see Table  ). Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation with the primary somatosensory seed region defined by the discriminative\u2009>\u2009affective touch ALE map, encompassing clusters in somatosensory and lateral premotor regions (green; see Table  ).   Right panel  : Regions with a significant likelihood of co\u2010activation in common between \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d seed regions, encompassing somatosensory cortices, anterior insula, and medial premotor regions. MCAM analysis included 406 fMRI contrasts (  N  \u2009=\u20094913). All maps thresholded at pN\u2009<\u20090.01, minimum cluster size 100 mm. \n  \nThe \u201caffective\u201d MCAM map yielded two large contiguous clusters (13,552 mm  in the left hemisphere and 11,848 mm  in the right) with significantly high probability of co\u2010activation with the PI seed region. These large bilateral clusters encompassed peaks in posterior and anterior insula, postcentral primary and secondary somatosensory regions, striatum (putamen), thalamus, frontal operculum, and medial prefrontal cortex (dACC, SMA, and pre\u2010SMA). The maximum ALE value for this map was 0.35. \n\nThe \u201cdiscriminative\u201d MCAM map yielded 9 clusters with significantly high probability of co\u2010activation with the SI seed region. The largest (> 1000 mm ) included: left lateral inferior premotor cortices, inferior parietal cortex (area 2/PF), SMA, and bilateral angular gyri, medial prefrontal cortex. The maximum ALE value for this map was 0.30. \n\nThe \u201cconjunction\u201d map between the affective and discriminative MCAM maps yielded 16 clusters. The largest (> 1000 mm ) of these were: left SII/SI, left SMA, bilateral striate cortex, bilateral AI, putamen, thalamus, right caudate nucleus, and right inferior parietal cortex (area 2/PF). See Fig.  . \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis revealed dissociable regions for affective and discriminative tactile stimulation (Fig.  ). Namely, PI is more likely to be activated by touch stimuli with a positive hedonic rating than by tasks involving the detection or discrimination of tactile stimuli. In contrast, SI cortices are more likely to be activated by discriminative than affective touch. Secondary somatosensory cortices in parietal operculum, however, share similar activation likelihoods for both affective and discriminative touch (Fig.  ). \n\nThe MCAM analysis indicated that these dissociable regions also involve dissociable general brain\u2010wide networks (Fig.  ). Affective\u2010touch\u2010specific regions are functionally related to insular networks across a range of studies, while regions more likely to respond in discriminative touch tasks consistently co\u2010activate sensorimotor networks. These dissociable networks also overlap in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, underscoring that affective and discriminative touch recruit common components of a sensory network, despite different activation likelihoods within each tactile dimension. \n\n\n## AFFECTIVE TOUCH AND POSTERIOR INSULA \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis indicated that the posterior insula has a high likelihood of selective activation for touch stimuli associated with positive hedonic ratings. The cluster with high activation likelihood for affective touch in this meta\u2010analysis fell in cytological subdivision Ig2 of granular insular cortex. Alongside adjacent granular subregion Ig1, Ig2 has been broadly implicated in a range of somatosensory, visceral, and nociceptive stimulation in humans [Kurth et al.,  ; Segerdahl et al.,  ]. \n\nIn the past two decades, categorical dichotomies between affective and discriminative touch systems [McGlone et al.,  ; Olausson et al.,  ] have drawn on anatomical and physiological distinctions between tactile information carried via two relatively distinct affero\u2010spinal pathways. To a great extent, these pathways correspond to the classical \u201clemniscal\u201d and \u201cextralemniscal\u201d pathways. Tactile signaling in the well\u2010studied lemniscal pathway is fast\u2010conducting and spatially acute, projecting via the dorsal column of the spinal cord, with major terminations in postcentral primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, extralemniscal cutaneous tactile signaling involves slowly\u2010conducting, spatially\u2010diffuse coding, with predominant projections via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and major terminations in posterior insula [Andrew,  ; Craig and Zhang,  ]. \n\nThe contribution of the extralemniscal system may be particularly relevant for the affective touch map. This system includes the spinothalamic tract (STT) projections from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to the brain, via specific suprageniculate thalamic nuclei [Craig and Zhang,  ; Friedman and Murray,  ]. This pathway also receives afferent input from skin receptive fields from CTs, a subtype of unmyelinated C afferent nerve which responds to light, moving touch. CT afferents exhibit increased firing frequency to stroking speeds of around 3 cm/s, which are also rated as most pleasant [Ackerley et al.,  ; L\u00f6ken et al.,  ]. A majority (41%) of projections from the STT pathway have a first cortical synapse in granular insula in the macaque [Dum et al.., 2009]. Consistent with the STT as a CT projection pathway [Andrew,  ], a relationship between CT afferent stimulation by light, pleasant touch and PI activation in humans has been indicated by evidence from patient studies [Olausson et al.,  , 2009]. In healthy subjects, PI activation preferentially increases for CT optimal vs. CT\u2010non\u2010optimal stroking speeds [Bj\u00f6rnsdotter et al.,  ,  ; Morrison et al.,  ], which subjects prefer to receive at above\u2010chance levels [Perini et al.,  ]. \n\nThe correlative relationship between a hedonically\u2010positive subjective experience of touch and CT afferent activity may at least partially account for the high likelihood of PI activation in this meta\u2010analysis. However, it is important to note that velocity\u2010dependent CT firing and hedonic processing may be only indirectly related, or related instead to a common cortical\u2010level variable (for example, specific neurotransmitter release) rather than directly related to each other. Blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) activations in PI for CT\u2010targeted touch have consistently failed to correlate with touch pleasantness measures [Ebisch et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Likewise, positive tactile ratings do not necessarily imply CT\u2010related signaling. The affective touch ALE map included contributions from stimulation of the palm skin, where CTs are absent, and palm stimulation has also been associated with subjective touch pleasantness [Etzi et al.,  ; Kl\u00f6cker et al.,  ; L\u00f6ken et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Yet whether directly or indirectly, the granular region of posterior insular cortex may have a high probability for activation by affective touch by virtue of a critical role in efficient network\u2010wide processing of affectively\u2010relevant somatosensory information [Lovero et al.,  ; Lucas et al., 2014; Perini et al.,  ]. \n\n\n## AFFECTIVE TOUCH AND PARIETAL OPERCULAR REGIONS \n  \nThe ALE meta\u2010analysis also revealed that somatosensory regions on the PO have a high likelihood of being activated for affective touch. However, this activation was not selective, in contrast to the PI cluster. Rather, PO had a similar activation likelihood for both affective and discriminative touch, as revealed by a conjunction between the affective and discriminative ALE maps. \n\nThe clusters with highest shared activation likelihood for affective and discriminative touch fell in two subregions of opercular somatosensory cortex, OP1 and OP3 [Baumgartner et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Kurth et al.,  ]. OP1 lies posterior to OP3, and is the likely human homologue of \u201cclassical\u201d secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex in the monkey [Eickhoff et al.,  ]. It responds to innocuous tactile stimuli as well as nociceptive and vestibular stimulation [Zu Eulenburg,  ]. OP3 lies deeper in the Sylvian fissure and is the likely homologue of the primate \u201cventral somatosensory\u201d area (VS), which is not functionally well\u2010characterized [Eickhoff et al.,  ; Krubitzer and Kaas,  ]. It has been speculated that thalamic inputs to SII and PV are modulatory rather than relaying strictly sensory information [Krubitzer and Kaas,  ; Qi et al.,  ]. \n\nGiven its known functional characteristics, how might PO cortex contribute to the processing of positively\u2010valenced touch? One possibility is that its role may involve higher\u2010order aspects of discriminative somatosensory information (for example, sensorimotor, visuomotor, spatial, etc, integration) that is processed in parallel with more general affective network\u2010wide evaluative processing. Another possibility is that PO regions could process certain aspects of affective touch, integrated via direct cortico\u2010cortical connections with more selective populations in nearby PI [zu Eulenberg, etc; Cauda et al.,  ; Cerliani et al.,  ; Deen et al., 2010; Ebisch et al., 2010; Wei and Bao,  [. Though insular and opercular areas have distinct receptive fields and cytological characteristics, they are closely adjacent and highly interconnected [Evrard et al.,  ; zu Eulenburg et al.,  ]. \n\nLike PI, secondary somatosensory cortices on the PO receive major input from the STT, via anatomical projections from ventroposterior inferior (VPI) nucleus, and minor input from the posterior\u2010suprageniculate complex [Po\u2010Sg; Friedman and Murray,  ]. In nonhuman primates such as the macaque (  Macaca mulatta)   and the marmoset (  Callithrix jacchus  ), SII receives major projections from VPI, whereas this is not clearly the case for VS [Qi et al.,  ]. More generally, PO cortex in the macaque receives 29% of STT inputs, in second place behind granular insular cortex [Dum et al.,  ]. \n\nThe role of human SII cortex in affective touch requires further experimental investigation. For example, quantitative rather than qualitative differences may contribute to its nonselective activation likelihood in this analysis. It is also possible that distinct populations within the operculum have varying degrees of specificity with respect to affective touch processing. A hint of such potential heterogeneity was provided by the decomposition of the affective touch map, which revealed an \u201cisland\u201d of disproportionate contribution from glabrous skin stimulation in the right OP3 peak (Fig.  ). \n\n\n## FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS \n  \nIf cortical\u2010level relationships between affective and discriminative touch are highly interpenetrating and context\u2010dependent, as is likely, approaching the cortical mapping solely with respect to stimulus and afferent input classes will yield limited insight. Instead, clues to more specific functional differences lie at the network level. The MCAM analysis assessed functional connectivity through identifying statistically robust whole\u2010brain coactivations with the PI and PO clusters, respectively, across studies in the whole BrainMap database. This approach focuses on co\u2010activation likelihood with respect to regions of interest, rather than to domains, stimuli, or tasks of interest, and thus uncovers network relationships with a high degree of generality. Importantly, though, a high co\u2010activation likelihood   across   experiments also implies a high co\u2010activation likelihood   within   a given subset or domain [Toro et al.,  ], such as somatosensation, Indeed, the profile of the MCAM dataset showed a large contribution from studies in the somatosensory domain (Supporting Information Fig. S2). \n\nThe MCAM analysis revealed that the PI region identified by the affective touch map and the SI region identified by the discriminative touch map are associated with different network\u2010wide activations. A selective \u201caffective touch\u201d network based on the PI seed involves inter\u2010insula activations bilaterally. This suggests that insular processing is a selective driver of affective touch network activation. In contrast, a selective \u201cdiscriminative touch\u201d network based on the SI seed involves a wider range of co\u2010activation likelihoods. Many of these fall in premotor regions in inferior lateral frontal, medial frontal, and inferior parietal areas. This implies that SI is pivotal within selective discriminative touch networks associated with sensorimotor processing. \n\nThe regional and network activation likelihood differences here can be tentatively viewed in terms of sensorimotor and \u201csomatovisceral\u201d [Norman et al.,  ] systems, respectively. Sensorimotor networks handle complex integration of tactile and motor processing in order to produce goal\u2010directed or exploratory behavior. In primates, distal effectors (hands and feet) and glabrous surfaces (like palms and lips) loom large in sensorimotor processing, as reflected by their disproportionate representation on cortical sensory and motor maps [Penfield and Boldrey,  ], with scope for dynamic plastic changes during behavior [Schaefer et al.,  ]. Goal\u2010directed and exploratory behaviors are also often visually\u2010guided and occur within peripersonal space, making integrated visual, spatial, and body\u2010centered spatial mapping important. Quick and highly\u2010refined online updating of sensory and motor variables is also crucial for such systems during ongoing behavior. Parietal and premotor circuits are primarily associated with these functions [Gallivan and Culham,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, affective touch may involve broad evaluative appraisals that do not necessarily call for millisecond\u2010scale updates. It also involves the integration of different types of information that influence behavior via affective and motivational dispositions, such as preferences [Perini et al.,  ] or hedonic expectations [Ellingsen et al.,  ; Lovero et al.,  ]. It may also involve autonomic and/or visceral efference within the body, such as changes in heartbeat and respiration, or attenuation of threat anxiety [Coan et al.,  ]. The insula's central involvement in the meta\u2010analysis results is consistent with its role in integrating sensory information into higher\u2010level, subjective representations [Craig,  ], as well as its relationship to autonomic efference [Harrison et al.,  ; Seth and Critchley,  ]. In particular, the posterior\u2010anterior insula axis may contribute to affective evaluation in terms of salience [Menon and Uddin,  ; Pessoa,  ], certainty, and/or risk, as has been postulated for the case of pain [Mouraux et al.,  ; Morrison et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. \n\nThe MCAM analysis also showed overlap in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. This suggests that whereas regional activation likelihoods may differ depending on stimulus or behavioral parameters, tactile stimulation recruits somatosensory networks regardless of any affective or discriminative bias. For example, although the affective\u2010touch\u2010associated CT pathway may privilege certain information based on specific ranges of speed [L\u00f6ken et al.,  ] and temperature [Ackerley et al.,  ] variables, any tactile stimulation anywhere on the body will also activate the large myelinated A\u03b2 afferents that project predominantly to somatosensory cortices. \n\n\n## VALUE AND LIMITATIONS OF ALE META\u2010ANALYSIS \n  \nALE meta\u2010analysis represents an estimation of the probability of spatial co\u2010activations, based on coordinates reported in the literature. It provides a way of applying statistical thresholds to large sets of coordinate data, in order to identify the most consistently\u2010activated and reproducible activation loci across many studies. Its value thus lies in spatially mapping those activations which survive the numerous differences in methodology, experimental paradigms, scanner hardware, analysis techniques and software, and sample sizes, as well as differences in individual functional neuroanatomy and stereotaxic normalization procedures. In the present meta\u2010analysis, PI and PO emerged as robust and reproducible regions implicated in affective touch, and these results can provide   a priori   hypotheses for further experimental testing. But by the same token, ALE and MCAM meta\u2010analysis filter out less robust or infrequently\u2010reported foci that may have a greater dependence on the details of individual studies. \n\nFor example, here SI showed no significant likelihood of activation for affective touch. However, it has previously been shown to use visuotactile cues to distinguish between videos of male and female strokers during tactile stimulation of the leg [Gazzola et al.,  ], and it receives high\u2010acuity information from the palm, which is an active \u201ctouch\u2010seeking\u201d surface during social interactions [Ackerley et al.,  ; McGlone et al.,  ; Perini et al.,  ]. Further, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) selectively over right SI has slowed reaction times on a go\u2010no go task following affective touch [Bolognini et al..,  ]. The likelihood of activation for SI may increase as the body of literature grows. \n\nOther areas previously implicated in affective touch networks include the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus [STG and STS; Bennett et al.,  ; Gordon et al.,  ; Kaiser et al.,  ; Singh et al.,  ; Voos et al.,  ]. However, any contribution of STS to affective touch has not been sufficient to produce a high likelihood of activation here. Posterior STS regions implicated in caress stimulation have been engaged by social\u2010specific and biological movement information [Deen et al.,  ], as well as polymodal integration [Beauchamp et al.,  ], sensory imagery [Berger and Ehrsson,  ], and convergent auditory and visual facial information [Ghazanfar et al.,  ]. Any role of superior temporal areas may thus lie in the integration of tactile information with sensory and spatial information from other modalities. For example, posterior STS might contribute to structuring a coherent representation of the touch by via visuospatial imagery for tactile biological motion [Kilintari et al.,  ]. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nThe different activation likelihoods for affective and discriminative touch render it improbable that \u201cdiscriminative\u201d (  e.g  . primary) somatosensory regions are sufficient for affective touch processing. Depending on the context, tactile stimulation may enlist spatially and temporally acute, goal\u2010directed sensorimotor guidance of behavior, or contribute to context\u2010dependent, hedonic or emotional appraisals with influences on bodily regulation. The former is more likely to recruit classical \u201cdiscriminative\u201d cortical sensory regions and networks; while the latter is more likely to recruit insular and PO cortices. However, this does not imply a wholesale distinction between affective and discriminative touch. Rather, cortical processing of the relevant stimulus and task properties may fall along a continuum, with the categories \u201caffective\u201d and \u201cdiscriminative\u201d at the extremes. Or, like pain, they may represent experimentally dissociable dimensions despite operating together inextricably during normal processing [\u201csensory\u201d and \u201caffective\u201d components; Kulkarni et al.,  ; Rainville et al.,  ]. In daily life, tactile interactions with other people may prompt both simultaneously, providing means for not only reaching out and touching someone, but also for feeling and evaluating their touches in return. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5066805, "text_md5": "6d279c08081991d27d1c7f4b5e0e407f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 15], "journal": [16, 30], "publication_year": [32, 36], "title": [47, 143], "keywords": [157, 309], "abstract": [322, 2366], "body": [2375, 42617]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 26873519, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.23103", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066805", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5066805"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066805\">5066805</a>", "list_title": "PMC5066805  ALE meta\u2010analysis reveals dissociable networks for affective and discriminative aspects of touch"}

In this review article, the focus will be on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and its applicability in clinical fMRI studies. In the light of the \u201creplication crisis,\u201d three aspects will be critically discussed: First, the fMRI signal itself, second, current fMRI praxis, and, third, the next generation of analysis strategies. Current attempts such as resting-state fMRI, meta-analyses, and machine learning will be discussed with their advantages and potential pitfalls and disadvantages. One major concern is that the fMRI signal shows substantial within- and between-subject variability, which affects the reliability of both task-related, but in particularly resting-state fMRI studies. Furthermore, the lack of standardized acquisition and analysis methods hinders the further development of clinical relevant approaches. However, meta-analyses and machine-learning approaches may help to overcome current shortcomings in the methods by identifying new, and yet hidden relationships, and may help to build new models on disorder mechanisms. Furthermore, better control of parameters that may have an influence on the fMRI signal and that can easily be controlled for, like blood pressure, heart rate, diet, time of day, might improve reliability substantially. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTranslational neuroscience is an important branch within the broad field of neuroscience. In the context of this opinion article, translational neuroscience will be seen as the attempt of bridging neuroscience, neuroimaging, and clinics for improving our understanding of symptoms and disorders, and for better diagnostics and treatments ( ,  ). \n\nThis is not a new attempt. Neuroimaging, and in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has been considered as a revolutionary tool for exploring the healthy and the diseased brain for more than two decades ( ,  ). Consequently, since fMRI entered the scene in the early 1990s, it had seen an enthusiastic phase over the first two decades. However, after this period, neuroimaging\u2014like almost any other psychological and medical sciences\u2014was overrun by the replication crisis. Recent studies have estimated the reproducibility of psychological studies to be 39% or less and indicated a severe limitation of neuroimaging (fMRI) study reliability ( \u2013 ). Furthermore, the neurophysiological mechanisms behind the BOLD/fMRI signal are only partly understood, which makes it difficult to generalise results or to use it on an individual level for diagnostic purposes. Thereby impeding the impact of highly needed neuroscience studies on theoretical and methodological progress, and, last but not least, the clinical application of fMRI. \n\nIn the following, this article will critically discuss current strategies and developments within the field of neuroimaging and tries to indicate possible future directions. \n\n### The Replication Crisis and Its Consequences \n  \nThe neuroimaging research community has taken the \u201creplication crisis\u201d very seriously, like through the ReproNim initiative ( ), and the Organisation of Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) announced in 2016 a new replication award, and put reproducibility high up on their agenda with several new best practice and data sharing initiatives (see, e.g.,  ). \n\nJointly, psychology and neuroimaging suffer substantially from a lack of statistical power, meaning that the sample sizes are typically too small, and effect sizes are too low ( ). This has not only been perceived as a critical challenge among scientists but has recently also received public attention. On the other hand, clinical applications require reliable single-case examinations but not group studies that may reliably show the general population effect but may vanish the information on interindividual and intraindividual variability. Consequently, the lack of information about the \u201cnaturally\u201d occurring variability hinders the successful development of translational and clinical applications. Already in 2006, Paul Matthews and coworkers critically discussed the applicability of clinical fMRI for other applications than neurosurgical mapping ( ). Although they wrote down their opinion more than a decade ago, it appears like that the development of clinical fMRI is in a \u201cresting state,\u201d as recently pointed out by O\u2019Connor and Zeffiro ( ). Presurgical mapping is still the only reliable and widely used clinical application of fMRI. The critical question is, why haven\u2019t we yet achieved a breakthrough in clinical fMRI? \n\n\n\n## Current Status \n  \nThis article will critically discuss three aspects that are relevant to consider in the context of clinical fMRI: First, the fMRI signal itself, second, current fMRI praxis, and, third, the next generation of analysis strategies. \n\n### The Bold Signal Perturbation \n  \nOne of the major knowledge gaps in the field is the assumption that the fMRI signal, i.e., the underlying BOLD effect (BOLD = blood oxygenation level dependent), is   sufficiently   reliable and stable, where \u201csufficiently\u201d has never been defined yet. It is of crucial importance to keep in mind that the BOLD signal represents only an indirect measure of neuronal activity, through a cascade of physiological processes, called neurovascular coupling. Consequently, the observed variability of the BOLD signal does not necessarily justify the conclusion that the underlying neuronal activity shows variability to the same degree. Scientifically speaking, the BOLD signal is a physiological response that only indirectly reflects neuronal activity, and which is easily and directly influenced by blood pressure, blood oxygenation, or any other parameters that have an effect on the vascular system, which in turn affect the balloon effect that generates the BOLD signal ( ,  ). The corresponding balloon model became the most influential and mostly used model in fMRI research ( \u2013 ). It is a neurophysiological model that describes the neuronal and vascular mechanisms that cause the BOLD signal given a neuronal activity. It rests on the assumption that the BOLD signal is caused by changes in the blood volume, blood flow, and the oxygen extraction rate. It is widely accepted that these are the main parameters that determine the strength of the BOLD signal. The balloon model and its corresponding hemodynamic response function is, for example, an integral part of several analysis models of fMRI data, but also for measures of functional and effective connectivity, like dynamic causal modelling (DCM) ( ). \n\nHowever, it is less studied, how susceptible the BOLD signal is to endogenous and exogenous influences and individual variability of the underlying mechanisms. Hence, it might occur that a change in the BOLD signal is detected while the   true   neuronal activity and connectivity remains unchanged. It is known that hormones (like cortisol), blood pressures, body mass index, time of the day (circadian rhythm), time of the year, sleep duration, and age influence blood volume, blood flow, and other vascular parameter, and hence the BOLD signal ( \u2013 ). Whether the individual variability of these parameters has a significant influence on the BOLD signal is largely unknown. To give another example, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), it has been shown that the individually varying concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is reflected in the amplitude and shape of the BOLD signal ( ). Complementary, comparable effects have been shown for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate ( ,  ). The list of those endogenous parameters can be continued, including parameter that may predominantly affect neuronal signal transmission or vascular processes. In other words, the BOLD signal is most likely not stable within and not necessarily comparable between subjects. These factors are just additional sources of variability of the fMRI signal that comes in addition to all other sources of noise that are affecting the measurement, like other environmental factors, thermal noise, noise of the measurement system itself, movements of the subjects, daylight length, temperature, and whether, to name a few, that may affect brain functions but also the stability of the MR system ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Current fMRI Methods \n  \n#### Current Clinical Applications of fMRI \n  \nAs outlined above, the only routinely used clinical application of fMRI is the presurgical mapping (see  ). This is mostly done in patients with brain tumours or epilepsy, since these diseases may cause substantial displacement of brain functions, and functional mapping with fMRI may help surgeons to localize important areas despite their unusual neuroanatomical localization ( ). However, most of those clinical applications are task-related fMRI with simple paradigms, and the first reports date far back to the beginning of fMRI ( ,  ). \n  \nSchematic overview on reliability and current clinical applications of the different fMRI techniques. \n  \nOne of the most common application is the localization of language areas and their lateralization, which is an essential information in the treatment of patients with epilepsy ( \u2013 ). In most occasions, this clinical application of fMRI shows comparable results as the invasive WADA test but might deviate in cases with atypical language dominance ( ). \n\nGood experience also exists for paradigms probing the localization of motor, sensory, and memory functions, which are often not only used for localization but also for predicting outcome ( \u2013 ). Nowadays, clinical fMRI is often combined with diffusion tensor imaging for localizing relevant fibre tracts ( ). \n\nIn contrast to the presurgical mapping where it is sufficient enough to localize a function, any application in psychiatry, for instance, needs to focus on the strength of activations. Accordingly, there exists no routinely used clinical application of fMRI outside of the field of presurgical mapping due to the lack of sufficient reliability in the measurement of   individual   activation strength\u2014for example task, instruction, and different levels of attention may influence reliability ( ,  ).   Group studies  , by contrast, show a much higher reliability in detecting deviations in activation strength ( ). Therefore, almost exclusively all fMRI studies in psychiatry have explored cohorts of patients (see  ). However, one possible way to circumvent this lack of reliability on the individual level has been recently suggested by Paek et al. in connection with a study on dementia by proposing repeated (baseline) measurements of the patients ( ). \n\nAnother problem in clinical fMRI in psychiatry is the heterogeneity of patient populations. The disorders are often spectrum disorders with a continuum that ranges from normality to pathological ( ), but also that varies between various symptoms and diagnosis, like between schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder ( ). Furthermore, the disorders often manifest in varies subtypes, and different studies may use different diagnostic criteria. Consequently, imaging results often differ substantially even on the level of group studies ( ). \n\n\n#### Is Resting-State fMRI the Solution? \n  \nWhile the first two decades of fMRI were mostly dominated by task-related fMRI, i.e., fMRI acquisitions while research subjects performed an active task, like a working memory, attention, or language task, the more recent years have seen an alternative approach, which is called \u201cresting-state\u201d fMRI (rs-fMRI). Here, research subjects are just scanned over a certain period without any concrete, active task\u2014they are presumably \u201cat rest.\u201d Surprisingly, the measured BOLD signal that is measured during such an rs-fMRI examination is not random but fluctuates in a spatially and temporally systematic manner ( ,  ). It has been shown that even in the absence of a concrete task, certain brain areas are forming networks through characteristic correlated fluctuations of the BOLD signal, called   resting-state   or   intrinsic networks  . These network patterns can be detected by focusing on low frequent (<0.01Hz) fluctuations of the BOLD signal, since these fluctuations propagate through the underlying neuronal network structures, indicating an information exchange within the networks even in the absence of a concrete task. It has been further shown that these networks are very similar across individuals ( ,  ). They are therefore assumed to reflect some fundamental \u2014trait- or biomarker-like \u2014brain processes. \n\nFrom resting-state data, it is possible to identify neuronal networks that show in their spatial organization a striking similarity with those networks that have been identified through task-related fMRI ( ). These networks are often identifiable also on single subject levels, but depends on the method that is used for extracting the information ( ). Since this discovery, there has been a tremendously interest in resting-state fMRI and the examination of the related intrinsic-brain networks and their dynamics ( ,  \u2013 ). One of the most investigated networks in this respect is the \u201cdefault mode network\u201d (DMN) ( ,  ). The DMN network is related to processes, like mind wandering, intrinsically focused attention, daydreaming, etc. Interestingly, there is a counterpart to the DMN, which has been described under different names in the literature. Here, it will be called the \u201cextrinsic mode network\u201d (EMN) and represents a network for extrinsically focused attention ( ). \n\nOne reason why rs-fMRI became such a popular tool in the field of neuroimaging is that it may allow studying cognitive functions even in the absence of a task, which would be an intriguing possibility for doing clinical fMRI, especially in cases where patients are severely affected like after a stroke or traumatic brain injury. Clinical applications of rs-fMRI are based on the assumption of certain interindividual and intraindividual stability of resting-state networks in healthy individuals to draw conclusions from observed deviations in patients. In order to increase comparability and to limit variability in data acquisition between studies, first sets of guidelines for standardized protocols have been developed (e.g., like the \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative\u201d (ADNI);  ), and other initiatives are following their example and have started similar undertakings. \n\nHowever, one major disadvantage of rs-fMRI is that rs-fMRI studies still vary in their acquisition methods and whether they are conducted on a 1.5T, 3T, or 7T MR. The typical approach in rs-fMRI is to do an fMRI scan of several minutes duration with a repetition time (TR) of typically 1\u20133 s. But between studies and labs, there are already at least three different types of instructions, asking the research subjects to either close their eyes, keep them open, or to fixate on a fixation cross. Although the differences between these three possible instructions are moderate, they are still measurable ( ). Interestingly, the most reliable results for most but not all examined networks were achieved when subjects fixated on a fixation cross. It is, however, difficult to control how well an individual followed that instruction as eye-tracking devices or eye cameras are typically not installed inside of an MR scanner and especially not in clinical MR scanners. Furthermore, different TR times may also cause varying results, since periodic signals like heart rate variability or respiration rate might affect results differently ( ,  ). Another factor that varies between different studies and also influences the results is the duration of the resting-state examination that roughly varies between a few minutes and up to 12 min and more. The reliability of specific rs-fMRI seems to improve with scan durations, and acceptable good reliability for both intrasession and intersession rs-fMRI might be around 12 min ( ). \n\nFurthermore, there are also still no standards of how rs-fMRI data should be analysed. Previous studies have applied a wide spectrum of rs-fMRI analysis strategies, with varying levels of reliability ( ,  ). But progress has been made in standardizing some of the procedures for achieving across-site comparability ( ). It is, however, beyond the scope of this article to review all the different methods, but, just as an example, it has been shown that different methods do have different reliability, like measures of the static functional connectivity networks against the temporal dynamics of these networks ( ). \n\nIn addition, rs-fMRI studies are based on the assumption of the inherent stability of the underlying resting-state networks across time and individuals. In other words, one assumes a low intrasubject and intersubject variability with high sensitivity to clinical deviations. This assumption has, however, never been thoroughly tested and might not be justifiable. There are only sparse and inconsistent reports that resting-states are indeed resting-traits ( ), while the majority of reports point out that intraindividual variation can depend on environmental and psychological effects ( \u2013 ). Another source of variability is the time of the day and time of the year. In an effortful longitudinal study of a single subject over 3.5 years, Choe et al. could show that there were systematic variations with a \u201csignificant linear trend, annual periodicity, and persistence\u201d ( ). Others have found that resting-state activity varies with the circadian rhythm ( ), sleep duration ( ), prior events ( ), or mood ( ). But also the metabolic state of hunger against satiety has a measurable effect on various resting-state measures ( \u2013 )\u2014and the list of factors influencing rs-fMRI and/or the BOLD signal could be continued endlessly. \n\nIn summary, while acquisition methods and analysis strategies can be standardized, it will become challenging to control for additional endogenous and exogenous factors in a daily clinical routine. Although all mentioned factors might only have a moderate effect on resting-state measures, in the light of clinical applications, they may be in the same range that differentiates between patients and healthy controls. It is therefore questionable whether rs-fMRI will ever make it into a clinical tool. One might speculate, whether the reliability of task-related fMRI, with concrete tasks that requires focusing the attention, might be more superior and more suitable for clinical application ( ,  ,  ). \n\n gives a schematic overview on reliability and current clinical applications of task-related and resting-state fMRI, separated for both single subject and group-level studies. \n\n\n\n### Next-Generation Data Analyses \n  \n#### Are Meta-Analyses the Solution? \n  \nIn the light of increasing computational power, cloud computing, and open-access databases with thousands of datasets, meta-analyses became increasingly popular. Meta-analyses are a suitable tool for examining general network structures for a given cognitive task, and which areas, on average, show deviating effects in large patient populations. They may become important cornerstones for building new and more fine-grained models for various disorders. \n\nBut, like any emerging new method, the methods behind meta-analyses of large datasets are still under development and standards needs to be established ( ). This implies that meta-analyses are not necessarily comparable and may suffer from the publication bias ( ). This has been a known issue for decades since it has been noted that meta-analyses and randomized control studies may show different results ( ), but methods are under development that control for potential biases ( ). Furthermore, pure meta-analyses may not be the most sufficient way to go, since they often provide us only with very general common-sense solutions, that do not go much beyond to those functional lesion maps that already have been drawn in the first half of the last century ( ,  ). As a side note, already then, the posterior cingulate cortex has been associated with self-awareness, which is nowadays called the \u201cdefault mode network.\u201d Or, another example, there is a striking functional and structural similarity between Kleist maps, based on brain lesions and injuries, and the meta-analysis of neuroimaging data on language functions ( ). \n\nIn summary, meta-analyses are important contributors in revising and updating our understanding of the structural and functional organization of cognitive functions, and how structure and function interact. Focusing either only on lesions or only on fMRI results may not be sufficient enough for building new and more integrative and holistic theories of brain functions and sources of brain disorders. One way of achieving this is, for example, joining structural lesion maps with results from functional imaging within one multivariate analysis ( \u2013 ). \n\n\n#### Is Machine Learning the Solution? \n  \nOver the most recent years, meta-analyses have been supplemented with machine- and deep-learning methods that can extract (partly hidden) information out of the data and may be able to detect a pattern that is not observable otherwise. The main characteristic that differentiates deep learning from other classifier approaches, e.g., for identifying subpopulations in a multimodal data space, is that features are learned automatically and do need a feature selection as a preceding step, which removes subjectivity and substantially improves accuracy ( ). Deep learning has shown superior performance in detecting cross-modality relations and has attracted a substantial amount of attention among researchers from various fields. Furthermore, it has been nominated as one of the \u201c10 breakthrough technologies\u201d by MIT Technology Reviews ( ). Another advantage of deep-learning methods are their depth and breadth in model building, which may uncover hidden relations between factors that are of relevance for future clinical applications of fMRI in psychiatry ( \u2013 ). \n\nHowever, one potential problem with machine-learning approaches might be, however, the problem of overfitting which may compromise generalization of the results ( ). Overfitting means that the algorithm finds a solution that perfectly parameterises the given dataset but may fail to classify new data correctly. One reason for overfitting is the use of too-small sample sizes as training data ( ). But the field of machine learning has been hit by the replication crisis, as well ( ). This is most like caused by insufficiently shared code and (training) data. Accordingly, the use of machine- and deep-learning methods is only justifiable in combination with large-scale open-access databases and open-source software. \n\nIn summary, machine-learning approaches are a promising move toward new discoveries of hidden relationships. Once reliable patterns have been identified and validated across different databases, one could expect that these approaches will bring us much closer to clinical applications of single-subject fMRI, as they may allow identifying fingerprints for certain disorders. But, it is still a long way to go until we will see clinical fMRI for diagnostic purposes, since, despite promising progress, the most recent developments are still in their infancies. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion: the Next Steps in Translational Neuroscience \n  \nTranslation neuroscience is a rapidly expanding field. If one takes the term literally, it means translating one concept from one domain or scientific discipline into another. In the field of neuroscience, it actually could be thought both ways, either translating a clinical concept into something that is measurable with neuroscientific methods and, the other way around, translating results from neuroscience into clinical praxis. The first way would lead to a better understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of a disorder, while the other way focuses more on the benefits of the patients. However, the issues raised above have to be taken into account for any translational research, whether it is for explorative purpose or diagnostics. The replication crisis might have triggered a new way of think and further attempts to exploring underlying mechanisms. Especially the recent years has seen an increasing interest in exploring all kind of endogenous and exogenous factors that might influence not only brain functions but also the mechanisms that generate the BOLD signal. Some of them have been discussed above, but the list of influencing factors is far from being complete. Moreover, it should highlight that there are indeed several processes that can affect the physiological and vascular basis of the BOLD signal but not necessarily the underlying neuronal mechanisms and activations, like the current blood pressure. Other factors, by contrast, might have a systematic effect on brain functions but do not have anything to do with the neurological or psychiatric disorder that should be examined, like the current phase of the circadian rhythm or the time point of the last meal. Or other factors are purely technical, like temperature, technical noise of the MR system. The influence of these factors might be boosted by the combination with nonstandardized fMRI acquisitions, different instructions (e.g., in rs-fMRI eyes open, eyes closed), nonstandardized analysis methods, less suitable algorithms. While there is an increasing number of reports recommending larger-sample sizes (n > 100) for improving reliability ( ), other attempts are needed to improve single-subject fMRI ( ), which are compulsory for pushing forward clinical fMRI. \n\nConcerning the aspect of larger sample-sizes, this is mandatory for basic research of neuronal correlates of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Those studies are needed for building models and testing hypothesis of the source of a disorder and its progression. This needs a clear conceptualization of what neurobiological or cognitive components may cause the disorder, and how they can be measured with, for example, neuroimaging. While in some disorders, this might be a rather trivial endeavour, psychiatric disorders are often lacking such a definite relationship. However, machine-learning and big-data approaches may help uncovering hidden relationships and are promising strategies in current research applications ( ). An often seen problem within fMRI studies is the huge overlap of results across different cognitive tasks and domains. As pointed out by Hugdahl and coworkers, the fronto-parietal attention network, aka EMN, is virtually activated every time the attention is focused on an extrinsic task ( ). Such an unspecific but the fMRI results dominating activation pattern is difficult to interpret in the light of psychiatric disorders where problems may arise in one particular cognitive domain but not in others. Group studies and meta-analyses may provide the sufficient power to study also subtle effects within the EMN that may relate to psychiatric disorders, but the back translation into diagnostic attempts are difficult to achieve. However, one might also have to rethink the concept of certain disorders. Many psychiatric disorders are nowadays formulated and specified as spectrum disorders, forming a gradient from healthy to severely affected with perhaps varying probabilities of certain comorbidities, with unclear aetiologies. Accordingly, it is less likely that one is able to identify one single spot in the brain or one single deviation in a biomarker that causes this particular set of symptoms. Furthermore, there are often unclear and not directly related functional-structural relationships. For example, functional differences seen in rs-fMRI data from patients with depression ( ) may not directly correspond to deviations seen in structural data ( ). Accordingly, the cognitive and neurobiological models of psychiatric disorders may take into account that the spectrum of a disorder has multiple sources and that structural and functional causes may or may not depend on each other. Unfortunately and despite uncountable neuroimaging studies and meta-analyses, neuroimaging results have yet not been used for redefining and specifying diagnostic categories, as, for example, specified by the DSM5 ( ). \n\nConcerning the translation from neuroimaging results in clinical praxis, i.e., using fMRI for diagnostics, this is an even more difficult attempt. As outlined earlier, clinical fMRI is routinely used only for presurgical mapping but not for diagnostic purposes per se, and in particular not for diagnostic purposes in psychiatric disorders. The fMRI signal is too easily affected by many different endogenous and exogenous factors that are difficult to control. Even with standardized acquisition and analysis protocols, substantial and clinically irrelevant variations in individual fMRI results will be still present. Moreover, these variations are most likely at the same magnitude as the deviation from the mean that one would expect in a patient. This problem is further amplified by the fact that many disorders are spectrum disorders with gradual deviations. However, advanced machine-learning approaches that have been applied to large databases achieved, for example, for the classification of autism spectrum disorders already accuracies of 70% ( ) to 90% ( ). Interestingly, both studies used the same dataset but different algorithms, indicating that the selection of the algorithms can bias the results. Furthermore, there has not been reached a consensus yet, which algorithms are superior or recommended for fMRI data in general or for the classification of specific disorders in particular. But further methodological progress and better standardizations can be expected in the near future. \n\nBesides using fMRI for diagnostics and classification of patients, there have also been attempts at using fMRI for the development of drugs and validating of drug effects ( ). However, also this field of translational neuroscience still suffers from the replication crisis, publication bias, and the lack of standard acquisition and analysis methods. Hence, there is currently only very limited applicability of fMRI for this purpose, as well. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, developments and progress have been and will be made in all domains, covered by this article. The replication crisis has pushed the development of new strategies, like the ReproNim initiative, that will help to standardize acquisition and analysis pipelines. Furthermore, the increased computational power and the continually growing number of available open-access databases with large sample-sizes and longitudinal data will allow the generation of \u201cnorm\u201d-databases that can describe the distribution and interindividual variability of cognitive functions and network structures. Longitudinal data that are increasingly available will also give a better picture of disease progression. Machine-learning approaches will become better and more reliable in identifying disorders from multiple sources. All these approaches may lead to redefinitions of symptoms and may give a clearer picture of the causes of various spectrum disorders. Whether this will finally lead to clinical fMRI as a diagnostic tool is difficult to predict, since the variability of the BOLD signal is still an unresolved issue. In light of that, rs-fMRI currently does not appear as a tool that shows sufficient reliability and stability within and between subjects. The most reliable way of conducting rs-fMRI might be in combination with a fixation task and at least 12-min scan duration. By contrast, task-related fMRI that require focused attention of the subject might have better reliability and hence predictive value on the single-0subject level but would require a careful selection of clinically relevant paradigms. Here, better theoretical models have to be developed for translating clinical concepts into meaningful fMRI paradigms. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to acquire the data (in particular rs-fMRI) approximately at the same time of the day, and a sleeping and diet protocol could explain further, but irrelevant variability. Meta-analyses, in turn, might help in identifying precisely clinical concepts. In essence, after almost three decades, fMRI has generated substantial new insights into neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has produced a vast amount of data and triggered the development of new methods both for data acquisition and data analysis. Although the reliability of fMRI is still limited and hinders its use for diagnostic purposes in a daily clinical routine, the field of translational neuroscience is continuously moving toward more standardized, more reliable, and more clinical relevant applications of fMRI. \n\nIn essence, it is not unlikely to expect that clinical fMRI will at one point go beyond its current presurgical application and toward more diagnostic applications. This will be achieved by improved and standardized methods, better understanding of the neurovascular-coupling mechanisms, and revised models of psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nThe author KS did the literature research and wrote the paper without any further assistance. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nKS is funded through a grant by the Research Council of Norway (276044/ \u201cWhen default is not default: Solutions to the replication crisis and beyond\u201d). \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest \n  \nThe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\nThe handling editor declared a past co-authorship with the author KS. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6960120, "text_md5": "de5f7a39cd29c0751af7af1517f7eee5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 15], "journal": [16, 32], "publication_year": [34, 38], "title": [49, 124], "keywords": [138, 266], "abstract": [279, 1661], "body": [1670, 34080]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31969840, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00924", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6960120", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6960120"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6960120\">6960120</a>", "list_title": "PMC6960120  Current Challenges in Translational and Clinical fMRI and Future Directions"}
{"text": "Mutschler, Isabella and Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas and Glauche, Volkmar and Demandt, Evariste and Speck, Oliver and Ball, Tonio\nPLoS One, 2007\n\n# Title\n\nA Rapid Sound-Action Association Effect in Human Insular Cortex\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nLearning to play a musical piece is a prime example of complex sensorimotor learning in humans. Recent studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) indicate that passive listening to melodies previously rehearsed by subjects on a musical instrument evokes differential brain activation as compared with unrehearsed melodies. These changes were already evident after 20\u201330 minutes of training. The exact brain regions involved in these differential brain responses have not yet been delineated. \n\n\n## Methodology/Principal Finding \n  \nUsing functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated subjects who passively listened to simple piano melodies from two conditions: In the \u2018actively learned melodies\u2019 condition subjects learned to play a piece on the piano during a short training session of a maximum of 30 minutes before the fMRI experiment, and in the \u2018passively learned melodies\u2019 condition subjects listened passively to and were thus familiarized with the piece. We found increased fMRI responses to actively compared with passively learned melodies in the left anterior insula, extending to the left fronto-opercular cortex. The area of significant activation overlapped the insular sensorimotor hand area as determined by our meta-analysis of previous functional imaging studies. \n\n\n## Conclusions/Significance \n  \nOur results provide evidence for differential brain responses to action-related sounds after short periods of learning in the human insular cortex. As the hand sensorimotor area of the insular cortex appears to be involved in these responses, re-activation of movement representations stored in the insular sensorimotor cortex may have contributed to the observed effect. The insular cortex may therefore play a role in the initial learning phase of action-perception associations. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInterest in the functional linkage between the auditory and motor systems has increased in the last few years. Auditory-motor integration has been investigated in musical performance and training, and in connection with every-day action-related sounds  ,  . For instance, silent tapping of a violin concerto has been found to be associated with greater activation of the primary auditory cortex in professional musicians than in non-musicians  , suggesting a functional link from the motor to the auditory system that is sensitive to training. Conversely, there is also evidence for a functional link from the auditory system to the motor system: For instance, passive listening to action-related sounds such as the sound of ripping a sheet of paper activates a left-hemispheric temporo-parieto-premotor circuit that includes the supplementary motor area (SMA) and Broca's area. This finding has been interpreted in favor of the existence of an \u2018auditory mirror neuron system\u2019 in humans  . The sound-action associations investigated in this study were evolutionarily novel, and it has therefore been argued that the observed \u2018mirror\u2019 activations reflect   learned   associations between novel actions and their sounds that were established over a long time before the actual experiments  . \n\nRecent studies have addressed the question of how processing of auditory stimuli changes following acquisition of sound-action associations. Bangert and colleagues   investigated cortical activation patterns using DC-EEG-recordings obtained in subjects who listened passively to a musical piece before and after learning to play the piece on the piano. The recordings showed wide-spread EEG potential changes over fronto-parietal areas that were already present after the first training session. The authors interpreted their findings as an indication of auditory sensorimotor co-activation. Using a similar learning paradigm, we investigated non-musicians who were instructed to learn simple melodies on a piano with their right hand  . Single pulse-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) obtained by stimulation above the left hemisphere were recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the right hand prior to and after the learning procedure while subjects listened passively to the learned melodies, unknown melodies, and to white noise. We found a trend toward greater amplitudes of MEPs during the exposure to learned melodies than during exposure to novel melodies or noise. Also using TMS, D'Ausilio and co-workers   compared motor cortical excitability during passive listening to previously rehearsed piano melodies with passive listening to control melodies. This study also demonstrated motor cortical excitability changes for the rehearsed compared to the unrehearsed piece. \n\nThe techniques used in these previous studies allow however only a limited assessment of the exact cortical networks that generate the observed effects. EEG signals measured on the scalp surface as in the study of Bangert and colleagues   do not directly indicate the exact number and position of the underlying generators. This is due to the blurring effect of the interposed volume conductor and the ambiguity of the resulting electromagnetic inverse problem [for a recent review see  ]. TMS procedures as used in the studies cited above  ,   evaluate neuronal excitability only in the few square cm of cortex that are directly targeted by the stimulation coil  ,  . The results obtained do not indicate which subcortical and/or up-stream cortical areas shape the observed motor cortical excitability changes. \n\nIn view of the preceding considerations, the aim of the present study was to apply an imaging method with high localization accuracy in order to determine the brain areas responsible for the differential brain responses to rehearsed musical pieces. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated healthy subjects during the presentation of actively and passively learned piano melodies. Our results provide the first evidence that, compared with passively learned melodies, actively learned melodies evoke increased fMRI responses already after training periods of 30 minutes or less in the left anterior insula overlapping the insular sensorimotor hand representation area. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTen subjects without any previous experience in playing the piano and without any other professional music education took part in this study (5 females, 5 male, mean age\u200a=\u200a27.1 years, age range\u200a=\u200a20\u201341 years) after giving written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Freiburg, Germany. All participants were healthy, with no past history of psychiatric or neurological disease or hearing problems. Subjects were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  : mean\u200a=\u200a89.3%, range\u200a=\u200a67\u2013100%. \n\n\n### Stimuli and Procedure \n  \nSubjects learned with their right hand to play two simple melodies on a piano ( ). Five subjects learned melodies 1 and 4 and five subjects learned melodies 2 and 3 by rehearsing the melodies, that is, by alternating between listening and playing (\u2018actively learned melodies\u2019). Subjects were blindfolded to ensure that learning relied on auditory feedback. Additionally, subjects were familiarized with two other melodies without playing them (\u2018passively learned melodies\u2019). The experimental set-up consisted of a Yamaha Disklavier connected to a computer. The melodies were presented using Cubase VST/32 R.5 (Steinberg) software. The learning criterion for each melody was to be able to play the tune twice without making a mistake. After fulfilling the learning criterion for the first melody, subjects learned to play the second melody. In addition, subjects learned the remaining two melodies passively by listening to each melody 10 times (\u2018passively learned melodies\u2019). To ensure that actively and passively learned melodies had the same degree of familiarity, we conducted a performance test for familiarity: the four melodies were presented in random order and slight variations were built into 7 of the 15 repetitions of each melody. This was achieved by shifting the pitch of a single note in the first, the second or the third bar to either a note higher or a note lower than in the original version. Subjects were required to indicate with a computer mouse whether the melodies corresponded with the original version of the melody or not. No feedback was given as to the correctness of the subjects' answers. The stimuli of the performance test for familiarity were presented to the subjects using in-house developed software and the sound module of the Yamaha Disklavier with headphones (Hanumpa, Digital Pro-H700, Tempest). Together, the learning phase and the detection task lasted approximately 60 minutes. After a time interval of 20 minutes, an fMRI experiment was conducted, in which the actively and passively learned piano melodies (wave files) were presented in random order via magnetic resonance compatible headphones (Nordic Neuro Lab Norway) to the subjects, using an in-house developed presentation software. Subjects viewed a fixation cross during the experiment and were instructed to listen attentively to the music and to avoid any overt movement. Each stimulus began with a written instruction presented on the screen (\u2018music starts\u2019). Each melody was presented 10 times, and lasted 9 seconds. After each melody presentation a period of 15 sec. without music presentation followed. Functional and structural measurements lasted 25 minutes. \n   Active/passive melody learning task.  \nSubjects learned to play two unknown melodies on a piano (actively learned melodies, marked \u2018A\u2019) and were passively familiarized with two other melodies (passively learned melodies, marked \u2018P\u2019). The assignment to the two learning conditions was balanced across subjects. \n  \nAfter the fMRI measurement subjects self-assessed valence (ranging from 0\u200a=\u200aunpleasant to 6\u200a=\u200apleasant) and arousal (ranging from 0\u200a=\u200acalming to 6\u200a=\u200aarousing) of the actively and passively learned melodies. In addition, participants rated their tendency to execute hand movement, to imagine hand movement (both ranging from 0\u200a=\u200anone, 1\u200a=\u200ararely, 2\u200a=\u200afrequently, to 3\u200a=\u200aall the time) and mode of movement imagination (ranging from 0\u200a=\u200apurely visual, 3\u200a=\u200avisual and kinaesthetic to 6\u200a=\u200apurely kinaesthetic). Lifetime musical education was assessed using a questionnaire translated and modified from Litle and Zuckerman   to ensure that subjects had not played the piano before the experiment. \n\nAn analogous experimental procedure has been successfully used in a previous pilot study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  . Preliminary results of the present fMRI study have previously been presented in abstract from  . \n\n\n### Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nFunctional and structural images were acquired on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Trio, Erlangen, Germany). Structural T1-weighted images with 1 mm isotropic resolution were obtained using the MPRAGE sequence. Functional images were acquired using a multislice gradient echo planar imaging method (EPI). Within 44 sagittal slices the entire brain was included (TR 3000 ms, TE 30 ms, 90\u00b0 flip angle, 3 mm isotropic resolution). Phase encoded direction was anterior-posterior. The sagittal slice orientation resulted in significantly lower acoustic noise generated by the imaging gradients, enabling a better auditory stimulus perception. In addition, this orientation in combination with the thin slice thickness reduced the signal loss to give more reliable detection of activation. \n\nAccurate registration of the functional and structural images was ensured by correcting the EPI data for geometric distortions  . The distortion field was derived from the local point spread function in each voxel determined in a one minute reference scan. Prior to distortion correction, the data was motion corrected by registration to the position of the reference scan. Motion and distortion correction were performed online during the reconstruction process. \n\n\n### MRI Data analysis \n  \nThe data of the subjects' ratings and the detection rate of melody variations in the performance test for familiarity were analyzed with SPSS 13.0 by calculating non-parametric tests (sign test). For spatial pre-processing and statistical analyses of the functional MR data, the statistical parametric mapping software package (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used. All functional images were realigned to the mean EPI volume, normalized into standard stereotaxic space (MNI template provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute), and smoothed using an 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The two music conditions were modeled with a box-car function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function in the General Linear Model of SPM5. A high-pass filter with a cut-off of 1/128 Hz was applied to the voxels' time series. For the statistical analysis, t-contrast images of actively learned>passively learned melody presentation were calculated at the individual level and were used for the random effects second-level analyses (one sample T-test). Additionally, we calculated group level regression analyses with the following parameters as regressors: (1) the subjects' rating of their tendency to movement imagination, (2) the total number of learning trials needed by each subject to reach the learning criterion for the actively learned melodies, and (3) the difference of correctly identified variations for the actively learned melodies minus for the passively learned melodies (\u2018familiarity difference\u2019), \n\nFor the main contrast of interest, namely listening to actively>passively learned melodies, we report results at p<0.005, k>100, and Z-score>3.0 in the   a priori   regions of interest. As summarized in the introduction, the results of previous studies indicate a sensorimotor co-activation when listening to rehearsed pieces. We therefore defined as our   a priori   region of interests the sensorimotor cortical regions subserving hand motor control (including the primary, premotor, supplementary motor, and cingulate motor areas, as well as the sensorimotor region of the insula and fronto-opercular cortex  ). There were no activations in the correlation analyses at this threshold. In addition, we show whole brain results at a lower statistical threshold of p<0.05, k>\u200a=\u200a50, and Z-score>2.25. To assign peaks-activations to anatomical areas, the SPM Anatomy Toolbox   was used. For each BOLD signal change peak the corresponding macro-anatomically defined brain region, the probabilities of belonging to the currently available micro-anatomically defined brain areas, and the maximum-probability-map   based peak assignment to the probabilistic-anatomical maps were determined. \n\n\n### Meta analysis of previous insular movement related fMRI activation \n  \nTo delineate the region of the insular cortex showing consistently hand movement-related fMRI activation, a meta-analysis of previous fMRI studies was carried out. Studies included in the meta-analysis had to fulfill the following criteria: (1) they had to report hand or finger movement-related BOLD signal changes in right-handed healthy adult subjects, (2) coordinates had to be given either in Talairach or in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space. 20 studies meeting these criteria were surveyed  \u2013 . In total, 42 stereotaxic coordinates (23 on the left, 19 on the right hemisphere) were analyzed. Talairach coordinates were translated to match the MNI space. The reported foci were treated as localization probability distributions centered at the given Y and Z peak coordinates  . The probability distribution was modeled by two dimensional Gaussian functions with 8mm FWHM both in the Y and Z direction. Since the included functional imaging data was preprocessed by spatial filtering using Gaussian kernels, this use of Gaussian functions yields an approximation of the volumes underlying the published peak data. The FWHM of 8 mm used for this analysis is within the range of the smoothing filters used in the original studies included in the meta-analysis (from 4 mm to 12 mm). Subsequently an \u2018activation likelihood estimate\u2019 (ALE)  , given by the union of the probabilities associated with the different foci, was calculated for an area comprising the whole Y and Z extent of the insular cortex. The later was determined by manual segmentation from the T1-multi-subject template provided with SPM5. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAcross subjects, the mean number of learning trials needed to reach the learning criterion for both of the actively learned melodies was 20.5 (range 10 to 40 trials). There was no significant difference between the learning trials needed for the first and second melody (p>0.6). First learned melody: mean\u200a=\u200a10.4 trials, SD\u200a=\u200a5.4 trials; second learned melody: mean\u200a=\u200a10.1 trials, SD\u200a=\u200a5.86. In six subjects, the number of learning trials was equal for the first and second melody. Two participants needed more and two subjects fewer learning trials for the second as compared with the first melody. There was no significant difference between the number of learning trials for the passively learned melodies (i. e. 10 trials for each melody) and the number of learning trials for the actively learned melodies (sign test, p>0.3). Due to the longer intervals between consecutive melody presentations, the mean total duration of the active learning part of the experiment was longer than the total duration of the passive learning part (15.5 min vs. 8.4 min). \n\nThe results of the melody-variation detection task are given in  . Mean number of correctly identified pieces for the actively learned melodies was 28.3 (SD\u200a=\u200a2.0) and for the passively learned melodies 27.2 (SD\u200a=\u200a2.66). This tendency to a slightly higher detection rate in the actively learned melodies was not significant at p<0.05 (p\u200a=\u200a0.0625, paired sign test). \n   Melody-Variation-detection task.  \nSubjects learned to play two unknown melodies on a piano (actively learned melodies, marked \u2018A\u2019) and were passively familiarized with two other melodies (passively learned melodies, marked \u2018P\u2019). The assignment to the two learning conditions was balanced across subjects.For each of the ten subjects, the number of correctly identified melodies (either as original or as variation) is given in red for the actively learned melodies and in blue for the passively learned melodies. The total number of trials for each case was 30. The difference between correct trials for the actively and passively learned melodies was used for a correlation analysis to evaluate familiarity effects in the functional data (see below). \n  \nMean valence and arousal ratings for the actively learned melodies were 2.6 and 2.4, for the passively learned melodies 2.5 and 2.3. There were no significant differences for arousal and valence ratings between the actively and passively learned melodies at (p>0.9). All subjects rated their tendency to movement execution as \u2018none\u2019, consistent with the visual inspection of the subjects by the experimenter. Mean rating of the tendency to movement imagery was 1.0 (corresponding to \u2018rarely\u2019); the mode of imagery was rather visual than kinaesthetic (mean 0.87). \n\nLarger BOLD effect during listening to the actively than during listening to the passively learned melodies was found in the left anterior insula (we report results at p<0.005, k>100, Z-score>3.0 uncorrected for multiple comparisons in the   a priori   regions of interest, e.g. the cortical motor areas,  ). The activation cluster comprised 147 voxels (cluster level P-value for   a priori   region of interest 0.006) and showed three local maxima with a Z-score>3.0 (see  ) in the anterior insular cortex. The cluster also extended into the adjacent inferior frontal gyrus/pars opercularis. Additionally, peak locations of BOLD signal changes in the same contrast at a lower threshold (p<0.05, Z>2.25, k>50) are given in  . Brain regions with peaks observed at this lower threshold included the middle temporal gyrus and Broca's area. \n   Differential responses to actively and passively learned melodies.  \nIncreased BOLD effect in response to the actively learned melodies compared with the passively learned melodies was located in the left anterior insula, extending to the deep fronto-opercular cortex (p<0.005, k>100, Z-score>3.0, slices are at x\u200a=\u200a\u221239 and y\u200a=\u200a9). \n     For each BOLD signal change, peak MNI-coordinates and z-score are given.        \nThere were no significant effects at the high threshold (p<0.005, k>100, Z>3.9) in the correlation analyses with ratings of tendency to movement imagination, number of learning trials, and familiarity differences between the two classes of melodies. At the lower threshold (p<0.05, Z>2.25, k>50), results from the correlation analyses with the subjects' ratings of their tendency to movement imagination are summarized in  . Areas with a positive correlation to imagination ratings included the primary visual, primary somatosensory, and primary motor area. Positive regression with the number of learning trials needed to reach the learning criterion showed predominantly sub-cortical effects, especially in the cerebellum ( ), while negative correlations with the number of learning trials were observed pre-dominantly in cerebral cortical areas, in particular in the dorsal premotor cortex ( ). Finally, a correlation with familiarity differences between actively and passively learned melodies was, among other areas, found in Broca's area (BA 45,  ). Importantly, even at the low statistical threshold, none of the correlation analyses showed effects in the anterior insular cortex. \n   Summary of peak locations of BOLD signal change correlated to the subjects' tendency to movement imagination (p<0.05, K>50, Z-scores>2.25).           Summary of peak locations of BOLD signal change positively correlated to the number of learning trials the subjects needed before reaching the learning criteria (p<0.05, K>50, Z-scores>2.25).           Summary of peak locations of BOLD signal change negatively correlated to the number of learning trials the subjects needed before reaching the learning criteria (p<0.05, K>50, Z-scores>2.25).           Summary of peak locations of BOLD signal change positively correlated with individual familiarity-differences (familiarity with actively learned minus passively learned melodies, p<0.05, K>50, Z-scores>2.25).        \nThe activation likelihood estimate (ALE) map obtained from the meta-analysis of hand movement-related fMRI responses in the insular cortex is shown in  . Highest ALE values were found in the region of the anterior insular cortex ranging from approx. Y\u200a=\u200a0 to Y\u200a=\u200a20 and Z\u200a=\u200a\u221210 to Z\u200a=\u200a10.

The dashed line indicates the approximate outline of the left insula. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study we show a change in sound-elicited brain activations when the same sounds are associated with active hand movement, and that this effect is evident already after a short (30 minutes and less) time of training. To investigate sound-action association effects, we used a paradigm in which subjects learned to play two simple melodies on the piano. Brain responses associated with listening to these \u2018actively learned melodies\u2019 were compared with those associated with \u2018passively learned melodies\u2019, that is, melodies with which subjects were familiarized by passive listening only. We found significantly increased fMRI responses to the actively learned melodies in the left anterior insular cortex, overlapping the insular sensorimotor hand representation area as determined by meta-analysis of published hand movement-related insular fMRI responses  \u2013 . \n\nOur finding of a singular activation site stands in contrast to the extended temporo-parieto-premotor circuit that has been described in a recent fMRI study   as activated during listening to everyday manual action-related sounds. But at a lower statistical threshold we found effects in a more widespread temporo-frontal network that included the right middle temporal gyrus, as also found by Gazzola and colleagues  . The differences between the cortical network in our vs. Gazzola et al's study (e.g. the involvement of posterior parietal areas in the latter) might in part be due to different responses to simple everyday action sounds, such as ripping a sheet of paper, than to sounds associated with finger movement sequences such as those required for playing the piano melodies in our study. Additionally, the sound-action associations investigated by Gazzola et al.   were established over long periods \u2013 months to years - before the experiment. The activation of the anterior insula observed in our study may therefore represent an early stage of auditory-motor learning, which may be later consolidated into a different network more similar to the one identified by Gazzola and co-workers  . \n\nThe idea that long-term training for the paradigm used in our study would induce other changes than those seen after a single, short training session is also supported by two studies that have used similar melody learning paradigms and have tracked the ensuing brain response differences over multiple training sessions  ,  . In the following we will however mainly focus the discussion on the effects that were reported after the first training session. \n\nBangert and colleagues   have investigated cortical activation patterns using DC-EEG-recordings obtained in subjects who passively listened to a musical piece before and after subjects learned to play the melody on the piano with their right hand. The scalp topography of slow DC-potential changes evoked by passively listening to the musical piece was recorded from 30 electrode positions. Two groups were investigated: one using a piano with a conventional key-to-pitch assignment (as in our study), and one group with a random assignment. Differences in slow EEG potentials were found before and after the first training session that were particularly wide-spread in the subject group with conventional key-to-pitch assignment. How do these results compare with the fMRI activations that we observed in the present study? With regard to the anterior insular activation, it is difficult to predict whether and how neuronal activity in this region would show up in scalp surface EEG recordings. Generally, there is good evidence that deep cortical sources can contribute to the scalp EEG (cf. the cingulate motor area sources  ). Source reconstruction results also suggest the principal existence of significant insular contributions to the EEG recorded from the surface of the scalp  ,  . Although the exact generator sites of the scalp potentials reported by Bangert and co-workers   can not be determined by visual inspection of the reported data, it is in view of the preceding considerations possible that some of the EEG changes observed in this study might have originated in the insular cortex. The wide-spread topography of the reported EEG changes, together with the multiple frontal and temporal fMRI activation sites we have obtained in our study at a low statistical threshold, indicate that a rather widespread cortical network is additionally activated by listening to a rehearsed as compared with an unrehearsed piece. Further investigations will be needed to delineate this network and the function of its nodes more thoroughly. \n\nIn a second study employing a melody learning paradigm, D'Ausilio and colleagues   evaluated motor cortical excitability using TMS during passive listening to piano melodies that were previously rehearsed compared with control melodies. They found increased motor cortical excitability for the rehearsed but not for the unrehearsed pieces. Specifically, they found increased intracortical facilitation (ICF) after the first learning session, and increased ICF and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after long-term training. These findings give additional support to the view that auditory-motor co-activations might be induced by a single short training session. However, one may ask how these TMS findings may be reconciled with the fact that neither the fMRI results of our study nor those of Gazzola and co-workers   showed primary motor cortex activation when subjects listened to action-related sounds. Interestingly, similar discrepancies also exist for everyday manual action sounds that elicited TMS effects   but no primary motor fMRI effects   and also for action observation in the visual domain: visual observation of natural hand movements modulates MEPs recorded from hand muscles  . An involvement of the primary motor cortex (M1) in visual action observation was also indicated by source reconstruction of magneto-encephalographic data  . In contrast, no M1 activation was found in several PET   and fMRI  \u2013  studies on visual action observation. An explanation for these differences could be sensitivity differences between the methods used, i. e. weak functional effects might already be evident when applying TMS but not show up in fMRI. In this context it is also interesting to note that in our study primary sensorimotor cortex activation, but not anterior insular cortex activation, was correlated with the tendency of the subjects to imagine hand movement during listening to the actively learned melodies. Therefore, between-study differences in the subjects' tendency to movement imagination may be an additional cause for whether or not primary motor cortex involvement is found in different studies. \n\nIn addition to movement imagination, another potential confounding factor for the type of study we have performed are differences in familiarity between the actively and passively learned melodies. In the studies by Bangert et al.   and D'Ausilio et al.   the subjects' familiarity with the different melodies used as stimuli was not evaluated. In the present study, we have assessed familiarity using a melody-variation detection task ( ). A correlation analysis with the individual familiarity differences between actively and passively learned melodies showed correlations in multiple frontal and parietal regions, in particular in Broca's area (BA 45). Importantly, even at low statistical threshold, no correlation was observed in the insular cortex. The same was true for additional correlations with the number of learning trials needed by the subjects to reach the learning criterion and with the subjects' tendency to movement imagination. The primary visual cortex activation correlation found in the later case might be related to the fact that subjects' ratings regarding the mode of movement imagination were predominantly visual. Our results lend therefore little support to the possibility that familiarity differences, speed of learning, or movement imagination made a major contribution to the increased fMRI responses that we found in the insular cortex. \n\nThese responses in the insula overlapped with the insular sensorimotor hand area as determined by a meta-analysis of previous functional imaging studies  \u2013 . It is thus possible that the re-activation of movement representations acquired during the preceding training session may be a mechanism underlying the effects we have observed in the anterior insula, i. e. that these effects represent a \u2018mirror property\u2019 of the insular cortex. The left anterior insula contains a somatotopic motor map that includes representations of finger, shoulder, and leg movement  , and has a role in speech production  . Furthermore, the anterior insula has been found to be active during imagery of standing and walking  , and has been reported to be involved in the \u2018sense of agency\u2019 of hand movement  , that is, the experience of oneself being the cause of an action, which is a fundamental aspect of action representation. Additionally, hand-movement related regional cerebral blood flow changes have also been found in the fronto-opercular cortex  . Whether our findings have any relation to the auditory \u2018mirror neurons\u2019 as described in macaque premotor cortex that respond to both action execution and to listening to the sounds related to the same action   remains to be determined. \n\nThe present study is a first step toward delineating the exact brain areas involved in short-time auditory-motor learning. Several perspectives for further investigations on auditory-motor learning arise from the present study: One would be to repeat the present experiments with the left hand, or a similar experiment with different body parts, in order to determine lateralization and somatotopy of the ensuing effects. Such experiments could provide more evidence for the postulated relation to learned movement representations. A further perspective is to use functional imaging for investigating the neuronal basis of auditory-motor learning over longer periods of time and in relation to that of classical motor learning, where specific changes occur on time scales ranging from minutes to years  ,  . \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 1800344, "text_md5": "06dbf68d74c85928634e6f942fda1387", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 125], "journal": [126, 134], "publication_year": [136, 140], "title": [151, 214], "keywords": [228, 228], "abstract": [241, 2101], "body": [2110, 34001]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 17327919, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0000259", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1800344", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=1800344"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1800344\">1800344</a>", "list_title": "PMC1800344  A Rapid Sound-Action Association Effect in Human Insular Cortex"}

From a neuroscience perspective, choice emanates from a dynamic multicomponential process. Recent technological advances in neuroimaging have made it possible for researchers to separately visualize perceptual input, intermediate processing, and motor output. An affective neuroscience account of financial risk taking thus might illuminate affective mediators that bridge the gap between statistical input and choice output. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis (via activation likelihood estimate or ALE) of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments that focused on neural responses to financial options with varying statistical moments (i.e., mean, variance, skewness). Results suggested that different statistical moments elicit both common and distinct patterns of neural activity. Across studies, high versus low mean had the highest probability of increasing ventral striatal activity, but high versus low variance had the highest probability of increasing anterior insula activity. Further, high versus low skewness had the highest probability of increasing ventral striatal activity. Since ventral striatal activity has been associated with positive aroused affect (e.g., excitement), whereas anterior insular activity has been associated with negative aroused affect (e.g., anxiety) or general arousal, these findings are consistent with the notion that statistical input influences choice output by eliciting anticipatory affect. The findings also imply that neural activity can be used to predict financial risk taking \u2013 both when it conforms to and violates traditional models of choice. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nImagine a world where people act as computers, consistently taking in, analyzing, and responding to all of their sensory impressions. These \u201crational\u201d actors should not show volatile and inconsistent changes in preferences, and so their future choices should be predictable based on their past behavior. Such a world may be hard to imagine, because it is not the world we live in. Instead, people often show sudden, pronounced, and inconsistent changes in choice. For instance, although most people will never win the lottery or lose a limb, the same individuals will often pay a high premium both for a tiny chance to hit the jackpot as well as to compensate for the unlikely possibility of dismemberment. To explain financial risk taking, decision theorists have either appealed to the objective statistical properties of financial options or to the subjective emotional experience of individuals. Do these distinct accounts conflict with or complement each other, and can they be reconciled? \n\n### Economic and finance models of risk taking \n  \nTraditional economic models assume that people seek to maximize value. Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat historically concluded that the expected value of uncertain gambles could be calculated by multiplying the magnitude of the gamble outcomes by their probability. Thus, they mathematically defined \u201cexpected value\u201d as the mean (or the first statistical moment) of repeated outcomes. In economics,   expected value   (and its close cousin   expected utility  ) provide a foundational guide to choice by providing a common metric that individuals can use to compare different and diverse financial options (von Neumann and Morgenstern,  ). One implication of preferences for expected value is that people should not only prefer gambles with the best outcomes, but also those with more chances to obtain a good outcome. Beyond expected value, financial theorists have additionally and separately considered the role of risk, which can be mathematically defined as variance (or the second statistical moment) of repeated outcomes (Markowitz,  ). Resulting   mean-variance   financial models further assume that while people are attracted to expected value, they are instead repelled by risk. One implication of preferences against risk is that people should prefer gambles with relatively steady outcomes over those with more variable outcomes. \n\nBehavioral research, however, suggests that neither expected value nor mean-variance models fully account for individuals\u2019 financial risk taking (Edwards,  ). As a result, some theorists have suggested that anomalies in choice (e.g., the lack of diversity in investors\u2019 portfolios) might result from preferences for large yet improbable outcomes, which has been mathematically defined as skewness (or the third statistical moment; Mitton and Vorkink,  ). One implication of preferences for skewness (according to some theories) is that people might prefer \u201clong shot\u201d gambles (e.g., those with high magnitude but low probability outcomes) over others. Despite some behavioral evidence that skewness can influence preferences (Kraus and Litzenberger,  ; Coombs and Lehner,  ), either by enhancing (Menezes et al.,  ) or interacting with risk (Alderfer and Bierman,  ; Chiu,  ), only a few models of financial risk taking consider skewness. For instance, cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman,  ) and rank-dependent utility models (Quiggin,  ) have attempted to account for skewness by overweighting large but unlikely positive and negative outcomes. In doing so, however, these models sacrifice their ability to explain tolerance for variance (Levy and Levy,  ). Although most economic theories do not account for the influence of skewed outcomes, skewed outcomes may nonetheless influence choice, at both the individual and the market levels (Patton,  ). Thus, while traditional economic and finance theories consider the influence of mean and variance on risky choice, most remain agnostic about the influence of higher order statistical moments such as skewness. By implication, a theory that accounts for individuals\u2019 preferences for skewness in addition to mean and variance might generate more accurate predictions about risky financial choice. \n\n\n### Emotion and risky choice \n  \nIf people base risky financial choices solely on statistics (e.g., mean, variance, skewness), then all individuals should show similar choices, generating predictable market movements. Psychological theorists, however, have argued that financial choices likely result from multicomponential processes that generate heterogeneous choices. If multicomponential processes drive financial risk taking, then those processes may unfold over time and be influenced by factors other than statistical moments. \n\nEarly economic theorists suspected that emotions influence choice. Smith ( ) argued that behavior was determined by a struggle between the \u201cpassions\u201d and an \u201cimpartial spectator.\u201d The passions included emotions such as fear and anger, as well as motivational feeling states arising from self- or other-regarding interests. Smith argued that although behavior may be influenced by passions, individuals can overcome their impulses by observing their actions from the perspective of an \u201cimpartial\u201d outsider. Due to a subsequent emphasis on rational decision-making (partly encouraged by von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s work on expected value), interest in the influence of the passions diminished. \n\nMore recently, although traditional economic theorists have endorsed the rationally grounded \u201cEfficient Markets Hypothesis\u201d (Samuelson,  ; Fama,  ), unpredicted and rapid rises and crashes of the market valuation of technology and housing sectors have raised new questions about investor rationality. Critics of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis have contended that investors consistently exhibit irrational tendencies including overconfidence (Barber and Odean,  ; Gervais and Odean,  ), loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky,  ; Shefrin and Statman,  ; Odean,  ), herding (Huberman and Regev,  ), psychological accounting (Tversky and Kahneman,  ), miscalculation of probabilities (Lichtenstein et al.,  ), and regret (Bell,  ; Clarke et al.,  ). These \u201cirrational\u201d biases have been attributed to psychological factors with emotional overtones \u2013 including fear, greed, and other affective reactions to price fluctuations and shocks to wealth. In an attempt to explain individual and market anomalies, an expanding field of research has begun to examine links between emotion and \u201cirrational\u201d decision-making (Loewenstein,  ). \n\nBeyond the notion that emotion acts peripherally to undermine choice, some theorists have proposed that affect can play an even more central role by providing a \u201ccommon currency\u201d that allows individuals to compare and choose between different options (Peters et al.,  ). Despite the difficulty of measuring affect, scientists have had some success by examining associations between different affective reactions and choice (Mellers,  ). Although most of this research has focused on \u201cconsequential\u201d affect, which arises in response to choice outcomes, some have additionally argued for the importance of \u201canticipatory\u201d affect, which occurs   prior   to choice (Loewenstein et al.,  ). \n\nTo assess affect, behavioral researchers have primarily relied upon self-reported experience. For instance, investigators can compare a single individual\u2019s affective reactions to different stimuli (e.g., gambles) in two dimensions (e.g., valence on a continuum from bad to good, and arousal on a continuum from not aroused to aroused). Valence and arousal ratings can then be mean-deviated across stimuli within an individual and mathematically rotated through affect space (by 45\u00b0) to derive indices of positive and negative arousal (Knutson et al.,  ). Using these and related methods, investigators have shown that anticipation of uncertain monetary gains elicits positive arousal, whereas anticipation of uncertain monetary losses elicits negative arousal \u2013 even before outcomes are revealed, and when measured either online during anticipation or retrospectively (Samanez-Larkin et al.,  ; Nielsen et al.,  ). \n\nSince anticipation of uncertain gains or losses elicits self-reported affect, this might subsequently influence risky choice. Unfortunately, anticipatory affect is difficult to assess because most affective self-reports are retrospective (and thus prone to memory and other biases) and online probes of affect may change the very nature of the choice being made (e.g., introducing reflection, distraction, delays, and other biases into the decision process). Ideally, investigators could also collect online physiological probes of anticipatory affect in order to validate and augment self-report measures. Fortunately, advances in neuroimaging at the end of the twentieth century may provide these probes. \n\n\n### Neural targets \n  \nIn initial attempts to link physiological measures of affect to financial risk taking, researchers collected peripheral physiological measures (including skin conductance, blood volume pulse, heart rate, muscular tone, respiration, and body temperature) from financial traders at work. The investigators observed increased physiological reactions during periods of market volatility, and reported greater increased physiological reactions to market volatility in less experienced traders (Lo and Repin,  ). Subsequent findings suggested that the strength of physiological reactions correlated with poor trading performance (Lo et al.,  ). Contrary to the notion that emotions play no role in financial risk taking, these findings suggested that market events correlated with both self-reported and physiological reactions, even in experienced professional traders. The correlational nature of these findings, however, could not establish whether financial events caused the arousal, or whether arousal might reciprocally influence financial choice. \n\nAdvances in the temporal and spatial resolution of neuroimaging techniques (such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or FMRI) have enabled researchers to visualize changes in brain activity as individuals anticipate and make financial choices. Critically, these advances allow investigators to examine changes in neural activity in anticipation of choice. Thus, investigators can temporally capture neural responses to statistical properties of financial options before outcomes are revealed. Enhanced temporal resolution also raises the possibility of using anticipatory neural activity to predict choice. Advances in spatial resolution also matter, since FMRI allows investigators to probe activity in deep subcortical as well as cortical circuits. Based on evolutionary reasoning, while more recently evolved cortical circuits may play critical roles in the representation of language and numeric symbols, more ancient subcortical circuits that share greater homology across mammalian species may play a more prominent role in emotional and motivational functions that can promote immediate survival (MacLean,  ). Specifically, decades of brain stimulation in animals suggest that animals will work to the exclusion of all other rewards to stimulate subcortical regions that lie along the ascending mesolimbic dopamine pathway, extending from the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain through the lateral hypothalamus to ventral striatal regions (including the nucleus accumbens or NAcc) and medial and orbital prefrontal cortices (MPFC; Olds and Fobes,  ). In contrast, animals will work equally hard to avoid stimulating other subcortical pathways that extend from the periaqueductal gray of the midbrain up through the stria terminalis and the medial hypothalamus to the lateral amygdala, and possibly the anterior insula (Panksepp,  ). Based on its subcortical spatial resolution, FMRI could allow investigators to test for the involvement of affect not only in choices linked to immediate survival, but also more abstract choices related to financial risk taking. \n\nTo link activity in these deep brain circuits to affective experience and ultimately choice, we have outlined an anticipatory affect model (Knutson and Greer,  ). The model posits that uncertainty elicits increased aroused affect, while potential gains versus losses elicit positive versus negative affect. Since most future events are subjectively uncertain, potential gains should elicit positive arousal (e.g., feelings like excitement) as well as correlated neural activity in the NAcc, but potential losses should elicit negative arousal (e.g., feelings like anxiety) as well as correlated neural activity in the anterior insula. The anticipatory affect model has additional implications for motivated behavior, since the evolved function of positive arousal is to promote approach, whereas the function of negative arousal is to promote avoidance (Figure  ). \n  \n An anticipatory affect model (adapted from Knutson and Greer,  )  . An incentive cue for uncertain future outcome first elicits brain activation in at least two brain regions (NAcc and anterior insula) associated with anticipatory affect (positive arousal and negative arousal, respectively). The balance of activation in related circuits then promotes either approach toward or avoidance of risk. \n  \nMost risky financial propositions (e.g., gambles, stocks) require concurrent assessment of uncertain gains and uncertain losses. According to the anticipatory affect model, if positive arousal increases, uncertain gains should appear more prominent, which should lead people to approach the risk (all else being equal). On the other hand, if negative arousal increases, uncertain losses should appear more prominent, which should lead people to avoid the risk. Consistent with this account, in an initial FMRI study that used neural activity to predict financial risk taking, anticipatory NAcc activity predicted increased financial risk taking, whereas anticipatory anterior insula activity predicted decreased financial risk taking (Kuhnen and Knutson,  ). \n\nAlthough initially inspired by a combination of animal brain stimulation (Panksepp,  ) and human neuroimaging findings, the anticipatory affect model shares features with earlier \u201csomatic marker\u201d and \u201crisk as feelings\u201d models, both of which posit that anticipation of uncertain outcomes can generate emotional arousal (Bechara et al.,  ; Loewenstein et al.,  ). Critically, however, the anticipatory affect model does not require mediation through bodily sensations (i.e., requiring only brain activity, unlike somatic marker accounts), and specifically distinguishes anticipatory positive arousal from negative arousal (which have opposite effects on subsequent approach versus avoidance behavior, unlike the risk as feelings model). Finally, the anticipatory affect model links positive and negative arousal to activity in distinguishable neural circuits, implying that neuroimaging data could be used to directionally predict risky choice (e.g., Kuhnen and Knutson,  ). \n\nDifferent statistical moments of financial options might influence either the same or different neural circuits. The anticipatory affect model implies that distinct statistical moments should exert different but overlapping influences on affect and associated neural activity. First, financial options with high means involve large potential gains, and so should elicit positive arousal and correlated NAcc activity. Second, financial options with high variance involve both large potential losses and gains, which should elicit negative arousal and correlated anterior insula activity as well as positive arousal and correlated NAcc activity. Third, financial options with high (overall) skewness involve even larger potential losses and gains, which should elicit even more negative arousal and correlated anterior insula activity, as well as positive arousal, and correlated NAcc activity. However, positive skewness and negative skewness might have divergent impacts, since options with high positive skewness involve large potential gains, which should elicit positive arousal and correlated NAcc activity, while options with high negative skewness involve large potential losses, which should elicit negative arousal and correlated anterior insula activity. By implication, since anticipatory affective circuits are especially sensitive to the best or worst potential outcomes, they may de-emphasize probability and other considerations that require simulation or integration of many potential outcomes over time (and which may rely more on prefrontal circuits such as the MPFC). \n\nConsistent with the anticipatory affect model, previous self-reported affect findings suggest that anticipating the outcomes of higher mean gambles elicits greater positive arousal (Knutson et al.,  ). Anticipating the outcomes of higher variance gambles (with equal mean) elicits both greater negative arousal and positive arousal. Additionally, anticipating the outcomes of positively skewed gambles (with equal mean and variance) elicits greater positive arousal, whereas anticipating the outcomes of negatively skewed gambles (with equal mean and variance) elicits greater negative arousal (Figure  ; Wu et al.,  ). But beyond self-reported affect, do patterns of neural activity also align with the anticipatory affect model? Since a number of recent studies have investigated the impact of financial statistical moments on FMRI activity, we now survey their collected findings. \n  \n Negative and positive arousal ratings by gamble variance and skewness (adapted from Wu et al.,  )  . Expected value was held constant across all four gambles, while variance was equated across High Variance, Negative Skew, and Positive Skew gambles, and skewness was manipulated in opposite directions for Positive- versus Negative Skew gambles. Gambles elicited differential positive arousal such that Positive Skew\u2009>\u2009High Variance and Negative Skew\u2009>\u2009Low Variance (all   p  \u2019s\u2009<\u20090.05). Gambles elicited differential negative arousal such that Negative Skew\u2009>\u2009High Variance and Positive Skew\u2009>\u2009Low Variance (all   p  \u2019s\u2009<\u20090.05). \n  \n\n### Present aims \n  \nAlthough earlier reviews have considered how financial risk influences neural activity (Knutson and Bossaerts,  ; Mohr et al.,  ), none have integrated both economic and psychological accounts by explicitly linking different statistical moments of financial options to neural responses. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine whether different statistical moments of financial options (i.e., mean, variance, and skewness) recruit distinct or overlapping neural circuits implicated in anticipatory affect, and to explore implications of these findings for subsequent choice. To address these aims, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of FMRI studies of statistical moments on financial risk using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Based on the anticipatory affect model, we predicted that distinct statistical moments would elicit overlapping patterns of activation, such that moments involving large gains (high mean, high variance, positive skewness) should increase activity in the ventral striatum (including the NAcc), and moments involving large losses (high variance, negative skewness) should increase activity in the anterior insula. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nWe reviewed FMRI studies of financial risk taking. Studies were identified for meta-analysis via a search of the PubMed database using key phrases \u201cmean\u201d OR \u201creward\u201d OR \u201cexpected value\u201d OR \u201cvariance\u201d OR \u201crisk\u201d OR \u201cuncertainty\u201d OR \u201cskewness\u201d AND \u201cfinance\u201d OR \u201cmonetary\u201d AND \u201chuman\u201d AND \u201cFMRI.\u201d This search (performed on July 10, 2012) identified 248 studies. We specifically searched for FMRI studies that used monetary incentives to manipulate one or more of the first three statistical moments of interest (i.e., mean, variance, skewness). We further identified recent review papers about risky choice that explicitly addressed neural correlates of financial risk taking (Knutson and Bossaerts,  ; Mohr et al.,  ). All studies found through the database search or cited by the review papers underwent a selection process. Inclusion criteria were: (1) assessment of healthy young adults (i.e., between 18 and 60\u2009years); (2) acquisition of whole brain FMRI data; (3) availability of peak activation coordinates from group activation tables; (4) information about the probability of uncertain outcomes was provided to participants (as opposed to ambiguity); (5) at least one of the three statistical moments of interest (i.e., mean, variance, or skewness) were objectively manipulated, independent of subjective interpretations (i.e., risk tolerance/aversion measures). \n\nThese inclusion criteria were chosen to ensure that results would generalize to the population of healthy young adult humans. Several studies suggest that aging may alter brain structure and function (Cabeza et al.,  ). Furthermore, older adults often show qualitatively different activation patterns than young adults (Park et al.,  ). Therefore, this meta-analysis focused on studies that investigated risk processing in younger healthy adults (Criterion 1). Because some studies focus on specific brain regions, they may not report whole brain results. Partial findings, however, impede the detection of unexpected activations in unscanned or unreported brain regions, so studies were excluded if they acquired or reported only partial brain data (Criterion 2). As the ALE approach requires activation foci, only studies that reported peak activation coordinates of group statistical maps were included (Criterion 3). Because risk is often conceptually distinguished from ambiguity \u2013 a form of uncertainty in which probabilities are unknown \u2013 only studies in which probabilities were known or estimated by subjects were included (Criterion 4). Since the focus of this meta-analysis was to examine neural responses to statistical moments of uncertain financial options, only studies that systematically varied mean, variance, and/or skewness (as opposed to linear probability) of monetary incentives were included (Criterion 5). Studies evaluated for variance and skewness were only included if lower order moments (e.g., mean, mean and variance) were held constant. If studies manipulated multiple moments simultaneously, the lowest appropriate manipulated moment was included in the meta-analysis (e.g., studies that manipulated variance without controlling for mean were included only for mean). \n\nActivation maps were constructed for three distinct contrasts. For the mean map, we included contrasts of neural activity during processing of monetary incentives with high versus low mean. For the variance map, we included contrasts of neural activity during processing of monetary incentives with high versus low variance (but which controlled for mean). For the skewness map, we included contrasts of neural activity during processing of monetary incentives with high (either positive or negative) versus low skewness (but which controlled for variance and mean). \n\nActivation foci coordinates for contrasts in the 28 studies that met inclusion criteria were submitted to ALE meta-analyses (Table  ). Of these, 21 contrasts were included in the mean map, 10 in the variance map, and 4 in the skewness map. Three studies that separately modeled mean and variance were included in both maps, and 2 studies that separately modeled variance and skewness were included in both maps. Yacubian et al. ( ) replicated their results in a second sample, thus their replication findings were separately included in the mean map. Symmonds et al. ( ) separately modeled positive skewness and negative skewness in different whole brain analyses, so these results were separately included in the skewness map. \n  \n Studies included in the ALE meta-analysis, with associated contrasts  . \n    \n\n### Activation likelihood estimate rationale \n  \nIn contrast to behavioral meta-analyses that aim to estimate the effect size of a finding, FMRI meta-analyses aim to identify brain regions, or circuits implicated in certain mental processes (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Due to this difference in research goals, meta-analytic techniques have been adapted to fit the format of FMRI findings. Specifically, whereas the key results of behavioral studies are test statistics (  p  ,   t  , or   z   scores) and effect sizes, test statistics in FMRI studies usually only have meaning when paired together with the information about the location of the effect, often revealed by the location of voxels with the highest test statistics. One frequently used meta-analytic technique that utilizes this spatial information is ALE analysis (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). ALE analysis is a quantitative meta-analytic technique that compares activation likelihoods calculated from a group of observed activation foci with a null distribution of randomly generated activation foci. The ALE meta-analytic method provides advantages over traditional label-based meta-analytic methods because it relies upon activation foci coordinates, which show greater reliability across FMRI studies than do anatomical labels. \n\nMeta-analyses were conducted using the ALE algorithm implemented with Ginger ALE software available from   (Laird et al.,  ). Foci originally reported in Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates were converted to Talairach coordinates using the icbm2tal transformation prior to analysis (Lancaster et al.,  ). In the ALE analyses, each contrast\u2019s activation foci are modeled as the peaks of Gaussian functions, the spatial extent of which is dependent on the number of subjects included in the corresponding analysis. The resulting distributions of values (called \u201cactivation likelihood estimates\u201d) represent the probability of activation occurring in a given voxel (i.e., the ALE values). For the whole brain ALE values, significance was assessed against 5000 sets of randomly distributed foci with a non-parametric statistical permutation test. Statistically thresholded maps were then computed using a false discovery rate procedure that corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain [FDR (  q  )\u2009=\u20090.01, minimum cluster size\u2009=\u2009100\u2009mm ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe contrast of neural responses to high versus low mean (studies\u2009=\u200921, foci\u2009=\u2009210, subjects\u2009=\u2009407) had the highest probability of activating foci in the bilateral NAcc of the ventral striatum. Highly significant foci were also observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, followed by the bilateral anterior insula. Other significant foci were observed in the left red nucleus, thalamus, and putamen (Table  ; Figure  ). \n  \n ALE of neural foci implicated in processing high versus low mean, variance, and skewness  . \n  \n (In Talairach space,   x  \u2009=\u2009right-left;   y  \u2009=\u2009anterior-posterior, and   z  \u2009=\u2009superior-inferior coordinates; predicted peak foci in   bold  )  . \n    \n Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) meta-analytic maps for high versus low mean, variance, and skewness  .

Significant foci were also observed in the left superior temporal sulcus, left medial prefrontal cortex, right ventral striatum, and right anterior insula. \n\nThe contrast of neural responses to high versus low general skewness (studies\u2009=\u20094, foci\u2009=\u200923, subjects\u2009=\u200992) had the highest probability of activating foci in the left NAcc of the ventral striatum. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis aimed to determine whether distinct statistical moments of risky financial options (i.e., mean, variance, skewness) elicit different patterns of neural activity. Rather than recruiting either the same or completely distinct circuits, statistical moments activated overlapping circuits implicated in anticipatory affect. Specifically, statistical moments that promised large gains (i.e., high mean, high variance, high skewness) maximally activated the ventral striatum (particularly in the NAcc), whereas moments that threatened large losses (i.e., high variance) maximally activated the anterior insula. The deep subcortical localization of these circuits is noteworthy (as opposed to neocortical structures implicated in symbolic representation and working memory), as it implies that affective rather than cognitive processes play a critical role in financial risk assessment. \n\nMost of the findings were consistent with the anticipatory affect model. Specifically, high versus low mean maximally activated ventral striatum (including the NAcc), high versus low variance maximally activated the anterior insula (and secondarily the ventral striatum), and high versus low skew maximally activated the ventral striatum. However, high versus low mean also activated the anterior insula to a lesser extent. This may be due to the fact that while most studies of higher order moments (e.g., variance and skewness) controlled for lower order moments (e.g., mean), studies of lower order moments typically did not control for higher order moments. Because increasing lower order moments (e.g., mean) often also increases higher order moments (e.g., variance), studies of lower order moments may inadvertently elicit activity related to higher order moments. Reduced control of higher order moments in studies of lower order moments might also account for the larger overall number of activation foci observed in the high versus low mean contrast. \n\nFindings for skewness partially conformed to the anticipatory affect model. While general skewness activated ventral striatum (including the NAcc), as predicted, common activation of the anterior insula was not as apparent. The omission is unexpected given that all three surveyed studies of skewness have reported that skewed gambles tend to activate the anterior insula (Burke and Tobler,  ; Symmonds et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ). The small number of relevant studies and variability of activation foci in the anterior insula may have precluded a common finding. The anticipatory affect model also specifically predicts that positively skewed gambles will more powerfully activate the ventral striatum, as was found in one study (Wu et al.,  ). However, this prediction could not be evaluated in the context of the meta-analysis because all studies did not provide contrasts for positive versus negative skewness, though this represents an important direction for future research. Finally, some studies modeled statistical moments during the uncertain anticipatory period before gambles were evaluated, whereas others modeled the entire gambling episode from anticipation to outcome. Since the anticipatory affect model is most relevant to the uncertain anticipatory period, it might best predict neural activity that occurs then. \n\n### Integrating anticipatory affect and financial risk taking \n  \nThe meta-analytic findings support neither monolithic nor modular views of neural responses to the statistical moments of financial options. Specifically, ascending from mean (lower order) to skewness (higher order moments) neither repeatedly activates all the same regions, nor does it recruit wholly distinct regions at each step. Thus, ordering the findings by objective statistical properties of the options does not yield a coherent framework for predicting associated neural activity (Table  ). \n  \n Predicted maximum activity organized by statistical moments (lower to higher order)  . \n  \nAlignment by affective impact, however, reconfigures the statistical moments in a coherent way that generates more consistent predictions about associated neural activity (Table  ). Specifically, financial options that involve uncertain large gains are likely to elicit positive arousal (e.g., high mean, positive skewness) and recruit NAcc activity, but financial options that involve uncertain large losses are likely to elicit negative arousal (e.g., high variance, negative skewness) and recruit anterior insula activity. Reordering these statistical moments by affective impact thus scaffolds a more parsimonious and coherent framework for predicting choice. Thus, statistical moments representing objective financial risk may be translated into subjective feelings of risk indexed by neural circuits associated with affect, which together promote choice. Of course, statistical moments may also influence choice through other neural routes as well. For instance, statistical information might recruit circuits involved in symbolic representation and working memory for numerical computation (e.g., dorsolateral and parietal cortices), or might activate circuits implicated in following habits or rules (e.g., the dorsal striatum and premotor cortex). The current analysis, however, suggests that an affective neuroscience account may provide an initial viable framework both for describing and predicting financial risk taking. \n  \n Predicted maximum activity organized by affective impact  . \n  \n\n### Implications for financial choice \n  \nWhile traditional economic (e.g., expected value) and finance (e.g., mean-variance) models can account for a range of choices, other choices elude these models\u2019 explanatory reach. For instance, individual choices may be influenced by higher order statistical moments (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) as well as by incidental factors that are not relevant to the choice at hand (e.g., news, weather, nutrition, sleep, etc.). By both encompassing and transcending the explanatory reach of traditional models, an affective neuroscience approach may eventually offer a more comprehensive account of financial risk taking. \n\nAlthough this meta-analysis focused on the influence of financial options on neural activity, the anticipatory affect account also has implications for choice. Indeed, neuroimaging evidence suggests that while ventral striatal activity (and NAcc activity in particular) predicts risk seeking stock choices, anterior insula activity instead predicts risk avoidant bond choices in investment tasks (Kuhnen and Knutson,  ). Extended to higher order statistical moments, individual differences in NAcc activation as well as positive arousal predict subsequent preferences for positively skewed gambles (Wu et al.,  ). These findings suggest that even given the same statistical gambles, individual differences in affective and neural responses may provide finer-grained predictions that describe not only group behavior, but also individual choice. These findings also imply the novel prediction that even after holding mean and variance constant, ventral striatal (NAcc) activity should predict approach toward positively skewed gambles, while anterior insula activity should predict avoidance of negatively skewed gambles \u2013 a prediction worthy of further investigation. Thus, different types of financial risk (e.g., variance versus skewness, positive versus negative skewness, etc.) may differentially recruit circuits involved in financial risk taking. \n\nAn affective neuroscience account also yields novel predictions about the influence of incidental stimuli on financial risk taking. Specifically, stimuli that increase positive arousal should encourage financial risk taking, whereas stimuli that increase negative arousal might discourage financial risk taking, even when those stimuli are irrelevant to the task at hand. Indeed, in a neuroimaging study of heterosexual males, exposure to positive images (i.e., erotic \u2013 versus neutral office supplies or aversive snakes and spiders) tended to increase choices of higher risk (i.e., higher variance) gambles, and this effect was partially mediated by NAcc activation (Knutson et al.,  ). In a follow-up behavioral study that included males and females, prior presentation of positive images increased financial risk taking, but prior presentation of negative images decreased financial risk taking (Kuhnen and Knutson,  ). \n\nWhile these influences may hold in tightly controlled and carefully incentivized laboratory demonstrations, do they generalize to \u201creal world\u201d choices? Researchers have speculated that investors continue to show biases in choice despite financial advice or knowledge to the contrary. Some of these, such as the lack of diversity in investment portfolios, may result from preferences for skewness (Mitton and Vorkink,  ). Additionally, because individuals are willing to pay more for positively skewed investments but receive more for accepting negatively skewed investments (Ang et al.,  ), skewness preferences may not only describe individual investment choices, but may even scale to market valuation at the aggregate level (Arditti and Levy,  ). \n\nIn summary, to explain human financial risk taking, economists have traditionally referred to objective statistical properties of financial options, while psychologists have emphasized subjective emotional and cognitive processes in the decision maker. An affective neuroscience account bridges these perspectives by proposing that the brain translates statistical input into affective experience, which then can influence choice. Importantly, this affective neuroscience account generates novel yet testable predictions of how various statistical moments might influence choice, and further specifies which neural components should translate statistical input into choice output. The existing findings summarizing neural responses to the first three statistical moments of financial options (i.e., mean, variance, and skewness) lends support to an affective neuroscience approach. Future work using brain activity to predict choice may generate predictions that transcend traditional economic and psychological theories. Ultimately, a better understanding of the neural mechanisms that influence financial risk taking may not only improve individuals\u2019 financial choices, but also societal welfare by better informing public policy. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3487049, "text_md5": "e5bba98e8d37e49e73a3037ca7995f6b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 58], "journal": [59, 73], "publication_year": [75, 79], "title": [90, 155], "keywords": [169, 275], "abstract": [288, 2168], "body": [2177, 40726]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 23129993, "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2012.00159", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487049", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3487049"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487049\">3487049</a>", "list_title": "PMC3487049  Toward an Affective Neuroscience Account of Financial Risk Taking"}

Changes in functional connectivity and structure were respectively assessed with eigenvector centrality mapping complemented by seed-based analysis and with voxel-based morphometry. In addition to mass-univariate statistics, multivariate support vector machine   (   SVM   )   classification tested the potential of multimodal MRI   to differentiate patients and controls  . External validity of SVM was assessed on independent CBS data from the 4RTNI database. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA decrease in brain interconnectedness was observed in the right central operculum, middle temporal gyrus and posterior insula, while widespread connectivity increases were found in the anterior cingulum, medial superior-frontal gyrus and in the bilateral caudate nuclei. Severe and diffuse gray matter volume reduction, especially in the bilateral insula, putamen and thalamus, characterized CBS. SVM classification revealed that both connectivity (area under the curve 0.81) and structural abnormalities (0.80) distinguished CBS from controls, while their combination led to statistically non-significant improvement in discrimination power, questioning the additional value of functional connectivity over atrophy. SVM analyses based on structural MRI generalized moderately well to new data, which was decisively improved when guided by meta-analytically derived disease-specific regions-of-interest. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur data-driven results show impairment of functional connectivity and brain structure in CBS and explore their potential as imaging biomarkers. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCorticobasal syndrome (CBS) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome clinically defined on the basis of motor and non-motor features ( ;  ). Core CBS symptoms, as described in the very first cases reported ( ), are progressive and asymmetrical rigidity and apraxia. These are often associated with cortical manifestations \u2013 such as alien/anarchic limb and cortical sensory impairment \u2013 and with basal ganglia impairment leading to focal dystonia, tremor and bradykinesia ( ;  ). Additionally, recent studies have moved the focus from the classical motor presentation of CBS to cognitive and behavioral symptoms ( ). In particular, impairments in multiple cognitive domains have been described, including executive functions, memory, language, visuo-spatial abilities and social cognition ( ). Of note, the previously neglected cognitive deficits can emerge with, or even precede, motor symptoms ( ;  ;  ). This complex presentation makes the clinical diagnosis of CBS a challenge for physicians. Indeed, different diagnostic criteria for CBS are used across centers ( ). Post-mortem studies have shown that not only corticobasal degeneration \u2013 a tauopathy \u2013, but also several other neuropathological substrates can cause the abovementioned CBS clinical phenotype, thus making the whole picture even more puzzling ( ). For example,   recently reported CBS as one of the possible clinical manifestations in autopsy-confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy ( ). Furthermore, neuropathologically confirmed corticobasal degeneration is in turn linked to different clinical presentations as reported in the diagnostic criteria ( ). \n\nTo increase diagnostic accuracy, recent research focused on searching for novel CBS biomarkers. For example, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has consistently revealed gray matter decreases in patients with CBS compared to healthy controls, encompassing the basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, superior parietal cortex and frontal lobes, as summarized by  . In addition,   in vivo   molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography have identified alterations in glucose metabolism in CBS ( ;  ), as well as evidence of accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid in motor cortex, basal ganglia and corticospinal tract ( ) beside expected tau protein accumulation ( ). \n\nUntil now, very few data have been reported on functional connectivity changes in CBS and a thorough, data-driven investigation is still missing ( ;  ;  ), despite it might provide valuable information ( ). Indeed, CBS, as other neurodegenerative diseases, can be conceptualized as a disconnection syndrome, where the study of functional brain connectivity represents a promising link between clinical phenotypes and underlying neuropathology ( ;  ). \n\nWe believe that the identification of novel multimodal MRI-based diagnostic imaging biomarkers will lead to a better understanding and earlier and more accurate diagnosis of CBS. Therefore, we studied CBS patients and healthy controls combining resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and structural T1-weighted MRI (T1-MRI). To investigate connectivity, we applied data-driven whole-brain analysis \u2013 Eigenvector connectivity mapping (ECM) \u2013 and seed-based analysis. Additionally, we implemented an established multivariate machine learning technique, support vector machine (SVM) classification, to differentiate patients from controls based only on multimodal neuroimaging data ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We hypothesized that CBS, compared to controls, is characterized by widespread cortical atrophy and reductions in brain functional connectivity that can accurately distinguish CBS patients from controls at the single-subject level. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nNineteen CBS patients (age 67.05\u00b16.03 years, mean\u00b1SD; 12 female) and 19 healthy controls (age 66.47\u00b15.99 years; 11 female) were selected ( ). CBS is a rare disorder, the 19 patients were acquired over a timespan of approximately 5 years in several centers across Germany. Each patient was carefully matched with a control subject acquired on the same MRI scanner model, matching also for age and gender. All patients and seven controls were examined at different centers in the context of the German Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) Consortium ( ). Six controls were recruited at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and other six at the Department of Neurology, Charles University of Prague, Czech Republic. Further details on MRI acquisition parameters are displayed in Table e-1. As expected from the sample matching procedure, no significant differences in age (t(36)\u00a0=\u00a00.303,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.7639) or gender distributions (\u03c7 \u00a0=\u00a00.11,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.74) were found between CBS and controls.   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of CBS patients and controls. \n  Table 1     \n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures for amyloid beta 1\u201342, total-tau and phospho-tau were available for 14 out of 19 CBS patients. Mean and dispersion values are reported in supplementary Table e-5. Of note, only one patient showed a CSF pattern suggestive of Alzheimer's disease ( ), i.e. one marker for amyloid pathology (low amyloid-beta 1\u201342) and one for neuronal injury (elevated tau). Another subject presented low amyloid-beta 1\u201342, but normal tau levels. We decided to keep all patients in our study because (1) according to the diagnostic criteria for CBD ( ) there is no specific pattern of these CSF markers related to the disease; (2) according to  , excluding amyloid positive individual might lead to miss about 13% of patients who really have the disease; (3) none of the patients clinically presented features of Alzheimer's dementia. \n\nAll CBS patients were also part of a recent study from our group based on structural MRI ( ). The study was authorized by the local ethics committees of the participating centers, in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent. \n\n\n### MRI protocols and preprocessing \n  \nRs-fMRI (300 vol, TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms; TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms) and structural T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) MRI were acquired on 3 T devices. Table e-1 reports additional information on MRI scanner types that were matched between patients and controls to reduce the variability due to the multicentric nature of the study. Note that matching for individual acquisition parameters was not always possible for all pairs of patients and controls. MRI data were processed using SPM12 (rev.12.6685), FSL (v. 5.0.9) ( ) and Matlab\u2122 9.0 (R2016 a). \n\nRs-fMRI images underwent SPM preprocessing with the following steps: realignment with rigid co-registration of functional volumes to the first one, slice-time correction using as reference the middle slice, and spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space performed via unified segmentation approach that includes bias field correction and segmentation ( ). Further, images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (full-width-half-maximum 8\u00a0mm) to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Nuisance regression was performed including six motion parameters from the SPM realignment, as well as mean intensity signals extracted from the anatomical segmentation of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid based on each subject's T1-MRI. Finally, high-pass filtering (1/80\u00a0Hz) was applied to remove linear baseline drifts and low-frequency noise. Framewise-displacement (FD) ( ) was computed to assess head motion. For each participant, we computed mean FD, maximum FD and maximum FD after disregarding the largest 5% of the FD. We then compared each measure between patients and controls using two-independent sample t-tests and we did not find significant differences (Table e-2). To test the efficacy of the motion correction procedures, FD was re-computed after nuisance regression. All FD measures drastically improved in patients and controls (Figs. e-1 and e-2). \n\nAs for T1-MRI, a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis ( ) was performed with the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT-12). Images were spatially normalized and segmented into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Modulation for the amount of linear and non-linear deformation was performed, followed by smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (full-width-half-maximum 8\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### MRI statistical analysis \n  \n#### MRI group comparisons \n  \n ECM:   ECM is a graph-theory method to investigate interconnectedness in complex networks. This concept is for example implemented by Google in the PageRank algorithm ( ) to rank websites in the search engine output.  ) applied this approach to study brain functional interconnectedness. In brief, a brain region (node) is more important when it has many connections with other prominent nodes that are in turn linked to other heavily connected nodes. Accordingly, ECM is a good measure for the identification of brain functional hubs. We performed whole-brain voxel-wise analysis including a total of 30,110 voxels. The mask for the ECM analysis was created combining the gray matter tissue probability map from SPM (thresholded at 0.2 and smoothed with 8\u00a0mm to obtain an inclusive mask) with the functional data from patients and controls to exclude voxels containing missing values. The LIPSIA software was used for computing ECM ( ). Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) time-courses between voxels can show both positive and, to a minor extent, negative correlations. In our study, we disregarded the negative correlations to satisfy the requirements of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which states that a unique largest eigenvalue can be obtained only for a symmetric and positive similarity matrix ( ). Indeed, methods to deal with negative correlations are inconsistent and their interpretation is complex ( ;  ). As a result of this analysis, a 3\u00a0D map was obtained for each subject, containing voxel-wise EC values. \n\nCBS patients and controls were compared in a two-independent sample   t  -test in SPM. The impact of nuisance covariates on the group comparison (i.e. age, gender and scanner type) was tested via F-tests. Since no significant influence was found, we chose the simplest model excluding nuisance variables. A cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons was applied to identify significant voxels at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 family-wise error (FWE) (cluster-forming threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005,   k  \u00a0=\u00a050). In order to validate the robustness of the results, the t-tests were run using a leave-one-pair out approach, i.e. running the statistical models 19 times while removing one pair of matched patient and control at a time. Finding consistent results across this procedure provides a further validation against possible confounds such as scanner/center variability and head motion. Additionally, in order to overcome the potential pitfalls of cluster-based thresholding ( ), we re-analyzed the comparison of patients and controls using the threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) toolbox in SPM with 5000 permutations, extent   E  \u00a0=\u00a00.6 and statistical significance threshold at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 false discovery rate (FDR). \n\nFinally, an additional ECM analysis was performed using the so-called   neg approach  , i.e. disregarding all positive correlations between BOLD time-courses and computing ECM based on the absolute values of negative correlations. Group comparisons between patients and controls were run as described above also based on these additional ECM maps. \n\n Seed-based analysis  : ECM reveals changes in general brain connectivity (e.g. hubs), but do not highlight selective connectivity changes between specific brain regions. To further explore selective connectivity changes related to the ECM comparison, we performed seed-based analysis with an in-house script running in Matlab. The seeds were placed in the peaks of the significant clusters for the group comparisons CBS>Controls and CBS<Controls based on ECM results. MNI coordinates for the nine seeds are reported in  . BOLD time-courses at the selected coordinates correlated with the time-courses of all other voxels in the brain. This procedure generated, for each subject, a map with voxel-wise correlation coefficients with the seeds. We then tested between-groups differences in a two-sample   t  -test in SPM (CBS vs. Controls,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE at cluster level, voxel-wise cluster-forming threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005,   k  \u00a0=\u00a050). Specifically, increases in connectivity in the CBS groups were investigated from the CBS>Controls seeds and decreases of connectivity from the CBS<Controls ones. To merge together results from different seeds, the output SPM beta-images, i.e. effect size maps, were entered in a one-sample   t  -test to identify the regions where connectivity changes are consistent across the seeds. This procedure was run separately for increases and decreases in connectivity.   \nResults of the eigenvector centrality group comparison. \n  Table 2     \n\n T1-MRI:   Gray matter volume images were compared between patients and controls in a two-independent samples   t  -test, controlling for total intracranial volume, age, gender and scanner type as nuisance covariates. Results were deemed significant using a voxel-wise threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 (  k  \u00a0=\u00a050) and cluster level correction for multiple comparisons   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE. As for resting-state data, the comparison between CBS and controls was additionally performed using the TFCE toolbox (5000 permutations,   E  \u00a0=\u00a00.6) \n\n\n#### Influence of local gray matter volume on connectivity differences \n  \nLeveraging on multimodal MRI data, we performed an additional analysis in order to disentangle the effect of atrophy on eigenvector centrality differences between patients and controls. To this aim, we used the toolbox Biological Parametric Mapping (BPM) from ( ), running in SPM8 and Matlab 7.14. Briefly, the comparison between ECM maps between patients and controls was performed entering gray matter volume images for each subject as covariate in the analysis. In order to bring images from both modalities in the same resolution, voxels in ECM maps were up-scaled to 1.5\u00a0mm . Results were deemed significant using a voxel-wise threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 and cluster level correction for multiple comparisons   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE. \n\n\n#### Correlation analysis \n  \nFor both ECM and VBM data, we analyzed whole-brain correlations between EC values or gray matter volume and standardized measures for disease severity, namely frontotemporal lobar degeneration-clinical dementia rating scale (FTLD-CDR) and mini-mental-state examination (MMSE). Data for MMSE and FTLD-CDR were missing, respectively, for three and two patients. In brief, ECM values and gray matter volume were separately correlated with clinical variables in the CBS group, controlling for differences in age, gender, scanner type and, only for VBM data, total intracranial volume. Significance level was set at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE corrected at the cluster level, with cluster forming threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 (  k  \u00a0=\u00a050). When no significant findings were detected at the whole-brain level, correlation analyses were performed correlating the clinical variables with EC or gray matter volume values extracted from the peak MNI coordinates of the significant clusters in the group comparisons (i.e. ECM or VBM group comparisons). Correlations were assessed by two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05) using FDR correction to account for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### MRI-based support vector machine classification \n  \nIn order to ascertain the disease state from MRI data at the individual level, multimodal SVM classification was performed with PRoNTo v.2.1 ( ). This approach is based on multivariate pattern analysis and it is inherently different from univariate statistics. We investigated the predictive value for separating patients and controls of rs-fMRI (ECM model) and T1-MRI (gray matter volume maps \u2013 VBM model) separately and combined (Combined model). To have the same number of features in structural and functional maps, as required by the PRoNTo v.2.1 software, rs-fMRI data were upscaled to a voxel resolution of 1.5\u00a0mm . Training was performed with a leave-one-out cross-validation. The combination of the two modalities was achieved with \u201csimple Multiple-Kernel Learning\u201d (sMKL) algorithm ( ). This technique computes a single kernel for each modality and then finds their optimal combination, defining their relative importance while maximizing the margin for the classification problem. The significance of the classification accuracy was tested with a 10,000 permutation test. In order to compare if one model would outperform the others, we compared the areas under the curves (AUC) of their respective ROC curves using the non-parametric DeLong test ( ). \n\nTo further test the robustness of the classifier with changes in the cross-validation scheme, the models were re-run using 5-fold cross-validation on subject per group, instead of the leave-one-out approach. The effect of nuisance covariates was further tested. All the three models (ECM, VBM and Combined) were run controlling for either age and gender, or scanner or both, thus creating a total of 9 additional models. Both age and gender were coded using the one-hot encoding strategy to ensure that all values in the covariates are assigned the same importance. \n\nFinally, the external validity of the VBM model was tested on an independent dataset of CBS patients from the 4-Repeat Tauopathy Neuroimaging Initiative (4RTNI,  ). T1-MPRAGE MRI data acquired in different centers at 3 T devices were included for 39 patients (age: 66.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2, mean\u00b1SD, 20 female) diagnosed as probable CBS-CBD subtype ( ). Details on MRI acquisition parameters are described by  ). In brief, T1-MRI data underwent voxel-based morphometry in CAT12 as described for data from the FTLD consortium. The resulting gray matter volume images were than iteratively used as test data for the SVM based on T1-MRI only. For each new subject in the independent test set, we obtained a function value from the SVM and the corresponding class attribution (i.e. CBS patient or control). The analysis was performed either using whole-brain images or restricting feature selection based on meta-analytically derived disease-specific regions of interest (ROIs). We hypothesize that using   a priori   informed ROIs from meta-analyses might improve generalizability of the classification as already shown for several other neurodegenerative diseases ( ;  ;  ;  ). ROIs were created based on MNI coordinates from ( ). For each MNI coordinate, the corresponding and the contralateral regions of the AAL atlas were selected to account for potential differences in lateralization between patients. The mask is graphically sown in   and a list of the AAL regions is reported in supplementary Table e-6. External validation was performed only for T1-MRI data for two reasons: 1) rs-fMRI data from 4RTNI cohort present acquisition parameters very different from those applied in the study, which would lead to systematic differences in the estimated connectivity measures. 2) in our FTLD cohort, rs-fMRI did not significantly improve predictive power in the classification, as shown by statistical comparison with the DeLong test (see Results). \n\n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nClinical and MRI data are available on reasonable request to the corresponding author. To protect anonymity, no sensitive information will be shared.

A similar effect was identified also in the left central operculum and transverse temporal gyrus but did not survive the correction for multiple comparisons. Remarkably, contrary to expectation, CBS patients compared to controls showed increased interconnectedness in frontal brain regions, namely in the medial superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyri, and in the bilateral caudate nuclei ( ,  ). The leave-one-pair-out approach confirmed the results in all comparisons (19/19) (Fig. e-3). Additionally, re-analysis with the TFCE approach revealed ECM changes in CBS patients compared to controls very similar to those observed with cluster-based thresholding (see for details supplementary Fig. e-4).   \nTemporoparietal and insular connectivity decreases in CBS compared to controls.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  Fig. 2   \n\nGroup comparisons of ECM maps based on negative BOLD correlations showed decreased ECM in CBS compared to controls in the bilateral sensorimotor cortex and increases in the middle cingulate gyrus (supplementary Fig. e-6). \n\n Seed-based connectivity:   For the seeds from the CBS<Controls ECM analysis, the CBS group showed markedly reduced functional connectivity from all the three seeds. In particular, the connectivity reduction involved the right insular and temporal cortex surrounding the seeds, their contralateral homologues, as well as cuneus, precuneus, middle cingulate cortex, and bilateral superior parietal cortex ( ). \n\nFour of the six seeds from the CBS>Controls ECM comparison showed significant increases in connectivity in the seed-based analysis. The two other seeds showed similar results that did not survive the FWE correction for multiple comparisons. Altogether, CBS patients compared to controls showed increased connectivity within a fronto-caudate network involving extensively the medial frontal and anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral caudate nuclei, as shown with one-sample   t  -test on the SPM beta-images ( ). \n\n VBM analysis:   The analysis of T1-MRI data revealed pervasive lower gray matter volume in CBS patients as compared to controls, in particular in the bilateral insulae, putamen, thalamus, in the entire cingulate cortex and widespread in cortical regions ( ). Re-analysis with the TFCE toolbox showed widespread gray matter volume loss in CBS compared to controls with a topographical distribution closely resembling the one described for the cluster-based method.   \nGray matter volume reductions in CBS compared to controls and correlation with disease severity.

In addition, the figure displays whole-brain correlations between gray matter volume in the CBS group and standardized measures for disease severity, i.e. FTLD-CDR (red) or MMSE (yellow). The scatterplots display the correlation between test measures and gray matter volume values in the peaks of the significant clusters. The more severe the disease, the less gray matter volume is. Images are displayed in radiological convention: left brain on the right of the image. All results are shown at   p  <0.05 FWE corrected at cluster level.

As for the decrease in EC in CBS<Controls, we observed a trend towards significance (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.076) in the same cluster described in the original analysis that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. A graphical representation is presented in supplementary Fig. e-5. \n\n\n### Correlation analysis \n  \nAs illustrated in  , MMSE and FTLD-CDR showed, respectively, positive and negative correlations in whole-brain VBM data, indicating lower test performance with more severe structural impairment. For MMSE, the correlation was localized in the bilateral exterior cerebellum, temporal poles, middle/superior temporal gyri, and supramarginal gyri. For FTLD-CDR the correlation analysis yielded a large cluster ranging from the right temporal pole to the middle/superior temporal and supramarginal gyri. Of note, results for MMSE and FTLD-CDR were overlapping in two clusters, located in the right temporal pole and in the superior temporal/supramarginal gyri ( ). No whole-brain correlation between clinical measures and ECM maps survived correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nIn addition, EC values in clusters from the ECM CBS>controls group comparisons positively correlated with FTLD-CDR, but not with MMSE. Note here that the FTLD-CDR is generally more sensitive for non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the MMSE was developed for Alzheimer's dementia. Namely, a significant positive correlation was identified in the left caudate nucleus (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.641,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.027 \u2013 FDR corrected \u2013 at MNI \u221218,20,14, which indicates higher caudate interconnectedness associated with a more severe clinical presentation. Moreover, FTLD-CDR scores negatively correlated with EC values in the cluster from the ECM CBS<Controls group comparison (rho\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.634,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.027 \u2013 FDR corrected \u2013 at MNI 54,5,\u22121), suggesting a more severe clinical presentation with lower right temporal/insular interconnectedness ( ).   \nCorrelations between eigenvector centrality changes in CBS and disease severity. Positive and negative Spearman's correlations between FTLD-CDR, as proxy for disease severity, and eigenvector centrality in the significant clusters from the ECM CBS>controls comparison. The more severe the disease, the lower the interconnectedness in the right temporal/insular cortex, and the higher the interconnectedness in left caudate nucleus, suggesting proportional connectivity changes with disease severity and, potentially, brain compensation. MNI coordinates for the clusters are reported on the side of each scatterplot. Dotted lines represent 95% confidence intervals.

Fifteen CBS patients (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.006) and 15 controls (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.007) were correctly classified based only on structural data, thus with an overall balanced accuracy (BA) of 78.95% (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002, area under the curve, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.80). ECM maps distinguished 14 CBS patients (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.026) and 15 controls (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.011), reaching an overall BA of 76.32% (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.81). Combining both modalities via MKL, the overall performance of the classifier increased to 84.21% (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.0001, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.87), correctly recognizing 16 patients (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002) and 16 controls (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.001). However, the nonparametric comparison of AUCs using the DeLong test did not reveal statistically significant differences between the three models. In particular, the combined model did not outperform neither VBM alone (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.24), nor the ECM model (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.34). Complete output of the DeLong test is shown in supplementary Table e-5. Changes in the cross-validation had the following effects on model performance: Moderate decreased performance for the ECM model (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.79, BA\u00a0=\u00a071.05%), increased performance for the VBM model (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.84, BA\u00a0=\u00a084.21%) and no effect on the combined model (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.88, BA\u00a0=\u00a084.21%). Hence, the same pattern was detected: Lowest accuracy in ECM maps, better in VBM maps, best accuracy in combined approach. The effects of covariates are descried in details in the supplementary Table e-3.   \nResults of support vector machine classification based on MRI imaging markers.

In sum, we show that CBS is associated with functional connectivity alterations, including both decreases in right temporo-parietal and insular regions and, remarkably, increases in a frontal network encompassing medial frontal and anterior cingulate cortex, and the bilateral caudate nuclei. Moreover, we identified brain structural abnormalities in the insula, putamen, thalamus and widespread cortical regions. Both T1-MRI and rs-fMRI independently yielded a good discrimination power to distinguish CBS patients from controls, and slightly more when combined in a single model (over 80% balanced accuracy). However, differences between the three models were not statistically significant, hence undermining the additional benefit of including rs-fMRI data for diagnostic purposes. T1-MRI data alone generalized moderately well to independent data from an external cohort. Of note, guiding feature selection with meta-analytically defined disease-specific ROIs improved generalizability. This finding is in agreement with other studies investigating several other neurodegenerative diseases and showing that ROIs defined in independent cohorts by systematic and quantitative meta-analyses can improve classification accuracy for diagnosis and differential diagnosis in imaging data ( ;  ;  ;  ). Concerning rs-fMRI, our multicentric study included, to our knowledge, the largest patient cohort so far. Moreover, the application of data-driven ECM analysis gives an unbiased perspective on brain functional interconnectedness. \n\nWe analyzed whole-brain ECM changes in CBS to avoid any   a priori   assumptions. ECM analysis revealed decreased interconnectedness in right temporo-parietal and posterior insular cortex, as well as increases in frontal cortex and caudate nuclei in CBS. Seed-based analysis showed that decreases in ECM in CBS compared to controls were related to diffuse functional connectivity decline with temporo-parietal associative cortices, middle cingulate cortex and precuneus. In addition, ECM increases were associated with functional connectivity increases in a fronto-caudate network. Consistent with our results,  ) found both decreases and increases in resting-state functional connectivity in CBS compared to controls, using independent component analysis. Specifically, the CBS group showed increased within-network connectivity in regions of the default mode network, in the cerebellum, in the sensorimotor, executive control and insula networks. Between-network connectivity was lower in CBS compared to controls between the lateral visual and auditory networks and higher between salience and executive control networks. A similar investigation from the same research group ( ) applied seed-based analysis to rs-fMRI data from CBS and found, in comparison to controls, decreases and increases in functional connectivity, respectively when placing the seeds in the thalamus or in the dentate nucleus. \n\nIncreases in functional connectivity are a common finding not only in CBS, but also in other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders ( ). The correlation analysis revealed an association between more severe disease presentation (i.e. higher FTLD-CDR scores) and lower eigenvector centrality in the right temporal cortex, as well as increased interconnectedness in left caudate nucleus. This finding suggests a progressive connectivity alteration in CBS and, potentially, a compensatory meaning of the connectivity increases. This assumption might be further supported by the fact that increased connectivity in CBS correlated with FTLD-CDR scores in contrast to atrophy. Decreases in CBS\u2019 brain connectivity instead coincided regionally with atrophy regarding correlation with the FTLD-CDR as measure of disease severity. However, additional explanations are that increases in connectivity might be a sign of pathological changes within these networks or the consequence of distant pathological alterations (so called diaschisis effect). Our findings are in agreement with other studies in Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, where pathological alterations in one network (e.g. the default mode) might lead to aberrant reorganization of anti-correlated networks (e.g. the anterior salience network) ( ).  ), based on the revision of 126 functional connectivity studies, proposed that hyperconnectivity is an essential and frequent response to neurological diseases. Specifically, they propose that increased connectivity has most likely a multifactorial origin, including the role of the impaired brain regions in large-scale networks and the accessibility of local and global connections ( ). \n\nAs for T1-MRI data, our results are consistent with previous studies showing severe and widespread cortical atrophy in CBS ( ), as recently quantitatively summarized in a meta-analysis ( ). Importantly, structural brain changes significantly correlated with both MMSE and FTLD-CDR measures. As expected, more severe gray matter volume reduction, i.e. atrophy, was associated with worse disease severity. Results for the two measures overlapped in two clusters located in the right temporal gyrus and in the superior temporal/supramarginal gyri, indicating these brain regions as hotspots of the disease, although one has to take into account the heterogeneity of both MMSE and FTLD-CDR measures (assessing cognitive, behavioral and functional symptoms). \n\nThe interrelationship between structural and functional brain changes is a general question, when exploring functional networks in neurodegeneration and here we addressed it using Biological Parametric Mapping ( ). Of note, our results show that local atrophy, although severe and widespread, does not have a significant impact on the described eigenvector centrality alterations in CBS. \n\nBy implementing a SVM approach to our data, we were able to show the potential of brain structural and functional alterations in distinguishing CBS patients from controls at the single-subject level. Both models alone performed moderately well, while their combination led to a slight but statistically non-significant improvement in discrimination power. Moreover, despite resting-state networks are consistent across subjects ( ) and are known to be altered in several diseases ( ), a recent meta-analysis showed a modest test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures ( ). Therefore, also considering the technical limitations in smaller clinical settings, we suggest that T1-MRI might be a better candidate for future clinical applications. Along this line, previous studies applied SVM for the automatic classification of neurodegenerative diseases using MRI structural data from different centers and MRI devices showing reasonably robust performances ( ;  ). Further supporting this view, we report a fair generalizability of SVM results on a completely independent dataset of CBS patients, especially when feature selection was   a priori   informed by ROIs defined from meta-analyses of previous VBM studies in CBS ( ). However, the usefulness of structural changes alone as specific CBS imaging markers might be hampered by the fact that partially similar structural alterations have been found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease ( ). \n\nCombining T1-MRI data with meta-analytically derived disease-specific neural networks might generally improve diagnosis and differential diagnosis as previously shown also for other several neurodegenerative diseases beside CBS ( ;  ;  ;  ). We believe that combining T1-MRI data with additional biomarkers (e.g. from cerebrospinal fluid) and clinical information would improve the differential diagnosis. Moreover, we propose that the training of similar machine learning models in larger CBS patient cohorts would lead to better classification accuracy and might eventually lead to the inclusion of new supportive imaging markers in the CBS diagnostic criteria, as it has already happened for other neurodegenerative diseases ( ;  ). \n\n### Limitations \n  \nWith this study we aimed at identifying diagnostic imaging biomarkers for clinically defined CBS. Consequently, we did not distinguish between different underlying neuropathological profiles of CBS, although known to potentially influence atrophy patterns ( ) and clinical presentation ( ). Here we reported CSF data for 14 out of 19 CBS patients, showing that only in one case values compatible with Alzheimer\u2019 disease were found. However, at the moment being, no specific CSF biomarkers have been included in the diagnostic criteria for CBS ( ), thus limiting the usefulness of this information. Additional studies with larger patient cohorts and autopsy-proven cases will be crucial to further disentangle this aspect. As abovementioned, differential diagnosis based on MRI biomarkers is another topic in need for further investigation. This still represents a tough challenge in the clinical work-up, for example when differentiating CBS from other parkinsonian or FTLD syndromes, especially in early disease stages. The addition of disease control groups will be needed to test specificity of our finding for CBS. Finally, in this study we implemented ECM as measure of brain functional network organization at rest. However, different methodological approaches might provide further insight into functional network changes in CBS and potentially lead to a different performance as diagnostic marker. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we described brain structural and novel data-driven functional connectivity abnormalities associated with CBS. In addition to the previously described structural brain changes, we contribute evidence for intriguing characteristic functional connectivity alterations in CBS. We further compared measures of connectivity and atrophy as potential supportive MRI-based imaging markers for   differentiating CBS patients and controls  . Overall, our results suggest that structural MRI is a promising candidate imaging marker for CBS and does not benefit from inclusion of additional rs-fMRI information. \n\n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the   (BMBF) by a grant given to the German FTLD Consortium (grant number FKZ O1GI1007 A), by the   (grant number PDF-IRG-1307), by the   (grant number 11362), by the   (DFG, SCHR 774/5-1), by the   (GACR 16-13323 S), and by the  , Czech Republic (project: Progres Q27/LF1).

This proposal builds on neurocomputational accounts of lexical processing and spoken word recognition and complementary learning systems (CLS) models of memory. We review evidence from behavioural studies of word learning that, consistent with the CLS account, show two stages of lexical acquisition: rapid initial familiarization followed by slow lexical consolidation. These stages map broadly onto two systems involved in different aspects of word learning: (i) rapid, initial acquisition supported by medial temporal and hippocampal learning, (ii) slower neocortical learning achieved by offline consolidation of previously acquired information. We review behavioural and neuroscientific evidence consistent with this account, including a meta-analysis of PET and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies that contrast responses to spoken words and pseudowords. From this meta-analysis we derive predictions for the location and direction of cortical response changes following familiarization with pseudowords. This allows us to assess evidence for learning-induced changes that convert pseudoword responses into real word responses. Results provide unique support for the CLS account since hippocampal responses change during initial learning, whereas cortical responses to pseudowords only become word-like if overnight consolidation follows initial learning. \n \n\n# Body\n \nRecent advances in information technology have led to significant changes in both the activities of daily life and the words that we use to describe those activities.

We propose that: (i) Isolated representations of new words are initially encoded like other novel experiences as \u2018episodic\u2019 memories of their first occurrences. These representations are supported by medial temporal lobe memory systems, functionally and neurally distinct from (ii) the neo-cortical representations that support long-term retention of words. Stable cortical representations are derived from multiple encounters with new words by consolidation processes that abstract away from the episodic representations that encode specific occurrences of novel words. Thus two distinct stages of learning and representation (initial episodic and subsequent lexical) are associated with the acquisition of new words. \n\nThis account of word learning directly parallels existing dual-systems accounts of memory processes in other domains. The goal of the current paper is therefore to develop a cognitive and neuroscientific account of word learning that reflects the computational constraints proposed by general accounts of memory processes. By integrating this framework with the specific computational demands of the perception of spoken language we can make detailed behavioural and neural predictions concerning processes involved in word learning. While the majority of this paper is focused on the acquisition of novel spoken rather than written words, our goal in developing this account is to achieve a broad coverage of phenomena that are relevant for word learning in general. \n\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. We first explore the complementary learning systems (CLS) model ( ), which partitions memory into hippocampal and neocortical components. These two systems contribute differentially to initial acquisition of episodic memories, and subsequent long-term retention, with transfer of information between these systems through offline consolidation. In the second section, we consider predictions from CLS accounts concerning the acquisition of new spoken words. These predictions are framed within the computational context of the Distributed Cohort Model of spoken word recognition ( ), and neuroanatomical constraints suggested by dorsal and ventral pathway accounts of spoken language processing ( ;  ;  ). Unifying these two aspects into a single, neurocomputational account of word learning requires that we: (i) specify the functional contribution of neocortical systems that retain long-term representations of spoken words, and (ii) explain how hippocampal/medial temporal memory systems interface with neocortical systems during acquisition. We will propose specific computational signatures of processes supported by rapid, hippocampal learning as distinct from slower neocortical learning mechanisms. Of particular interest, here, is the proposal that learning involves overnight, sleep-associated consolidation processes to mediate between fast-learning hippocampal and slow-learning neocortical systems. We will also derive specific predictions for behavioural differences between newly learned and consolidated novel words. \n\nNext we will review behavioural, neuropsychological and functional imaging evidence relating to this dual-process account. We begin by assessing behavioural evidence for two distinct stages of word learning. A particular focus of recent behavioural research has been to explore cognitive processes such as lexical competition that are unique to familiar words. Consistent with the CLS accounts we review evidence that newly learned words only become effective lexical competitors after offline consolidation. The next two sections review neuropsychological and functional imaging evidence for the involvement of two distinct neural systems in the medial temporal lobe and neocortex in word learning. We examine the evidence of impaired word learning in amnesic individuals with acquired or developmental injuries to the hippocampus, for whom word learning should be severely impaired according to the CLS account. Evidence that the medial temporal lobe contributes to initial word learning is also provided by functional imaging studies in which participants are scanned while learning new words. We then review evidence for cortical involvement in word recognition and learning. A particular focus for the CLS account is evidence from functional brain imaging studies in which neural responses are measured at different stages during the acquisition of novel words. Interpretation of these findings requires background information on the cortical systems that respond differently to familiar and unfamiliar spoken words. We therefore report a meta-analysis of functional imaging studies that compare words and pseudowords and test predictions derived from this meta-analysis for changes in neocortical responses to pseudowords following initial learning and consolidation. Finally we set out some outstanding questions and directions for future research. \n\n## The cls model \n  \nThe CLS model has much in common with other accounts of memory that invoke distinct learning systems specialized for different types of memory (e.g. procedural versus declarative,  ; semantic versus episodic,  ). However, the CLS account goes beyond these traditional descriptions by considering the computational properties of neural networks that learn from experience. An important distinction for network models is whether learned information is stored in independent, sparse codes (in which distinct memories have little or no overlap in their neural representations), or as overlapping, distributed representations that capture the similarity structure of specific domains of knowledge. The CLS account proposes two distinct memory systems for unique, context-specific representations (episodes), or knowledge that must be generalized beyond the specific context in which it is learned (semantic representations). These two forms of learning are best achieved by computational mechanisms that produce sparser, more independent representations and more overlapping, distributed representations, respectively. \n\nAs well as providing a computational basis for these distinct forms of memory, the CLS account also addresses many decades of research in neuropsychology and behavioural neuroscience aimed at understanding the specific contributions of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe systems that are impaired in amnesia (e.g.  ;  ;  ), and the neocortical memory systems that support the residual learning abilities of amnesic patients (e.g.  ). The CLS account proposes that sparse representations are rapidly and efficiently learned by the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe systems whereas overlapping, distributed representations are more slowly learned by the neocortex. Hence, amnesia caused by lesions to the hippocampus results in damage to learning mechanisms that are required to encode experiences rapidly into memory. Conversely, those aspects of memory function that are preserved in amnesic patients (such as repetition priming or motor learning), arise from the operation of neocortical learning processes independent of the hippocampus. \n\n### Computational properties of the CLS model \n  \nAs we have described, the computational properties of two distinct forms of connectionist learning algorithm are central to the CLS account. The motivation for these two forms of learning is a consideration of the strengths and limitations of neural networks taught using gradient descent learning algorithms. The parallel distributed processing (PDP,  ) approach to connectionist modelling of psychological processes commonly makes use of hidden units to mediate between input and output representations. These three-layer networks are trained to map from input to output by implementing gradual weight changes in the connections, using an algorithm such as backpropagation ( ). Such models have many attractive features, including the ability to generalize from trained mappings to novel items and performance that degrades gracefully in the face of simulated lesions (see   for discussion). \n\nHowever, robust performance and generalization has an associated cost since the use of gradual weight changes means that novel mappings can only be incorporated into a trained network slowly over the course of many presentations, and then only if the novel mapping is interleaved with instances of existing mappings. As   demonstrated, a dichotomous shift in the training patterns can lead to \u2018catastrophic interference\u2019, in which learning of new mappings eliminates previously learned mappings (see   for discussion). McCloskey and Cohen illustrated this with simulations of the AB\u2013AC memory paradigm ( ), in which participants first learn associations between word pairs (A\u2013B) and are then required to learn associations between the first of the original words and new words (A\u2013C pairs). Learning of new associations in humans typically produces a moderate reduction in recall of A\u2013B pairings, but in the connectionist networks, the effect of the new mappings was to essentially erase the network's memory for the original mapping. This aspect of the network's performance is perhaps unsurprising given that the distributed architecture encourages all mappings to rely on the same set of connection weights\u2014what is needed is a means of keeping newly learned mappings separate from the existing network on a temporary basis until new information can be properly integrated. \n\nThe CLS model ( ;  ;  ) provides a potential solution to this   stability\u2013plasticity dilemma   ( ). McClelland   et al  . described a dual-memory system model in which the main (neocortical) memory system operates using a learning algorithm producing distributed representations, as described above. This network has the ability to retain stable memories for long periods, despite changes in the form of the input (i.e. to generalize), and the structure of the network (i.e. robustness to damage). A second, hippocampal, system provides plasticity and can acquire new episodes without interference from previously or subsequently learned knowledge. This network is distinguished by its use of more sparse or near-localist representations, allowing representational independence and a means for swift learning of new patterns without overwriting existing knowledge. These rapidly learned representations in the hippocampal system can then be used to support slower, interleaved learning within the cortical system. \n\nThe CLS model has been applied to a broad range of memory phenomena such as the recollection/familiarity distinction in human recognition memory (e.g.  ) and discrimination and transitive inference tasks in rats ( ;  ). The details of the CLS model have been fleshed out (e.g.  ;  ), particularly for the hippocampal model and its interaction with other parts of the anterior and medial temporal lobe, which are important for acquisition and representation of unique instances. Recent instantiations of the CLS model also incorporate more neurobiologically realistic learning rules that can be implemented using only local connections, and weight-update schemes ( ). Nonetheless, the fundamental distinction between neocortical and hippocampal systems has not been substantially altered in recent descriptions and simulations. \n\nIn terms of interaction between the two systems,   suggested that a process of offline reinstatement of hippocampal memories drives further learning in the neocortex and a gradual reduction in the dependence of the memory on the hippocampus. At the same time, hippocampal memory traces were assumed to decay, either passively or through interference from newly instantiated hippocampal memories. In combination, these properties are invoked as an explanation of hippocampal amnesia. The reliance on the hippocampal network for the initial encoding and reinstantiation of episodic memory explains why amnesics are generally unable to retain such memories. On the other hand, memories that are formed gradually over the course of many different exposures, such as procedural skills, are more amenable to learning via the neocortical route despite the absence of short-term hippocampal storage. Once again, this fits with the classic description of learning abilities in amnesics (e.g.  ), although interestingly evidence of learning may not be restricted to non-declarative knowledge if the test of retention is chosen carefully. The CLS model does not involve any form of \u2018gating\u2019 in which memories are directed to the relevant system according to their type. Thus, new declarative knowledge should be processed by the neocortical route as well as the hippocampal route even though the effect of the neocortical exposure may be limited, given the gradual nature of learning in that system. \n\n tested the prediction that some limited knowledge can be supported solely through neo-cortical learning in two amnesics with near complete damage to the hippocampus and associated medial temporal lobe structures. Previous research had suggested that these amnesics showed no memory of post-onset facts and faces in conventional tests of recognition or recall ( ). However, in tests which permit participants to base their responses on feelings of familiarity (e.g. picking a famous face from non-famous foils), both amnesics showed evidence of some declarative knowledge acquired post-lesion although both were well below control performance. This result fits with the idea that the neocortex can incorporate new declarative information to some extent, even when interactions with the hippocampal system are unavailable (see also  ). We will return to this question in \u00a74 where we consider the impact of hippocampal lesions on word learning. \n\nA final crucial prediction of the CLS account relates to retrograde amnesia. Hippocampal amnesics typically reveal impaired performance on recall of memories prior to the onset of brain damage, with the severity of the impairment reducing as the time between memory establishment and amnesia onset increases ( ;  ). Similar effects can be found in the laboratory by lesioning the hippocampus in rats at different times following the formation of a new association ( ;  ). These findings can be explained by the CLS model in terms of the gradual transfer of hippocampal knowledge to the neocortex, and provides a measure of the duration of the hippocampal\u2013neocortical transfer process (several years in humans, several weeks in rats\u2014though faster consolidation may also be possible in highly schematized domains,  ). \n\n\n### Sleep and the CLS model \n  \nReinstatement of hippocampal memories in order to strengthen neocortical representation was considered by  , p. 424) to involve \u2018active rehearsal, reminiscence, and other inactive states including sleep\u2019. The potential involvement of sleep in the transfer process was motivated by research on hippocampal place cells in rats.  ; see also   correlated firing rates of hippocampal cells responding to particular locations during activity with the firing rates of those same cells in subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS). The results showed that SWS involves replay of the firing patterns found during activity, with the ordering of the firing retained during sleep.   elaborated on a potential role for sleep in the CLS model. They argued that sleep provides an opportunity for both hippocampal replay, and also for restructuring/strengthening memories via an oscillating learning algorithm ( ). These offline learning processes during sleep are argued to play a critical role in training neocortical systems\u2014indeed, separate \u2018wake\u2019 and \u2018sleep\u2019 phases are central to neural network learning algorithms that include biologically plausible forms of error-driven training ( ). \n\nIn the last 10 years a wealth of further neural evidence has amassed in support of some link between sleep and consolidation of hippocampal memories (e.g.  ;  ;  ). These advances have been paralleled in behavioural data, although this area remains controversial because of the many potential confounds involved in sleep research. For example, a study that shows superior performance on a memory task after overnight sleep as opposed to an equivalent time awake during the day may be confounded with time-of-day effects on performance ( ). If, on the other hand, time of day effects are controlled for by comparing overnight sleep with sleep deprivation overnight, then other confounds are possible relating to the effects of sleep deprivation. Several recent reviews cover this debate in detail (e.g.  ;  ;  ), with recent methodological advances (reviewed by  ) providing a convincing case in favour of a significant (if not unique) contribution of sleep to improvements in memory performance. \n\nThe declarative/non-declarative distinction has been useful in evaluating the influence of sleep on memory. It is relatively uncontroversial that aspects of procedural and perceptual (non-declarative) performance can improve following sleep. For example,   used selective sleep deprivation to show that visual texture discrimination was benefited by REM sleep but not by SWS. Similarly,   demonstrated a sleep-associated improvement in the ability to interpret synthesized speech. If listeners practised the task in the morning, the passing of time awake would lead to deterioration in perceptual skill by the evening. Thus, the change overnight could be thought of as a recovery of the originally strong performance (cf.  ). Other studies found similar performance enhancements across a range of non-declarative tasks (see  ;  ). \n\nUntil recently, the situation for declarative memory was less clear-cut, with a mixture of positive and negative results roughly balancing each other out (cf.  ). However, recent studies show more robust effects of sleep, at least for some types of declarative memory.   once again used selective deprivation to show an effect on paired-associate recall, although in this case the benefit was found for participants who were allowed SWS.   went further, demonstrating that paired-associate learning prior to sleep influenced neural activity during sleep. Specifically, EEG measurements of sleep spindle activity (short bursts of higher frequency waves) showed a rise associated with declarative learning in the non-REM component of early sleep.   provided an even clearer link between non-REM sleep and declarative memory by showing that artificially enhancing the oscillations in SWS using transcranial oscillating potentials led to improved retention of paired associates following sleep (see also  ;  ). \n\nThese and other studies have led to the conclusion that sleep benefits the consolidation of both declarative and non-declarative memories, with REM sleep implicated in the case of procedural and perceptual abilities and SWS involved in the consolidation of declarative memory. However, this dichotomy may be too simplistic, and it is important to note that learning may well involve both types of memory, either independently or interactively. Some recent studies have demonstrated that sleep can help to alter the form of memories, leading to new insights ( ;  ), possibly through greater linkage between hippocampal and neocortical systems. Similarly,   argue that sleep offers a means of integrating new information. In their case sleep facilitated the transitive inference to link pairs of premises. For example, given the information that B > C, C > D and D > E separately, participants found it easier to decide that B > E after sleep. This integrative aspect of sleep-related consolidation is a crucial one in the case of vocabulary, given that we need to be able to distinguish words from their neighbours (semantically, orthographically and phonologically) in order to recognize and understand them (cf. Dumay & Gaskell  ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Applying the cls model to spoken word learning \n  \nBased on the above review, we can outline how word learning might operate if it makes use of CLS principles. We begin by specifying the functional and anatomical organization of the neocortical networks involved in recognising spoken words. A particular focus here is a computational account of the perception and identification of spoken words constructed using a distributed connectionist model (the Distributed Cohort Model, Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson  ,  ). This network captures important functional properties of spoken word recognition, including optimally efficient use of incoming information in the speech signal, robustness to noise and variation in the perceptual form of speech, and competition between phonologically similar lexical items. All these forms of behaviour arise as emergent properties of a neural network model in which multiple, similar words are stored in overlapping neural representations. We therefore propose this model as an approximation to the neocortical component of the CLS account of word learning. In this section we begin by laying out the structure of the model, and the parallels between this neural network account and the anatomical organization of the cortical networks involved in perceiving speech. We then move onto a discussion of how CLS principles can be incorporated to provide an account of word learning. \n\n### The distributed cohort model and neocortical networks for speech perception \n  \nThe Distributed Cohort Model ( ) uses a simple recurrent network ( ) to map from a sequence of acoustic\u2013phonetic features representing ongoing speech input onto a distributed representation of lexical knowledge. While the input provided in simulations using the Distributed Cohort Model is abstracted from the surface detail of speech for computational convenience, we can assume that the input to the system corresponds to complex spectro-temporal feature representations encoded in primary auditory regions on the superior temporal plane (e.g.  ;  ). From these features, both the model and current neuroscientific accounts postulate hierarchically organized processing pathways that extract different forms of abstract linguistic representation from ongoing speech input (see   for a depiction of the Distributed Cohort Model and corresponding regions of the temporal lobe). \n  \nNeural and functional organization of systems involved in representing and learning spoken words. (  a  ) Left temporal lobe regions involved in perceiving and comprehending spoken words (based on  ;  ) and their interactions with medial temporal systems for word learning. (  b  ) Functional organization of the Distributed Cohort Model (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson  ,  ; depicted within the grey box) with additional connections to hippocampal/episodic memory system for learning new words. In both diagrams, rapid cortico-cortico connections are shown with solid lines, and slower, cortico-hippocampal connections are shown with broken lines. Dotted lines with open arrow-heads show recurrent connections involved in maintaining acoustic-phonetic representations in echoic memory. \n  \nIn mapping sequences of speech segments onto lexical representations, the Distributed Cohort Model requires short-term storage so that information in the speech input can be accumulated over time, and sequences of phonemes can be discriminated. This is achieved in network simulations by including recurrent connections at the hidden unit level such that the model can take into account both the current input, and a representation of prior input during perception. These recurrent connections provided sufficient short-term storage for effective lexical processing in simulations thus far. However, in order to recognize temporally extended sequences, it might be that more complex computational architectures in which there is greater duplication of representations over time or a hierarchy of perceptual representations with progressively longer temporal receptive fields would be required. For this reason, we suggest that the hidden units, along with their recurrent connections, correspond to neuroanatomical systems that provide a form of transient memory for previously heard auditory input\u2014auditory echoic memory functions subserved by anterior regions of the superior temporal gyrus ( ;  ;  ). The short-term storage provided by auditory echoic memory plays a particular role in the perception of spoken sentences ( ) hence the frequent observation of anterior temporal activation in brain imaging studies of sentence comprehension ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOne distinctive property of the lexical representations that are the target output for the Distributed Cohort Model is that they separate the phonological form and the meaning of spoken words. These dual-outlets have distinct roles in accounting for the specific psycholinguistic tasks that are to be simulated by the model. The semantic output is more critical for making lexical/semantic decisions, producing semantic priming and for simulating tasks that involve access to word meaning. In contrast, the phonological output is more critical for making phonological decisions, repeating spoken words and non-words and in simulations of cross-modal repetition priming (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson  ,  ). This separation of lexical identification into two distinct processes has clear parallels in current neuroanatomical accounts of auditory language pathways, which postulate distinct dorsal and ventral processing pathways (Hickok & Poeppel  ,  ;  ). Several authors have converged on the suggestion that the critical function of the posterior-going auditory stream in the superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe is to map heard speech onto phonological representations involved in speaking (see  ; Hickok & Poeppel  ,   for review and discussion). \n\nIn contrast to the neural substrates of phonological processing, there is rather less agreement concerning the critical pathways involved in accessing meaning from speech. This may reflect the fact that the neural systems involved in representing meaning are anatomically distributed and perhaps include regions that encode sensory-motor attributes of spoken word meaning ( ;  ;  ). However, at least for the majority of concrete, content nouns, we follow the proposal made by Hickok & Poeppel  ,  ) and others ( ;  ), and suggest that the posterior inferior temporal and fusiform gyri play a crucial role in accessing the meaning of spoken words. These regions therefore mostly clearly correspond to the semantic output of the Distributed Cohort Model. \n\n\n### Incorporating word learning into the distributed cohort model \n  \nIn describing its architecture, and correspondences between different components with underlying neuroanatomical systems, we have omitted one critical feature of the model. That is we have not explained how appropriately weighted connections between units in the network are established. In simulations these connection weights are initialized to small random values and a backpropagation learning algorithm is used to adjust the weights in the network. This procedure allows gradual learning of a set of training words over the course of many presentations. The overlapping, distributed representations produced by this learning process permit accurate recognition of familiar words despite variable input and appropriate generalization to novel input sequences. One example of these properties is that following training with a large set of words, the model is able to generate an accurate phonological representation for non-words. However, in order to learn from presentation of these non-words (e.g. to activate an appropriate semantic representation or predict upcoming phonetic input) further changes to the connection weights of the network are required. As we have already described, neural network models trained using back-propagation show a dramatic form of interference when additional novel items are to be learned. That is, new words must be interleaved with existing words if they are to be acquired by the network. \n\nWe propose that a fully fledged CLS model of word learning needs a separate route in which sparse representations mediate between the representations of novel speech sequences (like the representations of sequences of speech features in the superior temporal gyrus) and lexical knowledge of the phonological form and meaning of new words (  b  ). We propose an account in which connections between networks for speech perception in the lateral temporal lobe and memory systems in the medial temporal lobe (particularly the hippocampus) play a critical role in the acquisition of new words. Specifically, we propose that sparse representations of new words are rapidly acquired by the hippocampus (based on inputs provided by the cortical network). These connections support the recognition of newly learned words while existing neo-cortical connections operate in parallel and continue to support the identification of pre-existing, known words ( ). \n\nIf a dual-process model such as this underlies word learning and word recognition, what effects would be predicted for the time course of learning? Accessing the meaning and phonological form of a novel word should be viable as soon as the word has been learned, assuming that this information is provided during the learning process. Retrieval in these circumstances relies on the hippocampal route, which can operate independently of the main speech perception system. However, these hippocampal representations can only be integrated into the main neocortical recognition system offline over a longer time period. We suggest that sleep provides a means of reinstantiating hippocampal memories for neocortical learning. Data from amnesics suggest that such integration could take years or even decades to complete, although recent demonstrations of sleep effects on memory indicate that faster initial changes are also possible. In particular, effects such as   finding that acquiring transitive representations of ordered picture pairs requires overnight consolidation provide strong evidence in favour of the idea that one of the key roles for sleep is the   integration   of hippocampal memories. Therefore, we can expect changes in neural representation of novel words following sleep, with shifts in the balance between hippocampal and neocortical representations. These changes may be associated with facilitated recognition of the novel words or access to their meanings, and by increases in the extent to which novel words influence the recognition of existing words. \n\nAlthough hippocampal learning means that new form\u2013meaning mappings can be acquired swiftly, there may be computational consequences of the fact that the new mapping is kept separate from the existing mappings. In particular, there may be time-course differences in terms of the speed of access of newly learned and existing words, depending on how quickly the two routes operate. Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson  ,  ) argued that one advantage of a PDP-style architecture for spoken-word recognition was that the state of the output units of the network directly reflects the likelihoods of the lexical candidates. For example, given the partial speech input /k\u00e6ptI/, the network output would be a \u2018blend\u2019 of the distributed representations of the two matching words   captain   and   captive  , with the similarity of the blend to each target representation being proportional to the frequency of the two words. This state of affairs can be thought of as optimally efficient in terms of its use of partial information in the speech signal. \n\nHowever, once the hippocampal route is brought into play and additional competitors have been learned, there is the possibility of losing optimality. Imagine the case where a listener learned the new word /k\u00e6ptIk/ (  captick  ). This new competitor would initially be learned via the hippocampal route, which would allow the appropriate distributed representation to be activated on presentation of the full spoken word. However, the state of activation of the output units prior to the final phoneme (/k\u00e6ptI/) is potentially compromised. The neocortical route will still reflect the relative likelihoods of the two pre-existing words that it has been trained on, and the hippocampal route will reflect the episodic representation of the new word. However, the isolation of the hippocampal route means that the relative probability of the new word cannot be properly incorporated into the weighted blend of   captain   and   captive  . The outcome in these circumstances therefore depends on the balance between the two routes. If the hippocampal route is weighted too highly then something similar to catastrophic interference occurs, in that learning new words (e.g.   captick  ) may interfere with the ability to recognize existing words (e.g.   captain   or   captive  ). On the other hand, if the hippocampal route is weighted too weakly, the ability to retrieve stored information about the novel word is lost. One solution may be to have some kind of prioritization, such that the neocortical route is dominant up to the point where that route fails to recognize a familiar item. After this point, hippocampal activations can be taken into account (possibly by inducing a time delay in the hippocampal mapping). Such a solution would allow novel spoken words to be recognized, but would mean that they do not influence the recognition of existing competitors until they have been incorporated into the neocortical route. It might also suggest that the hippocampal route would have to operate more slowly than a purely neocortical recognition process and consequently that consolidation should serve to speed-up recognition of recently learned words. \n\n\n\n## Behavioural evidence for complementary processes in word learning \n  \nAs we have seen in the previous section, the CLS account makes specific predictions concerning the neuroanatomical substrates of word learning and the functional characteristics of these processes. In particular, the CLS account predicts changes in the time-course of recognition of both novel and pre-existing words as a consequence of new learning and offline consolidation. It is only once consolidated into neocortical representations that newly learned words (e.g.   captick  ) should be recognized quickly and efficiently, and be able to compete with existing words like   captain  . In this section we will review the existing literature on the time-course of identification of newly learned words with the goal of assessing evidence for the CLS account. \n\nTracking of speech\u2013contingent eye movements has proved to be a rich source of information about the time-course of spoken language processing across a variety of domains (e.g.  ;  ;  ). These experiments make use of a visual scene with objects chosen to inform about the lexical hypotheses and predictions that are made during the online processing of speech. For example,   used pictures of cohort pairs (e.g.   beaker   and   beetle  ), plus rhyming competitors (e.g.   speaker  ) and unrelated competitors (e.g.   carriage  ) and measured the probability of fixating each picture as participants listened to target words (e.g.   beaker  ). The plot of fixation probability against time for each of these target types proved to be a highly sensitive measure of lexical activation for the different types of competitor, leading to a better understanding of the strength of cohort members and rhyming words as competitors in spoken word recognition. \n\nThese experiments have often made use of novel words as a way of manipulating the parameters of interest (e.g. semantic properties,  ).   used artificial lexicons to create stimulus sets that mimicked the cohort and rhyme relationships described above (e.g. target /pibo/ with cohort /pibu/, rhyme /dibo/ and unrelated /tupa/ distractors). Participants learned these words over the course of two days by associating them with visually presented abstract shapes. Magnuson   et al  . showed that word-like competition could be measured for these sets using probability fixation curves. Furthermore, frequency effects from newly learned neighbours were apparent in fixations even when the competitor shape was not present. In terms of the CLS approach, we can assume that the novel words were largely encoded hippocampally on the first day of these experiments and then jointly coded after sleep. Interestingly, although differences in performance levels between the two days were not dramatic, two experiments failed to show any effect of the relative likelihood of different types of competitor (cohort versus rhyme or high versus low frequency) on Day 1, though these effects were evident on the second day. It may be that the extra training on Day 1 allowed these relative weightings to be established more clearly on Day 2. However, an alternative explanation suggested by the CLS account is that the hippocampal route is less able to differentiate between candidates on the basis of likelihood. This would fit with the idea that the hippocampus simply requires some threshold to be reached in order to learn a mapping, with a habituation response to subsequent presentations. \n\n final experiment went further in testing whether fixation probabilities to novel words could be modulated by the competitor environment of the listener's pre-existing lexicon. Novel words varying in neighbourhood environment (defined on the basis of the pre-existing lexicon) were learned as in previous experiments over the course of two days. Despite target frequency effects emerging (at least on Day 2), there were only hints of an effect of neighbourhood, and only for low frequency words. Thus, the novel lexicon could be considered \u2018functionally isolated from the native lexicon\u2019 (Magnuson   et al  . p. 223). This result might suggest that the novel words were held separate from the pre-existing lexicon in the hippocampal mapping (even on the second day). Alternatively this result could be a kind of context effect. Given that the stimuli at test were exclusively novel words, it may be that the language system is able to eliminate pre-existing words from the competition process early on, meaning that the neighbourhood environment of the novel words is no longer relevant (cf. Magnuson   et al  . 2008). \n\nRather than examining the effect of the existing lexicon on recognition of novel words,   looked at whether learning novel words could influence the processing of existing words. The study made use of words such as   cathedral   that are uniquely identifiable early on in the word. Pseudowords that diverged from these existing words only at or after the uniqueness point (e.g.   cathedruke  ) were selected to be taught to the participants as novel words. Critically, engagement of the novel words in lexical competition should lead to a delay in the recognition of words like   cathedral  , because the uniqueness point of the existing word had shifted closer to the end of the word (  a  ). Participants were taught the novel words via phoneme monitoring and effects of this learning were tested the following day, with further cycles of exposure and test over the course of 5 days. When tested on the recognition of the form of the novel word using a two-alternative forced choice test with a minimally diverging foil (e.g.   cathedruce  ), performance was close to ceiling at first test (93%), and remained at or above this level at later tests. However, the effect of novel word learning on recognition of the existing words was slow to emerge. These changes were measured using a lexical decision task measuring responses to   cathedral   in comparison with counterbalanced control words for which no neighbouring novel word was learned. A lexical competition effect was absent on days 2 and 3 but then emerged on the final two days. Furthermore, the effect was selective for the case where novel words were onset-matching neighbours of the existing word. As predicted by models of spoken word recognition such as the Distributed Cohort Model, equivalent overlap at the end but not the beginning of the word (e.g.   yothedral-cathedral  ) showed no competition effect on any day. \n  \nImpact of initial learning and sleep-associated consolidation on lexical representations and word recognition. (  a  ) Speech waveforms for tokens of an existing word (  cathedral  ) and a new word (  cathedruke  ) with a marker showing the approximate time point at which the acoustic-phonetic input for   cathedral   diverges from all other known words (uniqueness point, cf.  ). The uniqueness point for   cathedral   is markedly later (orange line versus blue line) if the new word   cathedruke   must also be ruled out. (  b  ) Lexical organization of these words after learning and before or after sleep-associated consolidation. Before sleep (blue box) the strongest lexical competitor for   cathedral   is   cathartic  , hence the uniqueness point is reached once this word can be ruled out (early uniqueness point shown in   a  ). After sleep (orange box), the addition of a new lexical competitor is such that additional speech input is required to rule out   cathedruke   (late uniqueness point shown in   a  ). (  c  ) Pause detection response times showing the impact of learning and consolidation on lexical competition (data replotted from  ). Two groups of participants were trained on novel words (e.g.   cathedruke  ) at either 8.00 h or 20.00 h and tested on matched items with and without new lexical competitors 0, 12 or 24 h after training. Responses to existing words were significantly delayed by competition from newly learned words only for those conditions in which sleep intervened between training and testing (orange bars). \n  \nBecause the above experiment used multiple training sessions over several days it is not clear whether the lexical competition effect is simply dependent on a critical level of exposure being reached, or whether a consolidation period is also required. A further experiment addressed this issue using a single more extensive training session (36 presentations of each novel word) and lexical competition tests immediately and one week afterwards. These tests used a pause detection task, in which listeners are asked to monitor for silent pauses inserted in the existing words (e.g.   cathe_dral  ).   (see also  ) have demonstrated that this task is sensitive to the overall level of lexical activity at the pause position and hence should provide an index of lexical competition.   showed that soon after the single intensive learning session there was excellent 2AFC recognition of the novel words, but no evidence of increased competition in pause detection for existing words. However, this competition effect was evident a week later on retest. The dissociation between form recognition and engagement in lexical competition is strong evidence in favour of the dual process CLS account of word learning, outlined above (see   b   for a sketch of these changes in lexical organization). \n\nSubsequent studies have shown similar divisions between swift and delayed aspects of learning novel words. When novel words were assigned clear meanings in sentence contexts during training, the emergence of lexical competition was again delayed, though in this case competition effects were found a day after initial learning ( ). The same paper showed that the competition effect was not restricted to offset-diverging neighbours such as   cathedruke   and   cathedral  , but also for novel words that embedded the existing words (e.g.   shadowks   and   shadow  , cf.  ). This experiment also included both a recognition memory test and a free recall test, in which participants were given 3 min to recall as many of the novel items as they could. These explicit memory tests also showed improvements on the second day of the experiment. Thus delayed effects of lexical learning can also be detected in explicit memory tests of novel words with a sufficiently demanding task. \n\nGiven the delayed emergence of lexical competition and associated improvements in recall,   attempted to tease apart effects of time and sleep after learning. Two groups of participants were trained on a set of novel words either at 08.00 or 20.00. Participants were then tested on their knowledge of these words straight after training, 12 and 24 h later. The tests included 2AFC recognition, free recall and pause detection, as in previous experiments. Both groups exhibited good recognition of the novel items immediately and at all retests, with no differences emerging. In contrast, pause detection showed an association between nocturnal sleep and the emergence of lexical competition effects. Test detection rates were slowed relative to control only for the conditions that had a night's sleep between training and test (i.e. after 12 and 24 h for the group starting in the evening, and after 24 h for the group starting in the morning). Because any circadian influences should apply equally to test and control conditions, these data are strong evidence in favour of an association between nocturnal sleep and integration of lexical information, and fit well with other studies implying an integrative role for sleep. Participants' free recall also showed an interaction between training group and time. There were improvements in free recall rate between subsequent test points in all cases where sleep intervened between the testing points and also when both test points followed sleep. The only case where improvement was not seen was for the group trained in the morning and then tested prior to sleep, where there was a marginally significant deterioration in recall rate. This observation fits well with the wider memory research in showing a protective aspect of sleep after learning (e.g.  ). \n\nThe lexical competition studies described above (and the similarly delayed emergence of competition effects in studies of visual word learning,  ) are consistent with a model in which the hippocampus provides an initial means of binding representations of novel words in the short term. Integration of novel words with existing words occurs over a longer period of time and is associated with nocturnal sleep. Results that implicate the first night after learning as critical for consolidation do not imply a dichotomous transfer of knowledge. However, in those studies that test for an effect of a single night of sleep, it does appear to produce observable changes in behaviour. A further crucial prediction of the CLS approach is that the competition effect that emerges in the days following first learning should remain robust over a longer time-course, and may even strengthen. Although competition effects have not been tracked over a time-course of years (cf.  ),   did examine the profile of lexical competition effects for several months following learning. Competition effects as measured by lexical decision were still robust at the final test point eight months after training, with some suggestion of enhanced competition effects by the end of the experiment. Although training only occurred at the beginning of the experiment, each test point did provide limited reactivation of novel word representations. Nonetheless, there were long periods of up to 17 weeks without any testing, and no significant reductions in the strength of competition effects after these gaps. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of learning that are found in these experiments are robust in the longer term. \n\nOne feature of all the experiments described so far is that they used multiple test sessions, including a test for lexical competition after learning but prior to sleep. Conceivably, this test session could have had a causal role in the emergence of lexical competition after sleep (e.g. through reactivation/reconsolidation,  ;  ; or through sleep-associated consolidation of test tasks,  ;  ). We might therefore predict that competition effects would not be found after sleep if the competition test was not administered prior to sleep.   tested this by teaching people two sets of novel words, one the day before testing and one on the day of testing. There was no competition effect from words learned that day, but words learned the previous day did produce a competition effect and faster response times in a speeded repetition task. This result does not rule out involvement of reconsolidation or task-learning in the effects described previously, but it does imply that lexical competition effects can emerge in the absence of reconsolidation of the pre-existing word representation, or repetition of test tasks. The partial transfer of the novel memory from hippocampal to neocortical storage stands out as the most parsimonious explanation of this result. \n\nAlthough the above studies show that some aspects of lexical processing rely on a late-emerging representation, there are other aspects of word learning that do not require consolidation.   looked at the ability of novel words to influence phoneme judgements in the context of compensation for the effects of assimilation. Previous research ( ) has shown that listeners can use the following context of a segment to compensate for the change in place of articulation that often occurs in speech production. For example, in the sequence   freight bearer  , the final consonant of   freight   is often similar to /p/ in connected speech. In perception, listeners make use of the following context to compensate for this shift, but this contextual compensation occurs more for words than for non-words. Snoeren   et al  . found that newly learned words immediately affected the tendency to use context to compensate for assimilation, and once again the strength of the compensation was no different for a separate set of items learned the previous day. The only effect of a 24-h period of consolidation was to facilitate response times overall, supporting the CLS proposal that word recognition should be speeded-up by overnight consolidation. \n\nSedin & colleagues ( ;  ) examined influences of newly learned words on speech perception using artificial phonetic continua, testing the extent to which novel words could bias listeners' perceptions of ambiguous phonemes. Many studies have shown that listeners' judgements in these cases are biased towards responses consistent with a word as opposed to a non-word (e.g. with an ambiguous (d/t) in the context of (d/t)ask, listeners are more likely to choose /t/, consistent with the word task;  ). Sedin found that novel words could produce a similar bias immediately after learning and this effect remained of equivalent strength the following week. The only hint of a consolidation effect was again in response times, where speed benefits were found only at the second test point. \n\n asked a related question concerning the influence of newly acquired lexical items on speech perception. They made use of the observation that spoken words (but not non-words) can drive changes to phoneme-category boundaries. For instance,   showed that hearing words in which one phoneme was consistently replaced by an ambiguous phoneme (e.g. replacing the /s/ in   peace  ,   rinse   and   crease   with an ambiguous form, half way between /s/ and /f/) causes a shift in listeners' categorization of an artificial continuum involving that phoneme. Crucially, this compensatory adjustment to the category boundary only occurred when the ambiguous phoneme was embedded in words, as opposed to pseudowords. Leach and Samuel tested whether newly learned novel words could show the same top-down influence on phoneme perception. They found that non-words can show this lexical effect as long as they were assigned a meaning in some way during training. Strongest effects emerged when pictures were associated with the novel words, when training did not involve pronunciation, and effects seemed to strengthen over the course of 5 days. The typical result, however, was that although type of training was crucial, the amount of time since first exposure was not. This contrasts strongly with the effects of lexical competition, where type of training seems irrelevant and time is crucial. \n\nThe latter experiments show that learning a new form can influence judgements about the form of speech soon after learning, which could be interpreted as evidence for immediate neocortical learning of novel words. Returning to the model sketched out at the beginning of this section, however, we can see that both hippocampal and neocortical routes have links with the lexical phonology level, and so in both cases we should see biases in phonological processing and the ability to evoke longer-term shifts in the categorization of speech. If, as we have speculated, the indirect hippocampal route to phonological representations is relatively slow then the response time advantage enjoyed by the 24-h delay conditions for phoneme monitoring in   and for delayed repetition in  , may be due to a partial shift in reliance away from the hippocampal route and towards the direct neocortical route. \n\nIn sum, we have seen that a CLS approach to vocabulary acquisition fits well with the picture we have from behavioural data. Most aspects of lexical processing are available straight after learning and according to the CLS account may therefore be hippocampally mediated. However, there is a small but important set of behavioural properties that emerge later after sleep and which are probably associated with neocortical representations. Engagement in lexical competition is the best studied of these, but there also seem to be advantages in ability to recall words, and swifter processing of the novel words (in speeded repetition and assimilated segment detection) once integration into the neocortical route has begun. The neural predictions, however, can only be tested indirectly in behavioural studies. We therefore turn to neuropsychological and neuroimaging data as a more direct test of the CLS account. \n\n\n## Medial temporal contributions to word learning \n  \nIn this section we review neuroscientific evidence in support of the CLS proposal that rapid initial learning is dependent on medial temporal lobe systems including the hippocampus (cf.  ;  ). We begin by reviewing evidence for new word learning in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe lesions before assessing convergent evidence from functional imaging studies, primarily using fMRI. \n\n### Neuropsychological evidence \n  \nIn \u00a71 we reviewed the basic pattern of impairment associated with damage to the hippocampus and surrounding regions of the medial temporal lobe. Here, we focus on the question of whether amnesics are able to learn new items of vocabulary. Studies of the late patient HM showed significantly impaired acquisition of words that came into the language after his bilateral resection of the medial temporal lobe ( ), although forced-choice and cued testing procedures revealed above-chance performance ( ). Such findings suggest that amnesic syndromes are accompanied by impaired post-lesion learning of new words. However, recent anatomical investigations showed that HM had a more extensive bilateral lesion encompassing the hippocampus and adjacent regions of perirhinal and entorhinal cortex ( ). Further evidence is therefore required if we are to assess the unique contribution of the hippocampus to word learning. \n\nPatients with lesions confined to the hippocampus appear to show less marked impairments in the acquisition of new words. One important source of evidence concerning more circumscribed medial temporal lesions comes from observations of developmental amnesia following anoxic episodes during birth ( ). This aetiology often leads to bilateral damage confined largely to the hippocampus ( ). Despite severe impairments in episodic memory, these children can show performance within the normal range in assessments of language function including tests of word knowledge ( ;  ). Although these observations suggest that longer-term word learning can occur in the absence of the hippocampus, it might still be the case that the hippocampus normally plays a role in the initial acquisition and maintenance of new words. \n\nTo explore the impact of hippocampal lesions on initial acquisition a number of authors have used laboratory tests of word and concept learning in patients with developmental or adult-acquired lesions of the hippocampus. The consensus from these studies is that while new learning is possible, it remains weak by comparison with control participants. For instance,   showed that a developmental amnesic with bilateral hippocampal lesions had impaired acquisition of new names and concepts in laboratory situations. Although this patient had a severe impairment (perhaps due to damage to the surrounding entorhinal and perirhinal regions), a patient with amnesia due to mamillary body lesions showed a milder impairment of word and concept learning compared with controls. A single case study of Jon, a developmental amnesic with hypoxia-induced bilateral hippocampal damage also showed significantly slowed acquisition of new words and associated semantics under laboratory conditions ( ). Though some learning was possible it required greater numbers of repetition over several days of training. Thus, these results suggest that intact word knowledge in developmental amnesia arises from the operation of slower (perhaps cortically based) learning processes, consistent with the CLS account. \n\nOne question that arises in considering evidence from these developmental populations, however, is whether preservation of learning following early-onset hippocampal lesions reflects cortical learning mechanisms that remain plastic during childhood but would be absent following late acquired lesions. It is therefore reassuring that studies using adult amnesics largely confirm the pattern shown in these developmental studies. For instance,  , showed that two amnesic patients with medial temporal lesions had impaired (though non-zero) knowledge of words that came into the language after the date of their lesions. Interestingly, of the two patients tested, a more severe impairment was observed in patient SS who subsequent to Herpes Simplex Encephalitis had lesions of both the hippocampus and adjacent entorhinal/perirhinal cortices. This is consistent with the profile of the developmental amnesic tested by  . Nonetheless, patient PS whose lesion was confined to the hippocampus also showed impaired knowledge of words that entered into the language after the anoxic episode that led to her amnesia. Two patients tested by Bayley and colleagues with more extensive lesions of the medial temporal lobe (encompassing most all of the hippocampus and rhinal cortices) also showed some post-lesion word learning since these patients could distinguish new words (e.g.   prozac   from foils   flozam  ,   flozac  , etc) with above chance accuracy ( ). As well as word-form familiarity, both patients provided evidence of semantic knowledge of these words (e.g. knowing that a \u2018website\u2019 was a word associated with computers). Nonetheless, both patients had highly impoverished knowledge of new words by comparison with controls. Thus, evidence from adult and developmental amnesia would together imply that new word learning is severely impaired by bilateral hippocampal lesions. We therefore conclude that the initial acquisition of new words involves a similar dependence on medial temporal lobe learning systems to other forms of item-specific and associative learning (see   for a review). Some limited, residual learning abilities remain in amnesic patients, which we propose are supported by slower neocortical learning. \n\n\n### Functional neuroimaging evidence \n  \nConvergent evidence for hippocampal contributions to word learning has come from functional imaging studies in which participants are scanned while learning new words. One of the most persuasive demonstrations that hippocampal activation is associated with initial acquisition compared neural responses to consistent and inconsistent combinations of spoken pseudowords and pictures over five repetitions of these pairings ( ). Consistent pairings enabled participants to learn the picture\u2013pseudoword associations, as shown by behavioural performance during and after scanning. Although activation differences between the consistent and inconsistent pairings were only observed in the right inferior frontal gyrus, there was also a significant linear decline in left hippocampal activity over five presentations of each consistent pairing, whereas the inconsistent pairings showed no such decline. Furthermore, a cross-subject analysis showed that participants who produced a greater response to the initial presentation of consistent pairings and a smaller decline in activation subsequently had better memory for the word\u2013picture pairings. Thus, the authors concluded that hippocampal activation is associated with successful learning of spoken-word to picture pairings. \n\nA subsequent fMRI experiment replicated this association between medial temporal activity and initial learning of form-meaning pairings for novel written words ( ). Mestres-Misse   et al  . contrasted fMRI responses to written pseudowords presented at the offset of sentences that provided either a consistent or inconsistent meaning for that pseudoword. Comparison of consistent and inconsistent meaning pairings revealed activation clusters in the precuneus, left thalamus, and anterior parahippocampal gyrus\u2014the latter cluster probably including perirhinal regions lesioned in patients with more severe impairments of word learning. Interestingly, an ERP version of this experiment showed a progressive reduction in the magnitude of the N400 to sentence-final non-words provided with consistent meanings ( ). Evidence from intracranial ERPs might suggest that at least one plausible generator of the N400 effect is localized in medial temporal regions consistent with the activation observed in their fMRI paradigm ( ;  ), though this localization has been disputed (see  ). These findings, like the results of Breitenstein, suggest a role for the medial temporal lobe in learning associations between pseudowords and meanings. However, the studies leave unclear whether activation reflects involvement of medial temporal lobe systems in associative learning (consistent with hippocampal activation during successful learning of word\u2013word and face\u2013name associations:  ;  ;  ), or a more general role in initial encoding of novel stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nTwo recent studies in fMRI and PET, respectively, answer this question; first by showing that hippocampal activation is associated with successful encoding of novel spoken pseudowords in the absence of accompanying pictures or semantic information ( ), second by showing equivalent medial temporal activity for form learning and associative learning ( ). In Davis   et al  . (which will be reviewed in more detail subsequently), participants were presented with three sets of novel spoken pseudowords of which two had received extensive training prior to scanning. Activation of the hippocampus was primarily observed for those pseudowords that were entirely novel at the time of presentation, and declined rapidly with subsequent repetitions when these items were no longer truly novel. Furthermore, the magnitude of initial activation to novel pseudowords and the magnitude of the subsequent decline in activity on repetition predicted performance in a post-scanning forced-choice recognition memory test. Hence, this study suggests a role for the hippocampus in initial encoding of novel word forms, irrespective of whether participants associate these items with pictures or other semantic information. Confirmation of similar medial temporal involvement in form learning and associative learning comes from   who used PET to compare responses to words and pseudowords in both these tasks. Again, we will discuss cortical activation observed in this study subsequently, however, with regard to the medial temporal lobe both associative and form learning responses to pseudowords declined over time in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole. Form learning and associative learning thus recruit similar medial temporal structures\u2014though in this study these were located outside of the hippocampus. \n\nIn all these studies medial temporal activation during word learning reduced rapidly with stimulus repetition and most clearly predicted behavioural measures of successful learning (though the Paulesu study did not test this correlation). Such findings support the CLS proposal that medial temporal lobe systems are specialized for the rapid acquisition of new information, including language. This account would also explain the absence of hippocampal activation in studies in which participants received extensive training on novel items prior to testing ( ;  ). We next turn to evidence for the second neural prediction of the CLS account: that neocortical representations support long-term recognition of words and that cortical representations of pseudowords emerge slowly following stimulus familiarization and offline consolidation. \n\n\n\n## Cortical contributions to word learning \n  \nIn contrast to medial temporal lobe systems, which are proposed to play a time-limited role in initial acquisition of spoken words, the CLS account predicts that a common set of cortical systems are involved in acquiring stable representations of new words and retaining those representations over the longer term. In assessing the contribution of cortical regions to word learning, then, we will first consider evidence from neuropsychology concerning the neural regions that support knowledge of familiar words. In a second section, we report a meta-analysis of functional imaging studies which contrasted neural responses to familiar words and unfamiliar (i.e. untrained) pseudowords. This meta-analysis assists in the interpretation of functional imaging studies that assess changes to the neural response to spoken pseudowords during and after familiarization. A stringent test of these studies is whether they provide evidence concerning the time-course by which pseudoword responses become word-like during and subsequent to acquisition. The CLS account makes the strong prediction that offline consolidation is required to generate stable neocortical representations of pseudowords. \n\n### Neuropsychological evidence \n  \nAn important source of evidence concerning the cortical systems that are critical for word recognition comes from neuropsychological studies assessing brain areas that produce a significant impairment in the comprehension of familiar words when lesioned. In reviewing this work, we will focus on studies that link behavioural assessment of groups of neuropsychological patients to data from MRI scans revealing the location and extent of individual patient's lesions. Voxel-by-voxel analysis methods similar to those employed in functional brain imaging can thus be used for statistical assessment of lesion\u2013symptom associations. Interestingly, the results of these analyses provide two distinct answers to the question of which brain regions produce impaired single word comprehension when lesioned. \n\nLesion\u2013symptom maps for speech comprehension impairments in a large group of aphasic stroke patients suggest an association between lesions and impaired comprehension in a region of the posterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG) extending into inferior temporal regions ( ). This anatomical location overlaps substantially with the posterior temporal system highlighted as contributing to lexical semantic processing in   a  . Since Bates and co-workers used a single, composite measure of comprehension (derived from behavioural responses to \u2018yes/no\u2019 questions, following simple and complex commands, and an assessment of single word comprehension using word to picture/object matching), it is unclear whether comprehension impairments arise from impaired lexical processing. It is therefore encouraging that a follow-up study using a more sophisticated language battery ( ) suggests that posterior MTG lesions are specifically associated with impairments of single word comprehension. Only posterior MTG lesions produced an impairment even for the simplest test sentences used, irrespective of syntactic complexity. A similar association between posterior inferior temporal lesions and impaired comprehension has also been reported by Peelle ( ) in a study of semantic dementia patients. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether impairments are in word-form recognition or in the form-to-meaning mapping. \n\nHowever, other studies that assess lesions associated with progressive comprehension impairments in semantic dementia patients ( ;  ), or that use a range of aetiologies (Tyler   et al  .  , ) would suggest a more anterior locus of the representations that support single word comprehension. For example, the speed with which patients respond in lexical decision is predicted by lesions in antero-lateral regions of the temporal lobe including the temporal pole ( ), as is a measure of semantic priming ( ). Further evidence for an association between damage to anterior temporal regions and deficits in the recognition of words and other familiar stimuli comes from studies of patients with multimodal semantic impairments following the temporal lobe variant of fronto-temporal dementia (semantic dementia). These patients suffer from a progressive, degenerative disorder that leads to significantly impaired semantic knowledge whether accessed from speech, writing or pictures and probed using forced choice, naming, drawing or generation tasks ( ). Voxel-based analysis methods have shown that cortical degeneration ( ;  ) and hypometabolism ( ;  ) in anterior temporal regions surrounding the temporal pole is most clearly associated with the degree of semantic impairment observed. \n\nAt present, it is unclear how we are to reconcile results suggesting that lesions to two distinct regions of the temporal lobe can both produce impairments of word recognition in patient populations. One plausible interpretation is that both anterior and posterior temporal regions contribute to successful recognition of familiar words in different ways. For example, Patterson, Rogers and others ( ;  ) suggest that the anterior temporal lobe forms a semantic hub that binds together neurally distributed representations of perceptual and conceptual features stored in more posterior regions. One speculative extension of this proposal in the context of the CLS account is to suggest that anterior temporal regions lesioned in semantic dementia provide input to the hippocampus. It might therefore be that anterior temporal lesions lead to a progressive decline in comprehension because damage impairs the ability to acquire new representations, and that these processes are also required if knowledge of familiar words is to be retained. Further investigation of word learning in these populations would be valuable. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of word and pseudoword responses in brain imaging \n  \nGiven this uncertainty concerning the role of anterior and posterior temporal lobe regions in the recognition of familiar words it is clear that functional imaging can provide important additional evidence concerning the cortical systems supporting word recognition. We therefore report a meta-analysis of published PET and fMRI studies that include a direct contrast between spoken words and pseudowords. We use an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method to derive a statistical map of the brain regions in which activation differences between words and pseudowords are expected ( ). This procedure is implemented in software [GingerALE v1.1 from  ] that incorporates a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons ( ). We limited our coverage to studies that (i) report activation foci in a standard coordinate space (either the Talairach Atlas or the MNI152 average brain, see  ) and (ii) conduct random-effects analyses of activation maps collected from groups of healthy adult participants. \n\nWe analysed all PET/fMRI studies of spoken word recognition that report the contrast between familiar words and phonologically well-formed, clearly spoken pseudowords in either direction. That is, we assessed regions involved in representing familiar items (responding more strongly to words) and regions that contribute to perception of pseudowords (responding more to pseudowords). This focus on the word/pseudoword contrast excludes studies in which non-word stimuli were physically distorted/degraded, or unintelligible versions of spoken words (e.g.  ), or non-linguistic stimuli (tones or similar,  ). Since our goal was to assess neural representations of familiar words, rather than systems that are differentially engaged by task-specific processes for words and pseudowords, we also excluded studies in which the word/non-word contrast was confounded by task differences (such as the studies reviewed in  ). Following these exclusions, 11 studies reporting a direct contrast between responses to spoken words and pseudowords remained, as summarized in  . Since certain of these studies included multiple contrasts, we focus our meta-analysis on main effects of lexicality, averaging over stimulus and task manipulations as appropriate. Where the results permitted (e.g.  ;  ) we excluded conditions in which participants were exposed to certain pseudowords before scanning. \n  \nStudies included in the meta-analysis. Those labelled asterisk (*) report peak activations for the Talairach & Tournaux (1988) brain atlas and have been transformed into the MNI152 average brain for analysis and reporting. \n  \nAll peak coordinates reported in the papers listed in   were included in the meta-analysis. Those studies labelled with asterisks (*) in   report activation foci in the space defined by the Talairach atlas and were converted into MNI space using the conversion routine supplied with the GingerALE software (see  ). In computing ALE maps for the word > pseudoword (w > p) and pseudoword > word (  p   > w) contrasts, we used a smoothing kernel with a full-width half maximum of 10 mm, and computed 5000 permutations in assessing the statistical significance of the resulting ALE map. Applying a statistical threshold of FDR   q   < 0.05 resulted in corrected statistical thresholds of   p   < 0.0038 for w > p and   p   < 0.0036 for   p   > w. Only clusters of voxels that exceeded a minimum cluster volume of 100 mm  are reported. \n\nIn describing the pattern of differential responses observed for words and pseudowords we will focus on responses in left hemisphere regions that as reviewed previously have been argued to be critical for the comprehension of spoken language (see \u00a72 and   a  ). We begin by describing the elevated responses observed for pseudowords shown in red in   a  \u2013  c   and  . These provide putative neural correlates of phonological-encoding processes that are challenged during the initial processing of unfamiliar spoken items and that may therefore contribute to initial encoding of pseudowords in conjunction with medial temporal regions. \n  \nActivation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) map derived from 97 peak voxels from 11 functional imaging studies comparing neural responses to spoken words and pseudowords. ALE maps are thresholded at   p   < 0.05 FDR corrected, and only clusters larger than 100 mm  are shown. Additional activation for pseudowords compared with words (red) and words compared with pseudowords (blue) is shown (  a  ) rendered onto the left hemisphere, (  b  ) displayed on an axial and (  c  ) multiple sagittal slices of the MNI canonical brain (  z   and   x   coordinates as shown). Note inferior temporal and fusiform activation for word >pseudoword (circled in orange) is largely hidden in the rendering but apparent on the axial slice and sagittal slices   x   = \u221248, \u221240 and \u221232. (  d  ,  e  ) Response profiles showing predicted changes in neural responses owing to familarization with pseudowords: (  d  ) Within regions that initially show an additional response to pseudowords (red in   a  \u2013  c  , e.g. STG, posterior inferior frontal gyrus). For these regions we predict a diminished response to pseudowords after training. (  d  ) Predicted response within regions that show an additional response to real words (anterior MTG, anterior fusiform, supramarginal gyrus, blue in   a  \u2013  c  ), we predict an increased response to pseudowords following training. (  f  ) fMRI responses in a region of the STG overlapping with areas shown in red in   a  \u2013  c   (replotted from  ). An equivalent, additional response to pseudowords was seen for items that were untrained at the time of scanning or trained but not consolidated (i.e. learned on the same day as scanning). However, there was a significant lexicality by consolidation interaction with a reduced response to pseudowords that were trained and consolidated (i.e. learned on the day before scanning). \n    \nActivation likelihood estimation results for 29 peak voxels in studies reporting a greater neural response to spoken pseudowords than words (shown in red in  ). Results thresholded at   p   < 0.05 FDR corrected, and with clusters greater than 100 mm  reported. Entries shown in bold are cluster summary statistics (including centre of mass and volume), entries in plain type show local maxima. \n  \nIn the superior portion of the left temporal lobe we see two distinct clusters that show an additional response to spoken pseudowords compared with real words. These clusters are located posterior and anterior to Heschl's Gyrus (in planum polare and planum temporale, respectively) extending into adjacent regions of the superior temporal gyrus. These clusters fall squarely within the dorsal and ventral speech processing pathways suggested to radiate out of primary auditory regions ( ; Hickok & Poeppel  ,  ;  ). There is good agreement between these various accounts that the dorsal-going pathway, running into the posterior temporal lobe and on to inferior parietal regions serves to map heard speech onto inferior frontal regions involved in generating the phonological representations required for articulation. It is therefore of interest that we observe an elevated response to pseudowords in left inferior frontal (opercularis) and premotor regions that putatively form part of the articulatory network identified by   and  . A number of other regions that have been associated with mapping heard speech onto motoric responses also appear in this meta-analysis include the insula ( ), supplementary motor area and cerebellum. The close proximity of the dorsal superior temporal cluster to primary auditory regions would suggest that this region contributes to sub-lexical processing of speech, consistent with their elevated response for pseudowords. Convergent evidence for this interpretation comes from functional imaging studies that ascribe phonological functions to these posterior temporal regions. For example, fMRI has shown that the magnitude of the posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) response is correlated with speech intelligibility yet sensitive to acoustically distinct forms of speech distortion ( ). Well-controlled speech/non-speech comparisons also produce posterior STG responses ( ;  ;  ) as do studies that contrast neural responses to phonological and acoustic changes to spoken syllables ( ;  ;  ). \n\nIn considering the function and organization of the ventral pathway for speech processing, there is rather more disagreement between the different accounts reviewed here. Some authors ( ;  ) have proposed that this anterior pathway in the superior temporal lobe regions contributes to identification of familiar spoken words, whereas others (Hickok & Poeppel  ,  ) have focused on posterior inferior temporal pathways as being critically involved in mapping heard speech on to lexical and semantic representations. While neither account makes specific predictions concerning neural responses to pseudowords, it is of interest that the elevated response to pseudowords in the anterior superior temporal lobe is clearly in front of primary auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus and planum polare. Our observation of an elevated response to pseudowords in these anterior auditory fields appears most clearly in line with accounts proposing that these regions contribute to echoic representations of speech (cf.  ;  ), although other authors have proposed a role for these regions in syntactic or combinatorial language processes ( ;  ;  ). Further data on the response of this portion of the anterior superior temporal gyrus to pseudowords would be valuable. \n\nWe now turn to the meta-analysis of brain regions showing an elevated response to real words compared with pseudowords, displayed in blue in   a  \u2013  c  , and summarized in  . These regions include neural substrates for cognitive processes that are uniquely available for real words such as making contact with stored representations of familiar phonological forms and initial access to associated word meanings (though as is apparent in  , not all of the studies included in the meta-analysis used tasks that specifically required either lexical or semantic processing). In line with the dual-route accounts described earlier, we see additional activation for spoken words in temporal lobe regions extending both anterior and posterior from those activations that were reported for the pseudoword contrast. We see a large cluster in the anterior STG and MTG extending towards the temporal pole, as well as a large posterior temporal cluster extending from the posterior MTG/STG into the inferior parietal lobe including the supramarginal gyrus. The spatial organization of these anterior and posterior temporal activations is consistent with the proposal that activations for real words are at a higher level of abstraction along anterior and posterior speech-processing pathways than those seen in the reverse contrast. Such findings parallel the results of a recent fMRI study using visual words and pseudowords in which familiar lexical items evoked activation at \u2018higher\u2019 levels of the ventral visual processing stream ( ). Similarly, we would suggest that the spatial position of these activations is consistent with a hierarchical account proposed on the basis of functional imaging data by (Davis & Johnsrude  ,  ). Preferential responses to pseudowords lead to focal activation of phonological processes, whereas real words lead to focal activation of higher level, lexical representations. One complexity of the present results is that additional activation for real words is observed in all three temporal lobe pathways shown in   a  . While we do not have sufficient space here to review evidence for dissociations among these systems, these findings illustrate that representations of familiar words are to be found in multiple cortical systems, consistent with computational accounts such as the distributed cohort model in which both phonological and semantic representations can be considered part of the lexical system (  b  ). \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation results for 68 peak voxels in studies reporting a greater neural response to spoken words than pseudowords (shown in blue in  ). Results thresholded at   p   < 0.05 FDR corrected, and with clusters greater than 100 mm  reported. Entries shown in bold are cluster summary statistics (centre of mass and volume), entries in plain type show local maxima. \n  \n\n### Imaging cortical correlates of word learning \n  \nThe differential cortical responses to words and pseudowords reviewed above allow us to recast the critical experimental questions of word learning studies in neural terms. What learning processes are required to change neural response to pseudowords into responses that resemble real words? A number of studies have shown changes in the magnitude of neural responses to pseudowords following repeated presentation, and have linked these response changes to behavioural improvements and hence word learning. However, we would argue that response changes owing to learning should at least partially cancel response differences between pre-existing words and entirely novel pseudowords if we are to infer that cortical representations of newly learned items have become word-like. \n\nFor the neural response to a pseudoword to become fully word-like requires two opposite changes following familiarization: response decreases in regions that respond more to pseudowords, and response increases in regions that respond preferentially to familiar words. The brain regions that show these changes and the direction of observed effects can thus be predicted from that seen for comparisons of words and pseudowords on initial presentation. The two interaction profiles depicted in   d  ,  e   therefore provide specific hypotheses concerning the cortical correlates of word learning. This section of the paper will review functional imaging studies that assess neural responses to pseudoword stimuli before, during and after familiarization with a view to testing for either of these two interactions. Building on behavioural evidence for offline consolidation, we predict that the emergence of robust, cortical representations of newly learned words requires not just initial familiarization, but also a period of offline consolidation. Evidence that these response changes can occur more rapidly has the potential to challenge the CLS account. \n\nOne study that tested for word-like changes to neural responses to pseudowords was reported by  . They used event-related fMRI to measure neural responses during lexical decisions to spoken words and pseudowords, half of which were presented twice during scanning. Neural responses showed elevated responses to familiar words in many of the temporal lobe regions shown in the meta-analysis ( ). Critically, however, response differences between words and pseudowords were unaltered by stimulus repetition\u2014neither of the interactions between stimulus repetition/familiarization and lexicality depicted in   d  ,  e   were significant in the fMRI data. This was not because of the lack of any effect of stimulus repetition on neural responses. Response increases for repeated presentations were seen in dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal regions, lateral parietal regions and the precuneus. These activation increases partially overlapped with brain regions showing an increased response to familiar words (e.g. in the parietal lobe), however, these regions did not show the lexicality by repetition interaction depicted in   e   but rather words and pseudowords showed an equivalent response increased, consistent with memory processes recruited for both classes of items. Response reductions for repeated items were observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the SMA and posterior inferior temporal gyrus, though once more these were of equivalent magnitude for words and pseudowords (unlike the profile in   d  ). Correlational analyses showed that reduced responses in inferior frontal and motor regions were correlated with the trial-by-trial magnitude of behavioural priming, suggesting that the expression of the repetition priming effect is linked with neural systems involved in decision-making and response execution (cf.  ). Despite the presence of a lexicality by repetition interaction in behaviour, neural responses showed no evidence for the emergence of word-like representations for repeated pseudowords. \n\nIn contrast to the study reported by Orfanidou, other studies that explore how neural responses change as a result of familiarization with pseudowords have claimed cortical correlates of word learning. However, we must be careful to distinguish effects of familiarization from the task-based repetition effects that were documented by  . Studies that only assess familiarization effects for pseudowords cannot differentiate between emerging cortical representations of newly learned words as distinct from effects of stimulus repetition. For instance,   report that neural responses in an anterior region of the fusiform showed a greater decline over five repetitions of consistent word-picture pairings than for inconsistent word-picture pairings. Our meta-analysis shows that this fusiform region ordinarily shows an increased response for words compared with pseudowords. Pseudoword training should have increased responses to trained items and hence the response reductions shown by Breitenstein make the neural response to familiarized pseudowords less, not more, word-like. Note that this observation does not negate any of the conclusions of the Breitenstein study concerning the contribution that the fusiform in conjunction with the hippocampus makes to the initial acquisition of word-picture associations. \n\nTwo other event-related fMRI studies have similarly shown response reductions to repetitions of spoken pseudowords ( ;  ). Both studies show that multiple presentations of pseudowords led to a reduced neural response within brain regions shown in our meta-analysis to produce an elevated response to pseudowords (the STG, premotor cortex and SMA in  ; left STS, motor cortex and cerebellum in  ). That both these studies show a reduced response in posterior superior temporal regions is encouraging since it suggests that the change in pseudoword responses is in the correct direction to reduce the response difference between pseudowords and words (the interaction depicted in   d  ). However, neither study measured the effect of stimulus repetition for familiar words and so cannot detect interactions that provide evidence for word-like neural responses. \n\nCritical for the interpretation of these event-related fMRI studies are the findings of two PET studies that did compare the effect of stimulus repetition on words and pseudowords ( ;  ). Both studies show equivalent repetition suppression in the STG when spoken words and pseudowords are presented repeatedly prior to scanning ( ), or during scanning ( ). Hence, in this study there is no lexicality by repetition interaction in either the posterior STG ( ) or the anterior STG ( ). It therefore seems that had words been included in the fMRI studies of Rauschecker and Graves, then the required lexicality by repetition interaction would be absent and a main effect of repetition observed (cf.  ). One further finding from the   study is that low phonotactic frequency non-words did not show the same response decrease owing to familiarization as familiar words and high-phonotactic frequency non-words. This might suggest that cortical correlates of rapid response learning are limited to items that are either familiar or very similar to familiar words. Such a finding is consistent with the Distributed Cohort Model, in which the ability to generalize to novel pseudowords is determined by the degree of similarity to pre-existing words. It is precisely for these atypical, low-phonotactic frequency non-words that the model would struggle to generate an appropriate phonological representation, preventing cortical learning processes from producing short-term task-based repetition priming. \n\nOne fMRI study that both tested for a familiarity by repetition interaction and ruled out task repetition was presented by Gagnepain and colleagues ( ). In this event-related fMRI study, participants made lexical decisions to acoustically degraded spoken words and pseudowords of which 50 per cent had been presented previously for a phoneme decision task. Gagnepain observed a symmetrical interaction between lexicality and stimulus repetition with responses in left posterior STG and right peri-auditory areas, i.e. a reduced response for second presentations of words, and an enhanced response for second presentations of pseudowords. Thus, in the absence of a task-based explanation of response changes, repetition effects can differentiate words and pseudowords. Gagnepain and colleagues suggest that response increases for pseudowords reflect long-term encoding of previously unfamiliar items. However, these increases were observed in regions close to auditory cortex that showed an elevated response to pseudowords in our meta-analysis. This interaction serves to increase the neural response difference between pre-existing words and pseudowords, rather than decreasing this effect as predicted by   d  . Thus, the reactivation of recently acquired pseudoword representations has the opposite effect on measured neural activity to the difference between familiar words and unfamiliar pseudowords. This interaction profile is reminiscent of that observed in occipital and posterior fusiform regions in studies of neural repetition for written words ( ) and faces (Henson   et al  .  ,  ), which similarly differentiate familiar and unfamiliar items. In each of these studies, repetition effects for unfamiliar items are either absent, or do not appropriately overlap with regions that show an elevated response to familiar items. \n\nIn summary, then, existing studies have failed to provide a convincing demonstration that repeated presentation of spoken pseudowords can lead to the emergence of word-like cortical responses over the time span of a typical functional imaging experiment. While it is difficult to argue from a null effect, particularly for a predicted interaction, it is striking that none of these PET and fMRI studies have satisfied the critical predictions depicted in   d  ,  e   that interactions between lexicality and familiarization should overlap with response differences between words and pseudowords. The lack of a significant interaction, however, is directly predicted by the CLS account which proposes that short-term stimulus repetition alone is insufficient to produce stable, task-independent cortical representations of newly learnt pseudowords. Behavioural results reviewed previously in this paper would instead suggest that prior presentation and a sleep-associated consolidation process is necessary for newly learned words to have an equivalent lexical status to familiar words. Consequently, neural effects of a consolidation period that included sleep were assessed in an fMRI study reported by  . \n\nLike certain other PET and fMRI studies reviewed previously, Davis and colleagues tested for interactions between prior familiarization and lexicality. Since two different tasks were used in training and testing (phoneme monitoring and gap-detection, respectively;  ;  ), task-based response learning could not account for effects of training on neural responses. The experimental design used three matched sets of words and pseudowords, two of which were familiarized prior to scanning. One set of words and pseudowords was familiarized on the day before scanning (hence subject to overnight consolidation), another group of items was familiarized around 4 h before scanning (learned but not consolidated) and a third group presented only in the scanner (untrained controls). This experimental design allows a test of interactions that reflect the impact of initial learning alone and the additional effect of an overnight delay between training and testing on response differences between words and pseudowords. The design does not allow any effects found to be necessarily associated with sleep as opposed to an extended period of consolidation awake. However, given the behavioural data reviewed previously ( ) and the fact that the same-day training also included ample time for awake consolidation (4 h), sleep is likely to be the principal driver of neocortical changes observed in the comparison of items learnt on the same or previous day to scanning. Comparison of untrained words and pseudowords also permitted an assessment of simple lexicality effects as shown in the meta-analysis. However, perhaps because the tasks used depend on processing the surface form of speech, elevated responses were observed for pseudowords compared with words and not vice versa. We will discuss in the concluding section the implications of the lack of an elevated, word-like response to pseudowords following training and consolidation. \n\nFor the untrained items, Davis   et al  . found an elevated response to pseudowords in the STG (anterior and posterior), and left cerebellum similar to those shown in   (results included in the meta-analysis). Consistent with the findings of  , no interaction between same-day familiarization and lexicality was shown. That is, an overlapping set of regions showed an elevated response to pseudowords compared with words when these items had been extensively trained in the hours prior to scanning. Indeed, for this pseudoword versus word contrast, an elevated response to pseudowords occurred in a more extensive phonological network including a bilateral region of the motor cortex and the left SMA (though changes between untrained and trained items were not statistically significant). What is striking, however, is that the same comparison between pseudowords and words did not reach whole-brain corrected significance for items trained on the day prior to scanning. Indeed, we saw a significant consolidation by lexicality interaction in the STG, motor cortex and right cerebellum (  f  ). As is apparent, the critical interaction was between words and pseudowords trained with overnight consolidation and items trained and tested on the same day (hence not subject to consolidation). Thus, if the criterion for the emergence of a stable lexical representation is a significant reduction in the elevated response to a trained pseudoword, then participants require both initial training and offline consolidation (in this case over 24 h between training and scanning) for learning to impact on cortical responses. This finding is entirely predicted by a CLS account in which cortical learning requires offline consolidation. \n\nTo be clear, this result does not imply that all neural correlates of word learning require overnight consolidation. We have already reviewed other results from the Davis   et al  . study showing that the degree to which participants become familiar with pseudowords that were presented for the first time during scanning is associated with the activation and subsequent decline in hippocampal responses (cf.  ). These data suggest that the role of the hippocampus in word learning appears confined to the initial acquisition of novel pseudowords, consistent with the CLS account. In the light of certain neuroimaging studies reviewed here ( ;  ;  ) that show effects of repetition priming on neural responses to pseudowords, we must add a further significant caveat. These studies provide evidence for rapid neocortical learning that is involved in the acquisition and expression of stimulus-response associations ( ). This form of learning can produce significant facilitation of behavioural and cortical responses to spoken pseudowords\u2014though only if they are similar to existing words (cf.  ). If response learning applies to spoken words and pseudowords, then these effects can be observed for both items ( ). However, differential repetition priming for words and pseudowords can more often be observed with greater priming for familiar words ( ). In these experiments, pseudoword priming effects are often in the wrong direction to create more word-like cortical responses ( ). We would contend, therefore, that rapid, response-based learning processes are limited to tuning of existing representations, and are (on their own) insufficient to establish cortical representations of new spoken words. In the CLS account there are limits to rapid cortical learning so as to avoid the catastrophic interference present in neural network simulations. Response-based learning processes cannot be invoked to explain the overnight consolidation effects that we have observed in our functional imaging study ( ). Nor can task-based repetition priming effects explain the effect of overnight consolidation on the emergence of lexical competition in behavioural studies that were reviewed in \u00a73. In all these studies, both the stimuli presented, and the responses measured differ between training and testing. \n\nThis separation of rapid stimulus-response learning (that can be achieved by cortical mechanisms without consolidation) and slower cortical learning produced by hippocampal encoding and offline consolidation has the potential to explain certain puzzling observations from the literature on word learning in amnesic patients. A number of studies suggest that newly acquired semantic knowledge in this population is to some extent rote-learned and inflexible. For instance, whereas control participants taught the phrase \u2018venom-caused illness\u2019 could retrieve the correct final word when cued by synonyms (e.g. \u2018poison-caused\u2026\u2019, or \u2018venom-induced\u2026\u2019) an amnesic patient EP failed to respond correctly unless the exact same words were used to cue the knowledge ( ). Similarly, a developmental amnesic patient Jon could acquire new semantic/factual knowledge, but required many more repetitions than control participants ( ). These data might suggest that isolated neocortical learning mechanisms responsible are limited to supporting stimulus-response association of whole forms. Hence, there may be important benefits that hippocampal learning and overnight consolidation provide in the non-damaged brain. This two-stage learning process supports flexible and generalizable knowledge more effectively than rote or piecemeal learning using neocortical systems alone. \n\n\n\n## Discussion and future directions \n  \nIn this paper we have presented a cognitively and neuroanatomically informed account of word learning, grounded in principles that are well-established for learning other domains of knowledge. Our CLS account, while novel to the domain of word processing, can therefore draw on extensive empirical support for complementary hippocampal and neocortical learning systems in other domains, as well as evidence that sleep plays a specific role in the consolidation and unification of newly acquired neural representations in these two systems. Given the obvious debt that our CLS account owes to pre-existing accounts of memory formation, we will begin by making a few remarks concerning the value to memory theory more generally of evidence from the study of word learning. We will then consider some unanswered questions concerning the CLS account of word learning that should be pursued in further empirical research. \n\n### What can memory theory gain from considering word learning? \n  \nWord learning is a domain in which adult participants have a large and relatively uniform body of knowledge\u2014there is a core vocabulary that is shared by all English speakers. Furthermore, the cognitive abilities and cortical processes that support our ability to recognize, understand and produce familiar words are (as this review illustrates) relatively well understood. Yet, monolingual adults continue to add to their vocabulary (e.g. \u2018blog\u2019), an ability that is also critical for successful second language learning. For these reasons, we suggest that word learning is an ideal subject area in which to explore interactions between systems that support pre-existing knowledge and new learning, in a domain that provides striking real-world application. \n\nWord learning also provides clear examples of the multiple forms of knowledge that are critical for successful performance. Word representations are jointly perceptual (in systems involved in recognizing words), procedural (in motor systems for producing words) and semantic (in systems representing word meaning). Representations in each of these linked systems must be robust and able to generalize from individual experiences to novel input. For instance, we must recognize familiar words spoken by unfamiliar voices or establish the meaning of familiar words in unfamiliar contexts. These properties are ably demonstrated by neural network models (e.g.  ) that are subject to computational limitations typical of systems trained with distributed learning algorithms. The CLS account therefore proposes that the acquisition of distributed word representations should depend on medial temporal lobe systems that encode episodic representations of the form and meaning of novel words. \n\nEmpirical evidence concerning the nature of these interactions between episodic and perceptual/procedural memories of spoken words therefore provides a natural interpretation within CLS accounts. One point of view on complementary learning systems has considered perceptual/procedural and episodic learning to be distinct processes that operate on different types of information and that are probed using different sorts of test (e.g.  ). Rather, we would contend that most ecologically valid forms of learning exemplify more than one single type of knowledge, and are hence not embodied in any single system. Word learning provides examples of multiple forms of learning (perceptual, declarative and procedural) within a single domain and therefore provides a useful paradigm in which to assess dissociations and interactions among these different systems. \n\n\n### Unanswered questions for the CLS account of word learning \n  \nAs the current review illustrates, existing evidence from neuropsychology and functional brain imaging concerning neural systems involved in word learning are largely consistent with the CLS account proposed here. However, more specific empirical tests of the predictions of the CLS account remain to be conducted. In particular, it should be noted that those behavioural data that most clearly show effects of overnight consolidation test knowledge of the form of spoken words and not their meaning (speeded repetition tasks, e.g.  ; resolution of lexical competition, cf.  ). We have argued that these data can be understood in terms of consolidation processes that achieve optimal, probabilistic processing of perceptual input and integration of new knowledge with existing representations. Although the role of consolidation in supporting efficient perceptual processing is relatively well understood, it is less clear whether other aspects of word learning (such as the acquisition of semantics) are also subject to overnight consolidation. As yet there is limited behavioural evidence concerning the long-term acquisition of representations of word meaning (e.g.  ) and no empirical demonstration that semantic representations are subject to overnight consolidation. From a neuroscientific perspective we can ask whether all of the cortical systems that contribute to word knowledge (depicted in figures\u00a0  and  ) show an equivalent dependence on overnight consolidation; or whether it is only representations of perceptual form (in superior temporal regions), and associated motor representations (in the precentral gyrus and right cerebellum) that show consolidation. The results of the fMRI study reported by   would support this second conclusion but further empirical investigation would be helpful. \n\nA further set of empirical questions concern the finding that recognition of lexical neighbours of newly learned words is altered by overnight, sleep-associated consolidation ( ;  ). Although these results are striking, they fall short of showing a causal link between sleep and consolidation. Only by making direct interventions to sleep architecture in individual participants can we show that it is sleep itself (rather than some other state ordinarily associated with sleep) that is necessary for consolidation. With this result in hand, further experiments could then ask what features of sleep are necessary for consolidation. The existing literature on motor learning provides evidence to link consolidation to specific sleep stages (REM sleep,  ) and specific physiological processes ( ). Conversely, declarative, episodic memories such as word-pair associations appear to be consolidated during stage 2 slow-wave sleep, presumably by the spindles and k-complexes that predominate in EEG signals recording during this sleep stage ( ;  ). Such findings naturally raise the question of which of these different sleep stages is associated with consolidation of word form knowledge, or indeed whether multiple sleep phases are required for consolidation of word representations that are both declarative and procedural ( ). \n\nAlthough we believe that existing brain imaging data on word learning are consistent with the CLS account, there has been only limited evidence for some of our most specific neural predictions. For instance, we reviewed evidence for hippocampal involvement during initial encoding (indexed by elevated fMRI activity), but so far there is little data to show how hippocampal and neocortical representations are coupled. Conversely, we have seen that overnight consolidation appears to reduce elevated cortical responses for pseudowords. However, we have not yet provided any evidence that either initial learning or overnight consolidation can produce an elevated response to pseudowords as a consequence of training. One possible explanation of this finding is that elevated responses to real words reflect neural correlates of semantic representations that were not part of the training procedure used in the study of  . Alternatively, it might be that more than a single day of training and overnight consolidation is required to increase the cortical response to new spoken pseudowords in areas that respond to familiar words. These and other questions are currently being addressed by follow-up functional imaging studies. A further set of questions concerns the nature of the neural connections that support consolidated representations of learned words. The CLS account predicts stronger connections within the cortical network and reduced connections with hippocampal representations for consolidated words. Further, more detailed evidence concerning the nature of neural interactions between neocortical and medial temporal systems at different stages during learning and at different time points after learning would therefore be a valuable test of the CLS account. \n\nOne final point to be addressed in future work concerns the relationship between neural systems that support short-term representations of pseudowords (such as in phonological working memory tasks, or that support repetition priming of pseudowords) and long-term acquisition. Behavioural evidence would suggest that phonological short-term memory (pSTM) capacity predicts vocabulary acquisition abilities both in children, and brain-injured adults ( ). Imaging studies of auditory-verbal short-term memory have highlighted superior temporal and inferior parietal regions that contribute to echoic and rehearsal-based aspects of pSTM, respectively ( ). However, the CLS account predicts that an additional consolidation process is required to turn these short-term representations into long-term lexical knowledge. Functional imaging tests of neural overlap between pSTM and long-term lexical learning would therefore provide an important bridge between the CLS account, and other, pre-existing data concerning the role of pSTM in word learning. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe have presented an integrative account of the acquisition and recognition of spoken words that combines CLS theory with the existing computational and neuroanatomical accounts of word recognition. A range of behavioural, neuropsychological and functional imaging evidence points towards differential contributions of medial temporal and neocortical systems to rapid initial acquisition and long-term consolidation of spoken words, respectively. Although this account remains under-explored in the domain of word learning there a number of parallels that we have highlighted between word learning and other memory domains. Thus, we believe that the CLS account can provide a firm foundation for cognitive and neuroscientific explorations of processes that are fundamental to language acquisition and processing in adults and infants alike. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2846311, "text_md5": "1fed08e70ee17f70add1bf0f93c69c3b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 40], "journal": [41, 75], "publication_year": [77, 81], "title": [92, 173], "keywords": [187, 244], "abstract": [257, 1758], "body": [1767, 115299]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 19933145, "doi": "10.1098/rstb.2009.0111", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846311", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2846311"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846311\">2846311</a>", "list_title": "PMC2846311  A complementary systems account of word learning: neural and behavioural evidence"}

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment option for particular clinical conditions, such as catatonic symptoms, suicidality or acute symptoms [ ]. In addition, accumulating evidence supports the use of ECT for medication-resistant patients with SZ [ ]. A Cochrane review indicated that treatment with ECT significantly results in clinical improvement compared with placebo or sham ECT [ ]. A meta-analysis suggests that ECT may represent an effective clozapine augmentation strategy in medication-resistant cases [ ]. Recently, findings from a growing number of studies have suggested that ECT combined with antipsychotic medication may be considered an option for patients with SZ who show limited response to medication alone [ ]. \n\nAlthough the efficacy of ECT has been demonstrated in clinical use, the therapeutic mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. One possible mechanism is neuroplasticity. This hypothesis is supported by findings from animal studies, indicating that electroconvulsive seizures (the analogy of ECT in animal models) affect many neuroplastic processes, including neurogenesis [ ,  ], synaptogenesis [ ], angiogenesis [ ], gliogenesis [ ] and other neuronal/axonal changes [ ,  ]. Studies in humans have also reported the effects of ECT on neuroplasticity, including changes in hippocampal/amygdala volumes [ ] and increases in the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [ ]. In addition to neuroplasticity, several clinical studies have suggested that ECT may enhance dopamine D  receptor efficacy [ ]. Although the mechanism of ECT is complex, increasing evidence suggests that the reorganization of brain structure or connectivity by ECT may represent one of the mechanisms [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nNeuroimaging is a robust technology and has recently been widely used to investigate the pathological mechanisms in the SZ brain [ ]. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) have revealed abnormalities in a multitude of regions and networks in SZ [ - ]. Structural morphometry studies showed widespread grey matter atrophy in cortical and subcortical regions, including the hippocampus, insula, thalamus, temporal and frontal lobes, in patients with SZ [ ,  ]. Accumulating fMRI studies also identified aberrant functional connectivity (FC) among these regions [ - ], suggesting that psychotic syndromes in SZ may be related to disturbances in the cortico-cortical (subcortico-cortical) systems at the neuroimaging level [ ]. These findings support a dysconnectivity hypothesis during the neural developmental process that has been demonstrated to be highly relevant to SZ neuropathology [ ]. The dysconnectivity hypothesis posits that inefficient or ineffective interaction within large-scale functional networks is one of the indicators in the neuropathology of SZ [ ]. \n\nTo our knowledge, there is no review focusing on sMRI and fMRI changes in SZ patients following ECT. In this mini-review, we reported summaries of MRI studies that investigated brain changes due to ECT in patients with SZ from the following aspects: (1) ECT-induced structural changes in sMRI; (2) ECT-induced functional changes by fMRI; and (3) whether these changes correlate with symptom remission. An additional aim was to examine whether ECT outcomes can be predicted based on pre-ECT MRI. Finally, we sought to clarify some brain mechanisms of ECT. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nA systematic review of the international literature was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PRISMA flowchart, Fig.    ) [ ]. Studies were selected through a standard search of the bibliographic search engines PubMed and Medline using the following medical subject headings (MeSH): (electroconvulsive therapy OR ECT) AND (schizophrenia) AND (MRI OR fMRI OR DTI OR DWI). The research focused on papers published up to 30 October 2020. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ECT-treated subjects were diagnosed with SZ; (2) SZ patients were scanned by sMRI or fMRI; (3) publications that were full-text articles (  i.e.  , no abstracts, conference reports, or other publication types); (4) articles were written in English. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did not include patients with SZ who treated by ECT; (2) studies that did not use sMRI or fMRI or DTI; (3) articles that were reviews or case reports. Two researchers (YJ and CL) independently reviewed full-text articles to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review and discussed inconsistencies until consensus was obtained. The reference lists of the included papers were manually examined to increase the number of studies. Two researchers (YJ and HH) worked independently to extract study details, including demographics of participants, clinical information, ECT parameters (Table    ), MRI scanning information, image processing method and MRI main findings (Table    ). A third researcher (CL) reviewed the data extraction and resolved conflicts. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nFig. (   ) shows the procedure for study selection, which yielded 12 MRI studies comprising 4 with sMRI [ - ], 5 with fMRI [ - ] and 3 with multimodal MRI data [ - ]. Table     reports the demographics of the participants, clinical information and ECT parameters for each study. Table     describes the MRI scanning information, image processing method and summarized MRI main findings for each study. \n\n### Brain Structural MRI Changes Induced by ECT \n  \nTable     shows that five structural MRI studies investigated brain morphological changes before and after ECT intervention. Three studies used the data-driven method to investigate the voxel-wise grey matter (GM) volume changes within the whole brain [ ,  ,  ]. Two studies applied the region of interest (ROI) -driven method to examine the volume changes in specific regions (hippocampus and insula) [ ,  ]. All these studies show structural changes following ECT. \n\n#### Hippocampus \n  \nSeveral studies [ ,  ,  ,  ] have indicated ECT-induced volume changes in the hippocampus and its adjacent regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala, in SZ patients (Table    ). A consistent increase in hippocampal volume was noted in patients with SZ following ECT compared with baseline [ ,  ,  ,  ]. No studies have reported a reduced hippocampal volume after ECT. Consistent with the observation of increased volume in the hippocampus due to ECT, accumulated evidence has shown the same structural changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients undergoing ECT intervention [ ,  ,  ]. Thomann   et al.   [ ] and Wolf   et al.   [ ] investigated structural changes in GM volume using two different MRI analysis methods. Using source-based morphometry (SBM) analysis, they reported that the medial temporal lobe network showed a significant volume increase in two diagnostic groups of SZ and MDD after unilateral ECT [ ]. In another study [ ], GM volumes quantified by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were increased in the right anterior part of the hippocampus and right amygdala in both diagnostic groups following ECT. These findings suggested a shared mechanism of ECT action on hippocampal volume changes across clinical diagnoses. Recently, Wang   et al.   [ ] compared the longitudinal GM volume changes between the two groups of SZ patients. One patient group received a four-week bitemporal ECT series in addition to antipsychotic drugs, and the other group only received antipsychotic treatment. The GM volumes were analysed by VBM. The hippocampus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus exhibited increased volumes within ECT-treated patients, but a decrease amongst the patients treated only with antipsychotics. Based on the same dataset, Jiang   et al.   [ ] analysed hippocampal substructures using FreeSurfer (version 6.0,  ), another conventional tool to segment the hippocampus and estimate the volumes of subfields. The whole hippocampus was further segmented into twelve subfields for each hemisphere, including the hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1), CA3, CA4, hippocampal fissure, granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-MLDG), molecular layer, hippocampus-amyg- dala transition area (HATA) and fimbria. Statistical analyses revealed increased bilateral hippocampal whole volumes and certain subfields in SZ patients following ECT, which were not observed in patients treated exclusively with antipsychotics. These distinguished changes demonstrated that the increased hippocampal volume is the specific ECT effect rather than the effect of antipsychotic therapy. In total, neuroimaging findings provided strong evidence supporting the increased hippocampal volume induced by ECT, which is not dependent on stimulus site (unilateral or bilateral) or neuroimaging analytic methods. \n\n\n#### Insula \n  \nThree of the previously published studies reported increased volume in the insula in SZ after ECT (Table    ). Using VBM analysis on structural MRI, Thomann   et al.   [ ] and Wang   et al.   [ ] found an increased GM volume of the voxels within the right insula in SZ at post-ECT compared with pre-ECT. Jiang   et al.   [ ] functionally parcellated the bilateral insula into six subregions (  i.e.  , the bilateral dorsal anterior [dAIns], ventral anterior [vAIns] and posterior insula [PIns]) using K-means clustering on fMRI. The averaged GM volume in each subregion was extracted. The ECT-treated patients with SZ exhibited an increased GM volume in the bilateral PIns, whereas SZ patients treated exclusively with antipsychotics showed decreased GM volume compared with pretreatment volume. Volume changes in the whole insula were analysed, yielding results consistent with those noted in the PIns. \n\n\n#### Other Regions \n  \nIn addition to focusing on the hippocampus and insula, two studies using the whole brain data-driven method found structural changes in frontal and temporal regions in patients with SZ after ECT intervention. For example, Wolf   et al.   reported that the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exhibited a volume increase in SZ patients treated by ECT [ ]. Wang   et al.   found increased GM volumes in the right temporal pole and right superior temporal gyrus in SZ after ECT [ ]. \n\n\n\n### Brain Functional MRI Changes Induced by ECT \n  \nTable     shows that 8 functional MRI studies investigated ECT-induced brain functional changes. Three studies [ - ] used the data-driven method (independent component analysis [ICA] and global functional connectivity density [gFCD]) to investigate FC changes within the whole brain. Five studies applied the ROI-driven method (  i.e.  , seed-based FC) to examine the changes in FC in specific regions (hippocampus, amygdala, insula and thalamus) [ - ]. All these studies reported functional MRI changes following ECT. \n\n#### Default Mode Network \n  \nThe default mode network (DMN), which is composed of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), angular gyrus and medial temporal lobes, is involved in monitoring self-referential mental processes [ ]. Disruption of the DMN is associated with pathological processes in SZ [ - ]. Huang   et al.   [ ] applied gFCD, a data-driven graph-based measure of whole-brain FC, to quantify the centrality of the brain network voxelwise [ ]. Regions with high gFCD values have been previously reported to be functional network hubs that play prominent roles in cognitive, affective and sensory functions [ ]. Huang   et al.   found that compared with routine pharmacotherapy, SZ patients receiving 4 weeks of ECT plus antipsychotics exhibited increased gFCD within the DMN regions, including the left precuneus, ventral medial cortex and dorsal prefrontal cortex [ ]. Consistent with Huang   et al.  \u2019s study, Sambataro and colleagues used another data-driven method,   i.e.  , the ICA, to examine the functional network changes after ECT intervention [ ]. They also found increased IC loading in the MPFC in SZ patients following ECT [ ]. In addition, Li   et al.   found DMN FC changes (enhanced FC in the left PCC and reduced FC in the right precuneus) after ECT intervention [ ]. \n\n\n#### Salience Network \n  \nThe salience network (SN), which includes the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ), plays a crucial role in detecting, filtering and integrating salient signals from external and interoceptive environments [ ]. SN dysfunctions in SZ have been widely reported in previous studies [ ,  ,  ]. Jiang   et al.   found that compared to pharmacotherapy alone, SZ patients exhibited decreased FC between the insula and middle occipital gyrus as well as orbitofrontal cortex following ECT plus antipsychotic treatment [ ]. Consistent with Jiang   et al.  , Li   et al.   found decreased connectivity in the ACC after ECT intervention [ ]. This phenomenon was not observed in the SZ group treated with antipsychotics alone. \n\n\n#### Functional Connectivity with Hippocampus and Amygdala \n  \nUsing seed-based FC analysis with the right amygdala as the seed region, Thomann   et al.   found that right unilateral (RUL) ECT induced FC reductions between the right amygdala and cortical regions in the ipsilateral hemisphere, including the right TPJ, the right MPFC, the right DLFPC and bilateral posterior insula [ ]. In addition, RUL ECT increased the FC between the right amygdala and the hypothalamus. These researchers observed that these FC changes were not diagnosis-specific in SZ and MDD. Yang and colleagues also reported reduced FC between the right amygdala and left hippocampus after bitemporal ECT compared with pre-ECT [ ]. A recent study classified the 21 SZ patients who received ECT intervention into responders (n=10) and nonresponders (n=11), according to the 50% reduction ratio in Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores after the 4-week bitemporal ECT intervention [ ]. Comparisons of FC (seed at the hippocampus) longitudinal changes between ECT responders and nonresponders revealed that responders showed increased FC between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and regions within the DMN, whereas nonresponders exhibited decreased FC between the hippocampus and regions in the primary sensory network [ ]. \n\n\n#### Others \n  \nLi   et al.   also found increased FC in the temporal lobe network and frontal-parietal network as well as decreased FC in the language network after ECT intervention in SZ patients [ ]. In addition, Wang   et al.   reported that ECT induced increased FC between the right thalamus and right putamen and decreased FC between the thalamus and sensory cortex in SZ patients [ ]. \n\n\n\n### Correlation Between Brain Changes and Symptom Remission \n  \nAlthough several studies [ ,  ,  ,  ] reported that no significant correlation was observed between brain changes and clinical symptoms, some studies have found significant correlations between ECT-induced brain changes and symptom remissions after ECT intervention [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. For example, Wang   et al.   observed a significant positive correlation between the GM volume change in the right parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus and the reduction of positive symptoms [ ]. Jiang   et al.   also observed that volume increases in the hippocampal subfield (  i.e.  , left CA4) and FC between the left caudal hippocampus and right angular gyrus were associated with general psychopathology reductions [ ]. Yang   et al.   reported that the change in FC between the amygdala and hippocampus was positively correlated with a reduction in the PANSS total score [ ]. In addition to the hippocampus, the volume and FC changes in the posterior insula were correlated with PANSS reductions [ ]. Moreover, the left DLPFC network change was negatively associated with PANSS total score changes [ ]. \n\n\n### Predictive Performance for the ECT Outcomes using the Baseline MRI \n  \nThree of the published studies [ ,  ,  ] focused on predicting ECT outcomes using baseline MRI features. Xi   et al.   [ ] classified 57 SZ patients who received ECT combined with antipsychotics into 28 responders and 29 nonresponders. Based on the structural features from the VBM, they found that both the logistic regression model and support vector machine obtained great accuracies of 87.59% and 91.78%, respectively, in the validation dataset. Gong   et al.   [ ] used a multiparametric MRI-based radiomic model to extract the MRI features at baseline and then imported them to a support vector regression model, a machine learning technique, to predict a continuous improvement in symptoms after ECT (  i.e.  , PANSS total score reductions). They found that multimodal MRI features (including four structural MRI features from the left inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, left middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus and six diffusion MRI features from tracts connecting the frontal or temporal gyrus) predicted the ECT outcomes, as identified by a significant correlation between predicted and actual values of treatment response. In another work, Yang   et al.   found that FCs that were distributed within the orbital prefrontal cortex and temporal regions showed a predictive ability for ECT outcomes [ ]. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that explores brain structural and functional MRI changes in patients with SZ following ECT intervention. The main results of our study highlight that ECT induces an increase in volumes of the hippocampus and its adjacent regions (parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala) as well as the insula and frontotemporal regions. Regarding fMRI results, consistent improvement in FC within the DMN regions (MPFC and PCC) and a reduction in FC between the SN and other brain regions were noted. Some changes in FC between the hippocampus and amygdala and cortical regions are not consistent in terms of FC increases or decreases. In addition, there seemed to be some changes in FC in other networks, such as the temporal lobe network, frontal-parietal network and language network, as well as the thalamic-cortical/subcortical network. Moreover, ECT-related changes in the hippocampus/amygdala and insula were significantly correlated with ECT outcomes (  i.e.  , PANSS score reductions). Finally, the pre-ECT MRI features seem to be predictive of response to treatment. However, these results should be further identified, given the limited sample size for prediction. \n\n### Structural Plasticity \n  \nWe found that structural changes after ECT intervention are not widely distributed in the brain but are localized in specific regions that are thought to be highly correlated with the pathophysiologic characteristics of SZ. Volume reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, insula and frontal and temporal lobes in SZ have been demonstrated in prior studies [ ,  ]. One possible explanation for volumetric increases is neuroplasticity. Deficits in neuroplasticity have long been documented in SZ and other psychiatric disorders [ ]. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that neurogenesis [ ,  ], synaptogenesis [ ], angiogenesis [ ], gliogenesis [ ] and other neuronal/axonal changes [ ,  ] are induced by electroconvulsive seizures in animal models of ECT. These processes involving neuroplastic changes may contribute to ECT-induced structural changes. In addition to neuroplasticity, edema might be one of the reasons for ECT-induced volume increments. However, several MRI studies suggested that edema does not seem to be a primary cause because no evidence of ECT-related alterations in water content was found using T2 relaxometry [ ], FLAIR [ ] and DTI [ ]. This notion needs to be verified in ECT-treated patients with SZ. \n\n\n### ECT Modulates Functional Connectivity of Brain Networks \n  \nThe brain \u2018dysconnectivity hypothesis\u2019 posits that SZ is a psychiatric disorder characterized by disrupted interactions between functionally integrated networks, such as the DMN, SN, and frontotemporal network. Abnormal FCs within/between these brain networks are associated with psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments in individuals with SZ. The DMN plays a critical role in monitoring internal events during self-referential mental processes [ ]. Although increased and decreased FC of the DMN has been frequently reported in patients with SZ [ ,  ], a recent review summarized that hyperconnectivity characterizes compensatory recruitment of DMN hub regions in the SZ early stage, whereas hypoconnectivity is associated with deterioration of function in the later stage of the illness [ ]. Huang   et al.   found that the functional integration of the DMN could be restored in medication-resistant and later illness stage patients with SZ after ECT [ ]. They proposed that the \u201cnormalization\u201d of DMN hypoconnectivity might be a potential mechanism of ECT [ ]. Jiang   et al.   observed increased FC between the hippocampus and the DMN as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ ]. The hippocampus, which is also considered one of the DMN regions, is critical for memory encoding and retrieval functions [ ]. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a core node of the central executive network (CEN) that is responsible for interfacing with the external stimulus [ ]. These results suggest that ECT reinforces connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and CEN to modulate information integration between the internal- and external-based mental landscapes, thus may relieve the symptoms of SZ [ ]. In addition to the DMN and CEN, ECT also modulates the integration of interoceptive events and external stimuli by the regulation of FCs between the insula and orbitofrontal and primary cortex [ ]. Moreover, the relationship between ECT-induced changes in FCs and symptom reduction has been elucidated [ ]. Although some interpretations are speculative, these studies support that ECT modulates the functional interactions between large-scale brain networks, thereby alleviating symptoms [ - ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Transdiagnostic Effects of ECT on Brain \n  \nTo date, several studies have identified the transdiagnostic effects of ECT on brain structure and functional networks in patients with SZ and MDD [ ,  ,  ]. First, a network or system comprising the medial temporal lobe, predominantly in the hippocampus, parahippocampus and amygdala, showed a similar pattern of structural change (increased volume) in both SZ and MDD [ ,  ,  ,  ]. This finding is highly consistent with previous studies reporting ECT-induced volume increases in the transdiagnostic groups [ ,  ,  ,  ]. This finding suggested the transdiagnostic effects of ECT, at least in specific regions. In addition, ECT regulated internetwork connectivity in DMN in both SZ and MDD [ - ,  ]. As the anterior hub of the DMN, the MPFC has been consistently involved in the pathophysiology of both SZ and MDD [ ,  ]. Dysconnectivity of the MPFC may abnormally mediate self-referential cognitive and emotional processing, which are altered in both disorders [ ]. Huang   et al.   reported enhanced FC in the MPFC in SZ patients following ECT [ ]. Sambataro   et al.   also found that FC in the MPFC was enhanced in both SZ and MDD after ECT [ ]. However, it is unknown how ECT leads to clinical improvement in disorders via these altered FCs. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of the included studies should be noted. The first limitation is the small sample size. Because patients who receive ECT are mostly patients with acute symptoms, it is difficult to perform MRI scans at several time points. The largest study included only 29 patients who had two MRI scans (before and after ECT). The small sample size limits the reliability and sensitivity for detecting ECT-related changes and correlations with symptoms. Fortunately, this limitation may be addressed by the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC) [ ]. The second limitation involves antipsychotics. Most of the patients had already received antipsychotics before and during ECT. Although some studies included patients only treated with antipsychotic medications as the control group, it is difficult to eradicate the effects of concomitant antipsychotics during the ECT course. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that all of the alterations in these studies were fully attributed to the effects of ECT. The third limitation is the parameter of ECT. Most studies were performed with the bitemporal placement of electrodes. Three studies were performed with unilateral placement. In addition to electrode placement, the total number of ECT sessions was different for each patient. However, the effects of different parameters do not seem to be evaluated in the data analysis. Given the efficacy and tolerance of ECT, it is possible that ECT with different parameters may have different impacts on the brain structures and functions. At last, the limits are for MRI methods. Structural MRI data were analysed by conventional ROI-driven methods and data-driven methods, such as voxel-based morphometry. For fMRI data, FCs were evaluated by several methods, including ICA, voxelwise gFCD, and seed-based FC. In the predictive analysis, logistic regression, support vector machine and support vector regression were used for predictive models. Although multiple methods comprehensively explore brain information, the consistency of the results still needs further verification. In addition to the data analysis, multimodal MRI can reveal complementary characteristics about brain structures or functions. Only three studies measured structural and functional brain changes simultaneously based on multimodal MRI data. Due to the limited studies discussed above, we summarized MRI works examining structural and functional changes separately. In future works, multimodal MRI investigations are necessary to provide complementary information about brain structure, function, and coupling, which aids in improving the knowledge of the complex brain mechanism of ECT. \n\nThere are also several limitations of this review. First, it is difficult to conduct a systematic meta-analysis because several studies used different imaging modalities and analytical approaches. Second, specific studies, such as conference reports, abstracts and articles published in non-English, were not included in our review. In addition, unpublished or unreported negative results potentially influenced our conclusions. Two studies only included pre-ECT MRI scans. These studies were also included because they contributed to the predictive performance of ECT outcomes. Third, this review was not able to determine whether the placement of electrodes of ECT has a specific effect on brain changes due to the limited sample size of previous studies. Finally, several studies had identical or overlapping samples of patients. All these studies were mentioned in this review because they dealt with different scientific questions using different analysis methods or different modal MRIs. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nOur review summarized sMRI and fMRI changes in SZ patients following ECT. These sMRI studies consistently found ECT-induced volume increases in the hippocampus and adjacent areas as well as the insula. fMRI studies found ECT-induced changes in different brain regions/networks that are thought to be highly correlated with the pathophysiologic characteristics of SZ. The results of the correlation between brain changes and symptom remissions are inconsistent. In the future, improving the understanding of the mechanism related to medication-resistant in SZ would contribute to the neurobiological substrates of the ECT. \n\n\n## CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION \n  \nNot applicable. \n\n\n## STANDARDS OF REPORTING \n  \nPRISMA guidelines & methodology was followed. \n\n\n## FUNDING \n  \nThis work was partly supported by the grant from the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFA0701400), grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. grant number: U2033217, 61933003, 62003076, 62003058 and 81471638), the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) (No. 2019-I2M-5-039) and the project from China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (BX2021078).

M.\nPLoS One, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nA systematic review and activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the central innervation of the lower urinary tract: Pelvic floor motor control and micturition\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Purpose \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging is a powerful and versatile tool to investigate central lower urinary tract (LUT) control. Despite the increasing body of literature there is a lack of comprehensive overviews on LUT control. Thus, we aimed to execute a coordinate based meta-analysis of all PET and fMRI evidence on descending central LUT control, i.e. pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC) and micturition. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nA systematic literature search of all relevant libraries was performed in August 2020. Coordinates of activity were extracted from eligible studies to perform an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) using a threshold of uncorrected p <0.001. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n20 of 6858 identified studies, published between 1997 and 2020, were included. Twelve studies investigated PFMC (1xPET, 11xfMRI) and eight micturition (3xPET, 5xfMRI). The PFMC ALE analysis (n = 181, 133 foci) showed clusters in the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus, thalamus, supramarginal gyrus, and cerebellum. The micturition ALE analysis (n = 107, 98 foci) showed active clusters in the dorsal pons, including the pontine micturition center, the periaqueductal gray, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula and ventral pons. Overlap of PFMC and micturition was found in the cingulate gyrus and thalamus. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nFor the first time the involved core brain areas of LUT motor control were determined using ALE. Furthermore, the involved brain areas for PFMC and micturition are partially distinct. Further neuroimaging studies are required to extend this ALE analysis and determine the differences between a healthy and a dysfunctional LUT. This requires standardization of protocols and task-execution. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe neuronal control of the lower urinary tract is based on multilevel circuits, i.e. peripheral nerves, autonomic ganglia, spinal cord pathways, and supraspinal centers [ ]. The latter allow for the voluntary control and proper coordination of LUT function including synergic micturition (that is, bladder neck and external urethral sphincter relaxation during detrusor contraction) [ \u2013 ]. \n\nFunctional neuroimaging is a powerful and versatile tool to investigate the neural structures and processes involved in central lower urinary tract (LUT) control. The LUT motor control is usually only perceived as storage and micturition (detrusor control as autonomous activity), but the descending LUT control also includes voluntary, conscious pelvic floor muscle contractions (PFMC). Voluntary PFMC are a proxy for, but not the same as, the involuntary tonic contraction employed during the storage phase. Especially since PFMC tends to be a voluntary \u201cbackup\u201d mechanism which is employed during very strong urge to void or defecate. Despite the increasing body of literature, publications are scattered among various medical disciplines and there is a lack of comprehensive overview on the descending central LUT control [ \u2013 ]. Hence, it would be of great interest to get a structured overview on this topic and determine the most relevant brain areas involved in LUT motor control. This is of importance for a better understanding of the composition of supraspinal LUT control networks and to be able to distinguish between networks involved in healthy control as opposed to LUT dysfunction. This would contribute to elucidate the pathophysiology of some highly prevalent diseases within functional urology, like overactive and underactive bladder (OAB/UAB), bladder pain syndrome (BPS) and dysfunctional voiding. \n\nA well-established approach to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) of the existing neuroimaging data in order to achieve a comprehensive overview of the relevant brain regions involved in functional tasks of interest is Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis [ ]. ALE analyses determine the statistical probability of brain regions being consistently activated during a specific task. \n\nThe aim of the present systematic review is to summarize the existing evidence on the supraspinal motor control of the LUT in humans, i.e. micturition and PFMC, and to determine in an exploratory fashion the core brain areas involved in these functions using ALE. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study registration \n  \nThis systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016047488  ). \n\n\n### Literature search \n  \nA systematic search of all relevant publications was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. A search was conducted including all publications until August 2020,   contains the used search terms. Manual reference checks of accepted papers in recent reviews and included papers were performed as supplement to the electronic search. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nAll original publications on neuroimaging of lower urinary tract control in humans were eligible for full-text retrieval. \n\nThe use of a comprehensive search strategy resulted in a highly heterogeneous body of data which included a variety of neuroimaging techniques, populations, settings and protocols. In order to optimally utilize this extensive literature search, it was decided to split the extracted studies into smaller components addressing more concise research questions to get more precise answers. The current review focused on the assessment of LUT motor control using PET and fMRI. Therefore literature concerning PFMC or micturition using other neuroimaging techniques like diffusion MRI (tractography), DTI, NIRS, SPECT was excluded. \n\nHence, inclusion criteria were studies using fMRI or PET when performing micturition or pelvic floor muscle contractions that described the coordinates (in stereotactic space i.e. Talaraich (TAL) or MNI) of active clusters found during the performed task. Duplicates, abstracts only, conference proceedings, non-English text publications, non-human research and reviews were excluded. \n\n\n### Selection of studies \n  \nTitles and abstracts were screened in Endnote (EndNote X9; Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA, USA) by U.M. and B.B. and discrepancies were resolved by I.G. The selected articles were full text screened for eligibility by J.G. and I.G. using a standardized screening form, and discrepancies were discussed and resolved by a third reviewer (B.B.). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe data were independently extracted from the included full-text publications by two reviewers (J.G. and I.G.) using a standardized form. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by the third reviewer (B.B.). Data extracted were: general descriptive information of the studies, sample sizes, study population, characteristics describing the scanning protocol, applied analysis and the reported coordinates of supraspinal activity (raw data). \n\n\n### Raw data \n  \nThe extracted raw data were the coordinates of the activated clusters described by the included studies. The coordinates are shown in the orientation in which they were originally described, i.e. MNI or TAL. Most included studies focusing on micturition, separately reported the coordinates of the patients with successful micturition and unsuccessful micturition. The current study only extracted the coordinates of the subjects with successful micturition if the data was reported separately. In two studies the distinction between successful and unsuccessful micturition was not made. \n\n\n### Primary outcome: Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) \n  \nCoordinate-based meta-analyses of neuroimaging results were performed using GingerALE software (version 2.3.6) available on the BrainMap website ( ). ALE analysis uses all the reported foci from the included studies as a spatial probability distribution centered at the given coordinates. The analysis accommodates the spatial uncertainty of neuroimaging findings and uses a spatial variance model. Finally, the convergence of foci is tested against the null-hypothesis of random distribution of foci, creating the ALE score for each cluster. The TAL coordinates were converted to MNI space using the icbm2tal transform within the GingerALE software [ ]. A lenient threshold was used, taking the amount of data subjects into account (uncorrected p <0.001, minimal Volume of 100 mm ). Results were presented on an MNI template using Mango, multi-image viewing software ( ). \n\n\n### Risk of bias assessment \n  \nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool together with an assessment of the main confounders following recommendations of the Cochrane handbook for nonrandomized comparative studies [ , ] were used to perform a risk of bias analysis for included nonrandomized comparative studies. Firstly, a manual was developed for scoring the added confounders. Secondly, the main and added confounders were independently scored by two authors (J.G. and I.G.) and discrepancies were discussed.   shows the used confounders and how they were scored. \n   Scoring manual for the confounders in the risk of bias assessment.      \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe PRISMA flow diagram in   shows the results of the literature search and the study selection. The initially conducted search resulted in 6858 articles. After removing duplicates and title and abstract screening, 167 articles remained for full-text selection and in total 20 studies were included in this systematic review. \n   The PRISMA flow diagram.    \n### Study characteristics \n  \nTables   and   show the study characteristics of the included studies using fMRI and PET, respectively.

One of them [ ] did this using PET, the others all used fMRI. \n\nOf these 12 studies, 9 found active clusters in the primary motor cortex (M1), either in the right or left hemicortex, or both. Seven studies found activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Some studies reported activation in the frontal lobe, with coordinates widespread through the frontal lobe. The putamen showed active clusters in 4 studies, the thalamus and the insula both showed active clusters in 6 studies. Active clusters in the cerebellum were described in 9 studies.   shows the coordinates of all brain areas that have been consistently found in at least 3 of the included studies. If, in a single study, more than one cluster was identified in the same brain area, the cluster with the highest T- or Z-value is displayed in  . All active clusters described in individual studies only, are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### Micturition \n  \nEight studies investigated brain areas involved in micturition, of which 5 used fMRI and 3 used PET. The study of Kuhtz-Buschbeck et al. 2009 [ ], investigated initiation of voiding only, i.e. participants prevented voiding by contracting the pelvic floor when micturition was about to start, all other studies investigated real micturition. Only in the study of Khavari et al. data of patients with successful micturition (n = 7) and unsuccessful micturition (n = 9) were not reported separately. In four studies, patients could sign (hand or vocally) when they were about to start micturition [ \u2013 ]. Two studies used a flow/urine detector to detect the start of micturition [ , ] and in two studies patients were instructed when to start micturition [ , ]. Six studies found activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and 5 in the dorsal pons, including pontine micturition center (PMC). Cingulate gyrus was active in 6 studies. The insula, the thalamus, the mid frontal gyrus and the cerebellum were activated in 4 studies. The inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 11, 44\u201347) was found active in all studies.   shows peak coordinates of brain areas that were reported to be active in at least 3 of the included studies. If, in a single study, more than one cluster was found in the same brain area, the cluster with the highest T- or Z-value is displayed in  . All other active clusters described in individual studies only, are summarized in  . \n\n\n\n### Primary outcome: Activation likelihood estimation \n  \n#### Pelvic floor muscle contraction \n  \nThe ALE analysis of 133 peak coordinates derived from 12 different studies with a total number of 181 subjects of which 74 men and 95 women (all cluster/peak coordinates summarized in   and   Tables) yielded 10 active clusters using a statistical threshold of p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100 mm  ( ).   displays several of the ALE clusters: primary motor cortex, SMA, cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, substantia nigra/red nucleus and the cerebellum. \n   Results of the ALE analysis pelvic floor muscle contraction (p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100m ).  \n1 : Primary motor cortex, 1 : Mid cingulate gyrus, 1 : Supplementary motor area, 2: Thalamus left, 3: Supramarginal gyrus right, 5: Substantia Nigra, 6: Red nucleus, 7: Thalamus right, 8: Cerebellum left, 9: SUpramarginal gyrus left. \n     ALE results of PFMC and micturition tasks.        \n\n#### Micturition \n  \nThe ALE analyses of 98 peak coordinates derived from 8 different studies with a total number of 107 subjects of which 48 men and 59 women (all peak coordinates summarized in   and   Tables) yielded 7 active peak activations/clusters using a statistical threshold of p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100 mm  ( ).   displays exemplarily several of the ALE clusters: PMC, PAG, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus and insula.

Furthermore, ALE-analysis enabled us to extract from all raw data across studies the most commonly and reproducibly activated supraspinal areas involved in LUT motor control. \n\n### Pelvic floor muscle contraction \n  \n shows that most studies found active clusters in some obvious brain areas involved in pelvic floor motor control, e.g. M1 and SMA. Unexpectedly, three of the studies did not find activation in the M1 [ , , ] and 5 studies did not find activation in the SMA [ , , , ], but all studies found activation in either M1 or SMA. Schrum et al. did not find activation in M1. They used a cytoarchitectonic map [ ] to detect that more than 80% of the active cluster found in the medial wall belonged to the SMA. The authors argued that activation in the M1 would have been detected using a more liberal threshold [ ]. Several human and non-human primate studies have revealed a somatotopic organization of the SMA [ \u2013 ], and showed that the activated areas of the face, the upper limb, and the lower limb were located from anterior to posterior, respectively. This would indicate that activation in the SMA during PFMC might lie in the posterior part of the SMA, which is close to the somatotopic location of activation in the primary motor cortex during PFMC. Furthermore, Di Gangi Herms et al. showed that, after a training interval of 12 weeks regular PFMCs, the number of activated voxels on the SMA decreased significantly compared to before PFMCs training [ ]. This demonstrated that the SMA plays an important role in unconditioned motor tasks, like PFMC. Thus, PFMC being an unconditioned task might induce the appearance of large clusters on SMA, and together with its orientation in the posterior SMA, these clusters might be indistinguishable from activation in M1. This could be an explanation for the incongruent findings of the different studies on M1 or SMA. \n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to confirm the involved brain areas in pelvic floor motor control using an ALE-analysis ( ), namely the: M1, SMA, prefrontal cortex (BA 6 & 9), cingulate gyrus, thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Putamen activation however, was found in 4 of the included studies [ , , , ], but not in our ALE analysis. A possible explanation might be that the coordinates of the peak activations are spread across the putamen and that this did not result in the formation of a cluster in the ALE analysis. The role of the putamen in LUT control has been confirmed earlier, as this structure plays an important role in the corticostriatal pathway which participates in motor action selection and coordination [ ]. \n\nThe ALE analysis revealed two clusters (# 7 and #8) covering the substantia nigra and the red nucleus: parts of the basal ganglia involved in motor tasks [ ]. Two studies contributed to the formation of these clusters in the ALE analysis [ , ]. \n\n\n### Micturition \n  \nMicturition is a complex process, involving both voluntary and involuntary control regulated by a supraspinal network [ , ]. Until 1996, all available evidence for supraspinal micturition control was obtained from animal studies in cats [ ] or from case reports of humans with lesions in the prefrontal cortex [ ]. Blok et al. were the first to show brain activation in humans during micturition using PET [ , ]. However, the evidence in humans is still limited, possibly due to the fact that this LUT motor task is complicated to study. This is caused by several reasons; 1) In case of BOLD fMRI, repeated captures of the event-related data are necessary to obtain a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which is hard to establish considering the complex (autonomic and somatic) control of micturition, 2) Involved brain areas lie relatively closely to each other in the brainstem (PMC/PAG/thalamus); distinguishing these areas requires high resolution imaging, 3) A significant number of subjects are not able to void in the scanner, possibly due to the involvement of the prefrontal cortex involved in decision making in social context [ ]. The current study describes all PET and fMRI evidence for supraspinal micturition control and included 8 studies with a total of 107 subjects.   shows all raw data obtained in the last three decades. Using ALE analysis, this study evaluated all evidence and confirmed the involvement of these key brain areas during micturition: the PMC, the PAG, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, the insula and the cerebellum. Cluster 1 is a merged cluster covering the thalamus, PAG, PMC and the cerebellum. It has three obvious peak activations in the thalamus, PAG and PMC as shown in  . The dorsal pons includes the PMC and the ventral pons includes the pontine continence or storage center [ , ]. These current findings are in line with previous working models on the supraspinal networks supposed to be involved in micturition [ ]. \n\n and   Tables show that all studies found multiple active clusters diffuse across the prefrontal cortex. Peak activations were found in all Brodmann areas within the prefrontal cortex, most of which were located in Brodmann areas 9 and 44. Both areas (the medial prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal cortex) have been described previously to be involved in micturition [ , ]. The variability of the exact activity location within these areas may result from the variety of different protocols applied in the included studies. The prefrontal cortex has strong connections with other limbic structures\u2013the hypothalamus, amygdala, insula and cingulate gyrus and is known to be involved in the planning of complex cognitive behavior and appropriate social behavior [ ]. The voluntary decision when to void is generated in the prefrontal cortex in turn sending efferent signals via the cingulate to the PAG and PMC [ ]. The ALE analysis did not show an active cluster in the hypothalamus. However, two of the included studies did find such a cluster as shown in   [ , ]. As the hypothalamus is part of the limbic system, its role in micturition has been described before [ ]. The size of the area is rather small, making detection of active clusters challenging. \n\n\n### Micturition vs PFMC \n  \nThis systematic review studies the motor control of the LUT, consisting of one voluntary controlled task (PFMC) and one semi-voluntary controlled task (micturition). Although PFMC and micturition are both motor tasks of the LUT, they have completely different goals. Micturition is a complex coordinated process between the urinary bladder and the external urethral sphincter that aims to empty the bladder periodically, whereas PFMC is a more confined motor task. The latter attribute makes PMFC less complicated to study which may attract more attention and explain the larger number of PFMC studies compared to micturition studies despite it is only a part of the micturition cycle. PFMC concerns the voluntary (M1) contraction on top of the involuntary tonic contraction of the urethral sphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence. The minimal overlap of activated brain areas was therefore expected and demonstrates this distinct working mechanism of the supraspinal organization of both tasks. Comparison of the results shows that only two clusters overlap: midcingulate gyrus (MCG) and the left thalamus. The important role of the MCG in reward-based decision making has been described before [ ], and involvement of this area was expected in both LUT motor tasks. The involvement of the basal ganglia was also expected in both tasks. The thalamocortical pathway is important in execution of motor tasks [ ]. But, the thalamus is also involved in interoceptive networks, and is therefore important in initiation of micturition [ ]. \n\nPFMC can be studied during different bladder states (empty vs full), sometimes used to interrupt micturition or suppress the urge to void. In the PFMC ALE, 5 studies investigated PFMC with a full bladder [ , , , , ]. Among those, Zhang et al, compared activation between PFMC with empty vs full bladder and demonstrated differences in SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum. This might be of great interest towards the clinical applicability of fMRI in patient populations. To better understand the influence of bladder status on pelvic floor control, further studies comparing results at different bladder states are necessary. \n\nAlthough the current meta-analysis did not specifically focus on sex related differences, data of both men and women were included. Tables   and   demonstrate that only three studies (2 PFMC and 1 micturition) in this review studied both men and women [ , , ]. The amount of data in the current systematic review was not sufficient to repeat the ALE analysis separately for men and women to study differences. The studies that included both men and women did compare the results between men and women. Moreover, the study of Seseke et al. focused specifically on this topic in relation to micturition comparing their male results with previous female results [ ]. In PFMC, no sex related differences were found [ ], however, in another study about external anal sphincter contraction, greater activity was found in men [ ]. Various arguments for this difference are described, like a more forceful contraction in men, the obvious anatomical differences between the genitourinary system or a general interhemispheric asymmetry of the human motor cortex related to sexes [ , , ]. In micturition, stronger task related activity in the right thalamus and other right-hemispherical regions was found in women compared to men [ ]. Still, results on this topic are scarce and very heterogeneous. Other studies speculate that women have a stronger brain activity during visceral stimulation than men [ , ]. \n\n\n### Clinical implications & reliability \n  \nCompared to the pre-neuroimaging-era, when knowledge of LUT control was mainly based on animal studies which provided a relevant basis to understand particularly spinal and brain stem structures and circuits involved in LUT control [ \u2013 ], cortical and subcortical processes in human LUT control were largely unknown. Advances in neuroimaging allowed us to progressively explore this field and to learn which brain areas are involved in human LUT control and how they may be connected. This is of specific value considering that certain LUT diseases such as OAB occur in humans only. In addition, chronic LUT dysfunction may lead to alterations in suprapinal processing of LUT afferent and efferent signaling that itself contribute to or maintain the LUT dysfunction. Therefore, such alterations should be known and understood to improve treatment strategies and to advance the evaluation of treatments targeting suprapinal signal processing such as neuromodulative therapies. This current review and meta-analysis for the first time describes the key brain areas of all previous investigations on LUT motor control, i.e. PFMC and micturition. Knowing the key brain areas and their involvement in different tasks, i.e. PFMC vs micturition, it is important to address new and more specific research questions, to plan according neuroimaging studies, and to address targets for neurofeedback therapy [ ]. Specifically interesting in this regard is that our findings clearly demonstrate that the voluntary motor control of PFMC involves typical cortical motor control areas such as M1 and SMA whereas the autonomic detrusor motor control involves brain stem activity, i.e. PAG and PMC, instead. One of the brain areas that is involved in both motor tasks is the cerebellum which seems to play a more relevant role in LUT motor control than previously expected. \n\nSince our knowledge about the physiology of the innervation of the LUT has grown, lately more research is focusing on the results of neuroimaging in patients with LUT disorders, like chronic pelvic pain syndrome [ ], stress urinary incontinence (SUI) [ ], urge urinary incontinence [ , ] or multiple sclerosis (MS) [ , ]. Khavari et al [ ], studied differences in activation after onabotulinumA injections in patients with UUI and MS compared to healthy controls. It was demonstrated that during full urge, patients with UUI and MS show more deactivations compared to healthy controls in cortical and subcortical structures. After onabotulinumA injections, the brain responses were more in agreement with those of healthy controls. Furthermore, a study of Griffiths et al [ ]. clearly demonstrated an increased activation in patients with full bladder and UUI compared to healthy controls, particularly in the cingulate gyrus, SMA and prefrontal cortex. What these studies suggest, is that when patients react to therapy, activation patterns had more similarities with those of healthy controls, which is a very usable finding in future implication of fMRI [ , , , \u2013 ]. In the current ALE analysis, two studies were included with a patient population instead of healthy controls. One micturition related study included patients with MS [ ] and one PFMC related study included patients with SUI [ ]. Both ALE analyses (PFMC and micturition) were repeated without inclusion of the patient data to assess the influence on the outcome. Only the amount of clusters changed (the ones with the lowest ALE values disappeared), however, most probably due to the lower number of included subjects in the ALE analysis which is critical for the validity of such analysis and hampers a reasonable interpretation of these differences from a statistical point of view. As visible in the raw data in the supplements, both studies including patient data do not show remarkable outliers, or other distinguishing results compared to the studies including healthy volunteers. \n\nStudying differences in supraspinal activation patterns between healthy controls and patients is important for future clinical implications of neuroimaging and the search towards finding the pathophysiology of diseases within functional urology. The SMA, cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex have been independently described as areas of interest when evaluating differences between patients and healthy controls, full or empty bladder and effect of therapies [ , , , \u2013 ]. \n\nDespite that ALE values cannot be directly compared between different datasets due to the given heterogeneity of the original studies included in the datasets, they still provide a good estimate which brain areas may be more relevant for specific LUT tasks or more consistently activated in states of LUT dysfunction. To allow a meaningful ALE meta-analysis on the differences between healthy controls and patients we would need more original studies that statistically compare both groups, i.e. patients and healthy controls, and provide data (e.g. coordinates) on the group differences that can be included into the meta-analysis. Alternatively, using a rather new approach which aims to compare separate ALE maps of different data sets from healthy controls and patients [ ], we would need a larger number of studies investigating healthy controls and patients with a similar total amount of subjects and using same or similar task and imaging protocols. Currently, there are only few functional neuroimaging studies on patients with LUT dysfunction and those studies comparing results to healthy controls do this descriptively only. \n\nThe ability of the ALE meta-analysis to elicit relevant brain areas involved in the execution of specific tasks as demonstrated for micturition and PFMT is particularly valuable in the current stage of neuroimaging research in functional urology where mainly whole brain analyses are performed which provide a good overview but may also generate a lot of noise and less relevant secondary activity, specifically when applying lower statistical thresholds (e.g. uncorrected thresholds or voxel-level FDR) to detect any LUT related activity. Here, ALE meta-analysis can help to keep the focus by determining the more consistently involved areas and subsequently also to better specify study hypotheses and designs of future neuroimaging experiments. \n\nCertainly, functional neuroimaging studies on bladder-brain control are a big challenge in many aspects and current study designs and imaging parameters may still be not optimal which may be at least partly reflected by a rather poor reliability [ , ]. Nevertheless, to advance evidence in this field and since validity of ALE analysis depends on the data amount and quality [ , ] more effort is needed to provide such data. \n\nTwo aspects appear relevant for this endeavor: a) validation of task and imaging parameters to better understand and control for measurement related bias and to be able to apply higher statistical thresholds. b) correlation of neuroimaging findings to clinical outcomes to better understand the relation between supraspinal activity patterns and dysfunction or symptoms. To better compare between or pool studies, harmonization of protocols (including measures for prevention of movement artefacts, specifically eye movements) and terminology would be of great advantage [ ]. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe current systematic review and ALE analysis makes all raw data available and creates a clear overview of fMRI and PET imaging of the supraspinal control of the LUT. Our liberal search strategy additionally allowed a very comprehensive review. Nevertheless, there are limitations. This systematic review only included studies using the neuroimaging techniques fMRI or PET, since these techniques yield reliable coordinated-based results, usable for the ALE analysis. Data of other neuroimaging techniques apart from fMRI and PET was therefore not included. Furthermore, to perform a valid ALE analysis and reach sufficient power, the amount of included data is important, which is a criticizable point in the current ALE analysis [ ]. However, within the urological field the amount of neuroimaging data is still limited making the use of a liberal threshold inevitable when performing a coordinate based meta-analysis. Altogether, the results of the current systematic review have to be interpreted with the limited amount of data and the risk of bias in mind. Future perspectives are that the preliminary results of the current study encourage to generate more data on this topic, thus allowing for ALE meta-analyses with more significant value. This might enable us to better specify the typical activation patterns (ALE results) in response to certain LUT tasks and to understand if and how pattern may differ between healthy controls and patients with LUT dysfunction. \n\nAnother limitation is that this review does not focus on deactivations. As most included studies only report activations, it was decided to focus on activation and not on deactivation. Comparing the overlap of the PFMC and micturition task can therefore be partly biased (see  ). For example, a cluster that activated during PFMC but deactivated during micturition should be counted as an overlapping cluster, but is not found in the current analysis. Despite both tasks are motor tasks of the LUT, they may be used in opposite direction since the pelvic floor should not be contracted during micturition. \n\nThe risk of bias analysis was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias guidelines [ ]. As this tool is not specifically designed for neuroimaging studies, the risk of bias might be underestimated [ ]. It revealed an unclear risk of bias, which is at least partly related to the great variability of study designs, scan protocols, analysis pathways, and the lack of standardization of reporting methods and outcome measures. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis systematic review and ALE analysis define all fMRI and PET evidence for the motoric innervation of the LUT. The key brain areas involved in PFMC are M1, SMA, cingulate gyrus, putamen, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, insula and the cerebellum. The key brain areas involved in micturition are the PAG, PMC, cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Considering the presented activations, both, PFMC and micturition appear distinct which is in line with their different contextual execution. However, deactivations which are underreported and less well understood could not be systematically considered and may show more overlap than currently presented. Despite that the evidence for neuroimaging of the LUT is still scarce and the affective involvement in performing these tasks makes it challenging to study LUT motor tasks, the involved brain areas in healthy controls seem to be defined, so the step towards defining pathology in a patient population with functional bladder disorders can be made. However, this requires standardization of protocols and task execution. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7857581, "text_md5": "cf025a4edced127c6359c99d76fe7282", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 124], "journal": [125, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 318], "keywords": [332, 332], "abstract": [345, 2127], "body": [2136, 36430]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 33534812, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0246042", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857581", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7857581"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857581\">7857581</a>", "list_title": "PMC7857581  A systematic review and activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the central innervation of the lower urinary tract: Pelvic floor motor control and micturition"}

However, less is known about brain regions associated with non-conscious processing of faces, and whether a right-hemispheric dominance persists in line with specific affective responses. We aim to review the neural responses systematically, quantitatively, and qualitatively underlying subliminal face processing. PubMed was searched for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) publications assessing subliminal emotional face stimuli up to March 2022. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses and narrative reviews were conducted on all studies that met ALE requirements. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. In a meta-analysis of all 22 eligible studies (merging clinical and non-clinical populations, whole brain and region of interest analyses), bilateral amygdala activation was reported in the left (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1) in 59% of studies, and in the right (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4) in 68% of studies. In a second meta-analysis of non-clinical participants only (  n   = 18), bilateral amygdala was again reported in the left (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4) and right (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4) in 56% of studies for both clusters. In a final meta-analysis of whole-brain studies only (n=14), bilateral amygdala was also reported in the left (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2) in 64% of studies, and right (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8) in 71% of studies. The findings suggest that non-consciously detected emotional faces may influence amygdala activation, especially right-lateralized (a higher percentage of convergence in studies), which are integral for pre-conscious affect and long-term memory processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDetection of faces and the rapid initiation of appropriate emotional reactions constitutes part of the foundation for smooth social interactions and ultimately our survival. Visual search paradigms, such as \u201cface-in-the-crowd,\u201d highlight how the presence of a face, the direction of attention and whether it poses a potential threat, can be detected within the blink of an eye (Pinkham et al.,  ). This automatic processing is largely attributed to the emotional salience portrayed by a face, whereby expressions of anger, fear and disgust significantly raise our vigilance and give an evolutionary advantage for avoiding harm (Murphy and Zajonc,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). By contrast, difficulties with face perception may severely impact social cognitions, e.g., emotion recognition and interpretation of social cues, as seen in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Kleinhans et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ). \n\nEmotion processing is suggested to be dichotomized, with one subcortical and subconscious pathway for emotionally salient stimuli, while the other pathway extends into cortex with integration in the amygdala for more detailed perceptual information (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). In support of the presence of these two separate pathways, delineating the neural pathways of subconscious face processing is often done with subliminal approaches using temporal backward masking and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) (Phillips et al.,  ; Kouider et al.,  ). By manipulating the time interval\u2014the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA)\u2014between the target and the mask, the target stimulus can be interrupted as higher order mechanisms compete with the non-target in object recognition (Enns and Di Lollo,  ). Despite not being consciously perceived, subliminal stimuli can elicit behavioral and physiological responses, e.g., emotional memories, increased skin conductance, and accompanying neural activity (Sebastiani et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ). For example, subliminal emotional faces, masked by neutral faces, activate similar brain areas as those presented supraliminally (Prochnow et al.,  ). These regions may include the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontal cortex (Prochnow et al.,  ; Freeman et al.,  ). \n\nLesion and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a hemispheric lateralization for face processing may exist, with the right hemisphere processing faces holistically and non-consciously, while the left appears to be involved in feature-based processing (Morris et al.,  ; Wada and Yamamoto,  ; Fr\u00e4ssle et al.,  ). Holistic processing is particularly important for face recognition, where key facial features are integrated as a whole rather than being perceived separately (Wang et al.,  ). Emotion processing is also suggested to be lateralized, according to two prevailing hypotheses (L\u00e0davas and Bertini,  ; Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). The right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis postulates that emotions are processed in the right hemisphere independent of their valence. The valence lateralization hypothesis claims that the left is responsible for processing positively valenced stimuli, while the right hemisphere processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, it has been debated whether right-hemispheric dominance occurs, and if this occurs independently of conscious awareness and the emotional valence of faces (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Gainotti,  ; Meng et al.,  ). \n\nTo answer these questions, and to address the variability of fMRI methodologies\u2014such as differences in participant samples, stimulus presentations, applied contrasts, coordinate systems (e.g., Talairach, MNI, and AFNI), scanner strength and statistical analyses\u2014Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses are effective. By analyzing coordinates from individual fMRI studies investigating similar questions, the convergence of foci can be detected with limited confounding effects of varying methodologies, e.g., by weighting foci according to sample size for each study and by using both the statistical significance of individual voxels and a minimum threshold for cluster size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). By doing this, probability maps of neuronal activation can be calculated that lowers the bias introduced by different studies (Kirby and Robinson,  ). In addition, diagnostic   post-hoc   tests and sub-analyses further improve the risk of bias (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nSeparate ALE approaches have previously been applied to study emotional facial processing and differences between subliminal and supraliminal stimuli (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). In Brooks et al. ( ), significant ALE clusters for subliminally presented emotional faces were found in the right amygdala and the right cerebellum. A right hemisphere specialization for unconscious fear-related stimuli was also discussed in a narrative review by L\u00e0davas and Bertini ( ). However, there have been no ALE meta-analyses since 2012 focusing solely on subliminal emotional face processing and so now additional relevant fMRI studies have been published. As such, we aim to expand on Brooks et al.'s ( ) work by implementing the ALE method to quantitatively (in both whole brain and region of interest analyses) review neural responses underlying subliminal emotional face processing. To further nuance the quantitative ALE review, the goal of the qualitative review is to report emotion-specific neural responses to subliminal faces expressing the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger (Ekman,  ). These six emotions are deemed universal and are suggested to be linked with distinct expressions and physiological changes (Ekman,  ). Identifying patterns of lateralization may shed light on underlying neural responses to emotional processing of faces, and hint at how facial processing might be altered in developmental and psychiatric disorders that have core deficits in emotion processing (such as autism, schizophrenia, eating disorders). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe followed the 10   Simple Rules for Neuroimaging Meta-analysis   (M\u00fcller et al.,  ): (1) Specificity of research question (what are the neural correlates of non-consciously processed emotional faces?). (2) Power of meta-analysis (meta-analyses presented here included   n   = 22,   n   = 18 and an exploratory analysis of more robust whole brain studies   n   = 14, with the suggested limit being   n   = 17\u201320). (3) Collect and organize data (the data extracted from studies are presented systematically in  ). (4) Experiments use the same search coverage (separate ALEs were conducted for all studies and whole brain only). (5) Adjust for multiple contrasts within experiments (no included studies contained multiple studies). (6) Double check data and report (Our data collection, inclusion/exclusion criteria, reported foci and analyses were conducted by AD, AS, and SB and compared). (7) Plan and register analyses (AD, AS, and SB discussed the contrasts to be done and separate analyses. Unfortunately, the protocol was not registered beforehand\u2014it was deemed an update of a previously published study: Brooks et al.,  ). (8) Balance sensitivity and susceptibility for false positives (a more conservative FWE correction was applied to all ALEs). (9) Show diagnostics (the number of studies contributing to the clusters, and the size/ALE value of the cluster were reported. A risk of bias assessment using the AXIS tool was reported). (10) Transparent reporting (detailed search terms, included studies and GingerALE parameters fully described). \n  \nfMRI studies included in ALE meta-analyses and narrative review (  n   = 22). \n    \n### Literature Search \n  \nThis review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al.,  ;  ). The review was not registered. The PRISMA checklist of recommended items to be reported can be found in  . A computerized search using the database PubMed was conducted, covering the periods from 1975 to March 2022 (last search 2022-03-24). Searches were conducted on titles and abstracts containing the following terms (  = truncated): (fMRI OR brain imaging OR functional magnetic resonance imaging) AND (sublim  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (sublim  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND facial  AND emotion ). Additional filters were utilized to refine the search further; these included: Adults (18+), human participants, English language, no reviews, no case studies, and no meta-analyses. \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of the relevant steps for the literature search conducted in PubMed (Page et al.,  ). Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and narrative review. During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. From the   n   = 74 reports assessed for eligibility,   n   = 52 studies were excluded according to exclusion criteria, leaving   n   = 22 studies. \n  \n\n### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria \n  \nTo prevent selection bias, the PRISMA recommendations for systematic literature analysis have been followed and two authors (AD and AS) selected studies based on the broad search terms. Studies were included if they: (a) used task-based fMRI, (b) were conducted using subliminal/non-conscious presentation of faces using backward masking, (c) included human faces of any gender, race, age, and demonstrating any emotion vs. a neutral face or neutral image, (d) reported the neural activation or deactivation co-ordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space, (e) assessed brain regional activation and deactivation using contrast analyses and not regression models, (f) were published in English, and (g) were published in a peer-reviewed journal article. Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review ( ). During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. \n\n\n### Selected Studies \n  \nOf the 74 publications assessed for eligibility, 52 did not meet the inclusion criteria ( ,  ). Studies were excluded if they did not provide within-subjects contrasts comparing subliminal emotional face stimuli with subliminal neutral stimuli, if the participants were conditioned to the stimuli, if the participants were children, if the participants were made aware of the subliminal presentations before testing and if MNI or Talairach coordinates were not reported. Thus, 22 publications remained and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review. Risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the AXIS appraisal tool ( ). Of these 22 studies, eight were region of interest (ROI) studies, four were whole brain studies, and 10 reported both ROI and whole brain results. The total number of participants was   n   = 796 (50:50 women:men). In the first meta-analysis, all 22 studies (both ROI and whole brain) were included regardless of participant population; the second meta-analysis used only 18 studies (again both ROI and whole brain) that did not include clinical populations; the third meta-analysis excluded the 8 ROI studies (to prevent biasing of ALE results), and examined the 14 whole brain studies as an exploratory analysis. Across the reviewed studies, the subliminal emotional face stimuli expressed fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust. Control conditions included neutral faces, fixation cross, blank screen, no-face stimulus (a gray rectangle), visual noise masks of scrambled faces and non-emotional images (e.g., tomato). See   for details of included studies in both the quantitative and qualitative analysis. The analyzed contrasts from each study are reported in  . \n\n\n### fMRI Methods \n  \nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that indirectly measures neuronal activation   via   Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD). fMRI studies utilize either a whole brain or a ROI technique to measure BOLD. Using whole brain, significant activation clusters are localized by examining voxels across the global space. Conversely, ROI analyses use a mask to include or remove a brain area/areas from statistical analysis. ROI analyses are less favorable to include in ALE analyses as they tend to inflate the significance of the meta-analysis. ROI analyses differ from small volume correction (SVC) in terms of to what this test is applied and the subsequent output. For example, ROIs return a single   t  /  F  -value for the whole ROI, given that the test is applied to an average signal of all voxels. Conversely, in the SVC procedure, the test is applied to all voxels (voxel-wise) and therefore the output is a volumetric statistical map with   t  /  F  -values for each voxel within the small volume. ROI analyses were reported by eight studies included in the current meta-analyses, and so additional analyses were conducted to examine whether these ROI studies biased the overall findings. \n\n\n### Quantitative Data Analyses\u2014ALE \n  \nBrainMap GingerALE version 3.0.2 software (Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) was used to complete the ALE analyses described above, with the updated version of the ALE approach (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Foci were extracted from publications examining neural responses to subliminal face perception, checked by two researchers (AS, SJB). Papers that reported coordinates in standard Talairach space were converted into MNI using the GingerALE software. Text files were subsequently created, listing the study names, number of subjects and a list of the foci (MNI coordinates) associated with neural activation to subliminal stimuli. Specifically, three separate ALE analyses were conducted: (a) utilizing all 22 publications incorporating both whole brain and ROI, and including all types of participant (e.g., clinical and healthy controls); (b) 18 publications that only examined subliminal face processing in healthy controls; (c) an exploratory examination including 14 publications of only healthy controls in whole brain studies (excluding ROI studies). Text files of foci were cross-checked by two researchers as above and are provided as   (Data Sheet). \n\nALE is a statistical modeling technique examining variance between and within fMRI studies using the total foci coordinates reported in each study to build a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel, enabling a modeled activation (MA) threshold map for each study (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Differences in foci positions can be a consequence of between-study variance, e.g., in templates used or heterogeneity of participants, and as such these two main issues are considered in the parameters of the kernel. This is done by weighting the foci reported by the number of participants in each study. Finally, MA maps for each study are combined for each separate meta-analysis, creating an experimental ALE map. This is tested against the null hypothesis that there is random variation in relation to the spatial orientation of neural activation for the specific meta-analysis (e.g., subliminal presentation of faces), but that the within-study variation is fixed. A random effects model is employed by the ALE analysis technique, which assumes a higher than chance likelihood of consensus between different experiments, but not in relation to activation variance within each study. The null distribution map is permuted by the number of studies that constitute each meta-analysis. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used a threshold of   p   < 0.05 False Discovery Rate (FDR), and chose a minimum cluster size of 100 mm , in accordance with our recent ALE publications on this subject (Brooks et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ), and we also used a more conservative (as opposed to dilated) kernel threshold under ALE preferences (Eickhoff et al.,  ). We used an anatomical image overlay program called Mango ( ) to illustrate the results of our meta-analyses. GingerALE employs the term \u201ccontributing studies,\u201d to describe studies that are located within the boundaries of ALE cluster. However, this does not discount other studies that might be located near these boundaries but outside of the cluster, which could have also contributed to it. \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Quantitative/ALE-Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe significant clusters including those that were significant at the cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a more conservative (smaller) mask threshold, are reported in   for each meta-analysis, and in  . \n  \nClusters of statistically significant activation. \n    \nSignificant ALE cluster maxima of neural activation to subliminal emotional face stimuli surviving FDR correction,   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons, cluster size >100 mm . Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are given. Meta-analysis 1 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221219.1, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1), right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 2 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 3 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n  \n### Meta-Analysis One: Significant ALE Clusters From All Studies \n  \nFrom 193 foci, 835 subjects, and 22 separate studies (24 experiments), the ALE analysis revealed two significant clusters that survived FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Two: Significant ALE Clusters From Non-clinical Samples \n  \nFrom 168 foci, 647 subjects and 18 separate studies (18 experiments), two clusters survived the FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Three: Significant ALE Clusters From Whole Brain Studies Only \n  \nWe also ran a separate exploratory analysis of the whole brain studies alone, excluding any studies which only conducted ROI analyses. From 144 foci, 541 subjects, and 14 studies, the ALE analysis revealed two clusters which survived FWE correction and the predefined cluster criterion. Cluster one was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2). Cluster two was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8). \n\nOf note, the highest percentage of contributing studies was 71% for activation in the right amygdala in whole brain studies only (  n   = 10), and while this was a small number of studies, this finding was corroborated by 68% of all studies reporting right amygdala activation to subliminal emotional faces (  n   = 15). \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Qualitative/Narrative Review \n  \nA summary of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli for each of the 22 included studies is presented in  . \n  \nSummary diagrams of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli in the reviewed fMRI studies. Subliminally presented faces expressed   (A)   mixed emotional expressions,   (B)   sadness,   (C)   anger,   (D)   fear,   (E)   surprise,   (F)   happiness, and   (G)   disgust. The number within each bar indicates the   n   of the studies. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; NAcc, nucleus accumbens. \n  \n### Emotional Faces: Anger, Happiness, and Sadness Combined \n  \nProchnow et al. ( ) presented facial expressions of anger, happiness, and sadness supraliminally (400 ms) or subliminally (40 ms). Both supraliminal and subliminal conditions of emotional faces elicited activation in the occipital cortex (OCC), fusiform gyrus, and caudal intra-parietal sulcus (cIPS), in comparison to baseline conditions with neutral face masks. Supraliminal emotional faces also activated the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), the right posterior cingulate cortex, the right superior colliculi, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) bordering the anterior insula, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the subliminal emotional faces there was an increase in activation along the posterior right STS, the left premotor cortex area 6, and in the right DLPFC ( ). Control objects (supraliminal non-emotional images, e.g., chair, followed by unemotional adjective pairs) were associated with bilateral activation in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, dorsal paracingulate cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), DLFC, and left premotor area 6. \n\n\n### Fearful Faces \n  \nTen studies with healthy adult samples investigated the subliminal processing of fearful faces in comparison to neutral faces. Liddell et al. ( ) found that masked (16.7 ms) presentations of fearful facial expressions evoked significantly increased activity in the left superior colliculus, left pulvinar, bilateral amygdalae, and bilateral anterior cingulate. The right amygdala showed a larger cluster of activation than the left. Whole brain analysis confirmed the significant activity observed in the left ventral anterior cingulate seen in the ROI analysis. Whole brain analysis also demonstrated significant responses to subliminal fear in fronto-temporal and somatosensory-related cortices. \n\nIn Pichon et al. ( ), subliminal face presentation was conducted using both forward masking and backward masking (66 ms after the prime) with visual noise masks (scrambled face stimuli). The subliminal faces elicited activations in the bilateral occipital face area (OFA), right fusiform face area (FFA), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG BA45 and BA47), but no activation in the amygdala. Fearful face primes resulted in left parahippocampal gyrus activation, which was enhanced when the target faces appeared at the expected rather than the unexpected time. However, significant changes in activation in the amygdala and FFA were not found. Unlike the influence of temporal attention, the gender congruence of the prime and target face did not influence the parahippocampal gyrus activation. \n\nWhen comparing subliminal and supraliminal presentations of fearful facial expressions, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant activity in the left amygdala, the left dorsal ACC and in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) extending to the right hemisphere in supraliminal fear conditions relative to neutral conditions. Subliminal fear conditions, relative to neutral, elicited significant activity in the bilateral amygdala and ventral right MPFC, extending into the ventral ACC. Whole brain analysis between-conditions confirmed that supraliminal fear had significantly greater responses relative to subliminal fear in DLPFC and visual regions. In contrast, subliminal fear elicited comparatively greater responses in the right hypothalamus and the right ventral ACC. \n\nYang et al. ( ) used encoding and retrieval phases to investigate the affective priming effect for fearful faces. Backward masked fearful or neutral faces were presented during the encoding and during the retrieval participants judged the fearful or neutral expression of the target face. Participants who were unaware the subliminal priming had stronger activation in the left amygdala, while participants who were aware of the priming had stronger activity in the left prefrontal cortex, left occipital region and the left fusiform gyrus. Moreover, unaware participants primed with fearful faces (vs. neutral) produced greater activity in the right amygdala and the right pulvinar. In aware participants, fearful faces generated stronger activity in the left amygdala, right fusiform gyrus and the left STS. They also found a congruency effect whereby congruent faces (fearful\u2013fearful) elicited weaker amygdala activation than incongruent faces (neutral\u2013fearful). \n\nThe supraliminal (179 ms) and subliminal fearful faces (30 ms) were presented to male participants in Phillips et al. ( ). Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the left precuneus, the bilateral superior and the right middle temporal gyri for subliminal fear, and bilateral superior and the right middle temporal and lingual gyri and precuneus for supraliminal fear. Both supraliminal and subliminal fear activated the left inferior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral inferior parietal lobules, and the right cerebellum. Voxels of significant activation in the right amygdala were detected in the supraliminal fear condition, but not in the subliminal condition. Subliminal fear elicited activation in the left caudate nucleus. Moreover, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral cerebellum showed significantly greater mean power of response to subliminal fear than supraliminal presentations of fear. \n\nMasked fear (33 ms) in Etkin et al. ( ) elicited significant activation in the right basolateral amygdala, which was also found to be correlated with anxious traits in the healthy adult sample. Non-masked fear (200 ms) did not lead to basolateral amygdala activation, but instead right dorsal amygdala activation, which was not correlated to anxiousness. Chen et al. ( ) observed right amygdala activation in response to masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces, while non-masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces activated the left amygdala. \n\nEleven out of 12 male participants in Mathiak et al. ( ) showed amygdala responses to fearful faces, whereby seven subjects had bilateral activation, three had left-lateralized activation and one right-lateralized activation. However, volume-corrected thresholds for masked fearful stimuli did not generate significant amygdala activity. Nor did masked fearful faces in Cui et al. ( ) generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex) or in the ROIs of Suslow et al. ( ) (amygdala, thalamus, caudate nuclei, and putamen). \n\n\n### Happy Faces \n  \nOf the reviewed fMRI studies with healthy adult participants, eight included masked happy faces in their subliminal paradigms. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found significant activations in the bilateral amygdala for subliminally presented happy faces (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms). Likewise, adult women in Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) showed significant activation within the left and right amygdala following happy faces masked by neutral faces. In addition, they detected clusters of elevated activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri. The observed right amygdala activation and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri activation during the masked happiness condition were found to be significantly greater than in the masked sadness condition. Suslow et al. ( ) reported clusters of significant activation in response to masked happy faces in the right inferior parietal lobule to right middle temporal regions and in the right thalamus. These clusters were also positively correlated to implicit extraversion measures. \n\nHappy faces presented subliminally in Duan et al. ( ), elicited increased neural activity in the left amygdala, anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal/orbito-frontal gyrus, and right inferior temporal gyrus, in comparison to neutral faces. When contrasting masked happy faces with masked surprised faces, the happy faces were associated with increased activation of the left posterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Masked presentation of happy faces may also activate the bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc), as demonstrated in Suslow et al. ( ). The right NAcc activation was also found to have a significant positive correlation with the affective priming score of the neutral target face, however no significant priming based on happy faces was established. \n\nIn Victor et al. ( ), females showed reduced BOLD responses to masked happy vs. masked neutral faces in the left amygdala, the right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and the right pregenual ACC (pgACC), relative to men. When amygdala activity was recorded in response to masked faces with happy, sad and angry expressions using fMRI in Dannlowski et al. ( ), no significant effect of gender was observed for any of the investigated emotions. Regarding happy faces vs. neutral faces, no significant bilateral amygdala activity was found during subliminal presentation. However, in comparison to the no-face baseline, subliminal happy faces elicited activations in the right amygdala. Masked happy faces in Cui et al. ( ) did not generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex). \n\n\n### Sad Faces \n  \nFive of the studies examined the brain activation patterns elicited by subliminal faces with sad expressions in healthy adults. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found that sad faces presented subliminally (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms) significantly activated the bilateral amygdala. Suslow et al. ( ) also found significant bilateral amygdala activation following the masked presentation of sad faces. This amygdala activation had significant positive correlations with the affective priming scores given to the neutral target faces. In addition, whole brain analysis revealed a positive correlation between medial frontal gyrus activation and the affective priming score based on sad faces, which was significantly higher than the positive correlation between amygdala activation and affective priming scores. \n\nThe subliminal presentation of sad faces in Dannlowski et al. ( ) yielded significant bilateral amygdala activity, in comparison to both neural faces and the no-face baseline. In addition, greater amygdala responses to masked sad sadness were associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. However, in the female sample of Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ), masked sad faces only generated significantly greater activation within the right amygdala, whereas the left amygdala did not show significant activation. When compared to the masked happiness condition, the masked sadness did not have any suprathreshold voxels within the ROIs. Female participants in Victor et al. ( ), showed elevated BOLD responses to viewing masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus and the bilateral sgACC, compared to male participants. \n\n\n### Angry Faces \n  \nThe processing of subliminal angry facial expressions was investigated in four of the reviewed studies ( ). Significantly increased bilateral amygdala activity was seen for masked angry faces, in comparison to neutral faces, in Dannlowski et al. ( ). However, the elevated amygdala activity following presentation of angry faces was not significantly higher than the no face baseline condition. Similar to the sad faces, the stronger amygdala activation in response to masked angry faces was associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. Cui et al. ( ) found a cluster of activation in the rostral ACC in response to masked angry faces. Rostral ACC activation was also correlated with higher scores on measures of anger and anxiety. In Nomura et al. ( ), the anger prime, neutral prime and control conditions all produced activation in the right fusiform gyrus. Right amygdala activation was only detected in the anger prime condition. Moreover, the responses in the right amygdala had a significant negative correlation with activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus within the angry face prime condition. A significant positive correlation was found between the rate of judgment of anger of the target face and activation intensity in the right amygdala. In Chen et al. ( ) neither subliminal nor supraliminal angry faces elicited amygdala activation in comparison to neutral faces. \n\n\n### Surprised Faces \n  \nOne of the reviewed fMRI studies focused on the neural responses to surprised faces presented below conscious awareness. In comparison to masked neutral faces, masked surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right amygdala, and right thalamus (Duan et al.,  ). Above threshold activation was also detected in clusters within the occipital lobe and temporal lobe. When comparing masked surprised faces with masked happy faces, surprise showed increased activation in the bilateral amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. Clusters of suprathreshold activation were also present in the cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal, and occipital lobes. \n\n\n### Disgusted Faces \n  \nDisgusted faces were investigated by Phillips et al. ( ) using subliminal (30 ms) and supraliminal (170 ms) presentations in a male sample. Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the right fusiform gyrus, precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus in response to subliminal, and the right precuneus, left middle occipital, bilateral lingual, right superior, and left middle temporal gyri in response to supraliminal faces of disgust. Significantly activated voxels were also detected in the bilateral posterior cingulate and right anterior cingulate gyri and the left cerebellum. In addition, supraliminal disgust activated bilateral insulae, while subliminal disgust did not. Subliminal presentations of disgust activated the right thalamus and putamen. Suslow et al. ( ) also used backwardly masked disgusted faces (17 ms) in healthy adult men and women. The subliminal faces of disgust generated clusters in the bilateral anterior cerebellum and the cerebellal lingual. \n\n\n### Studies With Clinical Samples \n  \nThe participants in Dannlowski et al. ( ) suffered from acute major depression. They described clusters of significant activation in both the left and right amygdala for subliminal sad faces vs. neutral faces, and for subliminal angry faces vs. neutral faces. In contrast, the subliminally presented happy faces did not elicit significant changes in brain activation in comparison to neutral faces. No activation by masked happy faces could be detected in comparison with the neutral face baseline. However, when compared to a no-face baseline, masked happy faces were associated with activations in the right amygdala. In participants with an acute major depressive episode, amygdala responses to masked sad faces were greater than responses to masked happy faces (Suslow et al.,  ). The bilateral amygdala responses to subliminal faces expressing sadness were also significantly greater than the bilateral amygdala responses seen in healthy control subjects shown subliminal sad faces. In contrast, the healthy control group had greater bilateral amygdala responses to happy compared with sad faces and compared with the depressed group's bilateral amygdala responses to happy faces. \n\nRedlich et al. ( ) used fMRI to investigate the automatic processing of subliminally presented emotional faces in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in a control sample of MDD patients treated with pharmacotherapy and in a healthy control sample. Both MDD groups had increased bilateral amygdala activity to sad faces compared to the healthy control group at baseline. There was no significant difference for the happy face condition between the groups at baseline. After ~6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, both MDD groups displayed a reduced bilateral amygdala activity in reaction to subliminal sad faces. The pharmacotherapy MDD group also demonstrated a significant increase in amygdala activity to subliminal happy faces, but the ECT MDD group did not. Moreover, no significant differences in amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces compared to controls was detected after 6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, indicating a normalization of the MDD patient groups. \n\nIn Ottaviani et al. ( ), healthy control participants showed bilateral amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces, while participants with panic disorder did not. Masked fearful faces elicited higher amygdala responses than masked neutral faces. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present ALE meta-analysis explored neural activation in response to subliminal emotional faces during fMRI and found bilateral clusters of activation in the amygdala across all studies, as well as those that only examined healthy participants, and those only using whole brain analyses. Meta-analysis one, combining ROI studies with both clinical and non-clinical samples demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, with a higher percentage of studies reporting right amygdala activation. Meta-analysis two, which only examined non-clinical samples also reported bilateral amygdala, converging equally on left and right. Finally, meta-analysis three presented only whole-brain studies, and again demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, most often reported by studies on the right side. Moreover, the narrative review highlighted how the degree of positive or negative affect of the subliminally presented faces may elicit different patterns of neural activation. In particular, increased activation was observed across corticolimbic regions, but predominantly visual cortex areas in response to general subliminal emotional faces. Fearful and happy faces tended to activate bilateral limbic regions ( ). Of the studies examining sad and angry faces, a potentially right-specific amygdala/fusiform area response was detected. Surprise and disgust appeared to activate subcortical regions in the few studies that examined these emotions. \n\n### Right-Lateralized Amygdala Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nAccording to the affective circumplex model, emotions contain two independent dimensions: valence (the negative or positive nature of the emotion) and arousal (the heightened physiological activity caused by the emotion), which activate distinct neural pathways (Posner et al.,  ; Gerber et al.,  ). The subcortically located amygdala has long been considered a key region for processing faces and their emotions, as lesions within the amygdala can severely impair emotion recognition (Adolphs et al.,  ). The amygdala has also been suggested to encode the different dimensions of emotion in a lateralized manner (Wang et al.,  ). The right amygdala may preferentially subserve the uncertainty of a stimulus' valence, while the left may decode the emotional arousal of a stimulus (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Colibazzi et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). When contrasting subliminal and supraliminal emotion processing, the right amygdala has been implicated in automatic responses to emotion, while the left amygdala is activated during conscious reflection following emotional stimuli (Dyck et al.,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). A potential explanatory model could therefore involve a right amygdala-driven automatic and global emotional response, followed by a left amygdala-driven differentiated emotional reaction which incorporates information on arousal to further guide cognition and behavior (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). \n\nThe present findings of significant ALE clusters within the right amygdala, based on the reviewed non-clinical ROI studies and the whole brain studies, slightly differ from the bilateral activation following subliminal emotional faces found in Brooks et al. ( ). However, while Brooks et al. ( ) argued for more robust right amygdala activation, prior imaging studies have also reported elevated left amygdala activation in response to emotionally arousing stimuli such as facial expressions (Morris et al.,  ; Lane et al.,  ; Vytal and Hamann,  ). More specifically, left amygdala activation has been associated with fearful facial expressions (Hardee et al.,  ). However, of the 10 reviewed studies using fearful face masks, the reports of significant amygdala activation were mixed. Liddell et al. ( ) and Yang et al. ( ) reported bilateral amygdala activity with greater right lateralization. Etkin et al. ( ) and Chen et al. ( ) also reported right amygdala activation. Conversely, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant left amygdala activation, while Phillips et al. ( ), Mathiak et al. ( ) Suslow et al. ( ), Cui et al. ( ), and Pichon et al. ( ), did not detect significantly altered amygdala activity in either hemisphere for the subliminal fear conditions. The significant right amygdala clusters detected at group level may therefore be due to the different emotional face expressions, e.g., happiness and sadness, used across the included non-clinical ROI studies. Likewise, the experimental designs of the 14 studies included in the whole brain analysis used subliminal faces with varying emotional valence which could underlie variance in amygdala activation. \n\n\n### Right Parahippocampal Gyrus Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nTwo of the conducted ALE analyses, including whole brain studies analyzed separately, revealed significant right-lateralized activation which could be interpreted as merging onto the parahippocampal gyrus, which is located anteromedially to the amygdala and adjacent to the hippocampus. In addition to the amygdala-centered network, the hippocampus-centered network plays a pivotal role in emotion processing (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). By integrating emotional information from the amygdala,   via   the ACC, the hippocampal complex modulates the consolidation and retrieval of emotional memories (Carlson et al.,  ; Bian et al.,  ). The parahippocampal gyrus takes part in the limbic system and its activation together with the amygdala is in accordance with previous ALE meta-analyses on implicit emotion processing (Li et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ), Interestingly, Shi et al. ( ) found that masking tasks were associated with parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala activation, while inattention tasks of implicit emotional processing preferentially activated the fusiform gyrus. The different activation patterns elicited by masking tasks and inattention tasks, respectively, suggest that the former targets early stages of emotional processing while the latter captures a later stage of pre-attentive emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). The results provide support for the ability of emotional faces to rapidly activate subcortical brain regions, before cortical structures are recruited to evaluate the emotional stimulus and coordinate an appropriate response (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). \n\nParadigms using supraliminal emotional stimuli (e.g., emotionally evocative sentences), have detected strong associations between elevated amygdala and parahippocampal activity and arousal ratings (Colibazzi et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). Indeed, emotional arousal is a well-established mediator in memory consolidation   via   the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network (Dolcos et al.,  ). The current findings of clusters with significant activation within the right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus for subliminal emotional faces, suggests how non-conscious stimuli may influence memory formation and thereby guide behaviors by facilitating the recognition of familiar faces and the emotions they may be expressing. For example, attentional biases toward masked fearful faces may predispose individuals to anxiety or exacerbate sensations of threat, despite being in a safe environment (Carlson et al.,  ). This may in turn lead to a generalization of contextual fear, as seen in posttraumatic stress disorder, which can severely impact everyday life (Bian et al.,  ). \n\nAnger has previously been associated with activations of the right parahippocampal gyrus (Vytal and Hamann,  ). Here, Nomura et al. ( ) and Dannlowski et al. ( ) did not report significant changes in parahippocampal gyrus activity during masked anger conditions. However, surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus (Duan et al.,  ), whereas fearful face primes generated left parahippocampal gyrus activation (Pichon et al.,  ). Victor et al. ( ) detected gender differences with female participants demonstrating elevated BOLD responses to masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus, compared to male participants. Functional interaction studies have proposed distinct amygdala neural signatures associated with supraliminal facial expressions of different emotions (Diano et al.,  ). As the current meta-analysis did not conduct separate ALE analyses for each subliminally presented emotion, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the valence lateralization hypothesis, where the left processes positively valenced stimuli and the right processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, the indications of right-lateralized amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus activity from the reviewed ROI studies and whole brain studies, regardless of emotional valence, suggests that the right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis may apply to subliminal processing as well (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). \n\n\n### Right Striatum Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nSome studies reported in the narrative review demonstrate increased activation to subliminal emotional faces in the striatum. The striatum is comprised of the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and is primarily known for its role in voluntary motor control (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Neuroimaging work has highlighted the striatum's involvement in integrating social information and reward processes (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Moreover, the ventral striatum has been found to be more sensitive to subliminally presented faces in comparison to supraliminally presented faces (Ito et al.,  ). \n\nDuring emotion identification, the striatum has been suggested to act in opposition to the amygdala (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). For example, while the amygdala may preferentially react to threatening angry or fearful faces, the striatum may be tuned to detect non-threatening sad or happy faces (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). While two of the studies in the current review reported increased putamen and nucleus accumbens activation in response to masked happy faces (Duan et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ), three reported putamen and caudate activation in response to masked negative emotions (Phillips et al.,  ; Liddell et al.,  ; Dannlowski et al.,  ). Despite the mixed emotional valences, the right striatum activation seen in the reviewed studies, suggests that subliminal face processing is not only important for threat perception but also for drawing our attention to cues which could lead to social rewards, such as social inclusion (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). \n\n\n### Clinical Samples of Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder \n  \nMood disorders are often characterized by emotional dysfunctions which manifest as abnormal affective processing and behaviors, such as altered reward appraisal and negative attentional biases (Diekhof et al.,  ). When it comes to face processing, depressed patients may have trouble recognizing neutral faces and have been shown to wrongfully ascribe sadness to supraliminal neutral expressions (Lepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ). Prior work has attributed these depression-related tendencies to amygdala hyperactivity, but it is not yet established whether this aberrant processing should be regarded as a causal factor or a clinical manifestation of depression (Stuhrmann et al.,  ). Intriguingly, a hyperactive amygdala state can also be detected during the subliminal presentations of sad faces, as indicated by the reviewed studies with MDD patients (Dannlowski et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ; Redlich et al.,  ). The MDD participants also had greater amygdala responses to masked sad faces in comparison to masked happy faces, while the opposite was seen for the healthy controls (Suslow et al.,  ). \n\nA previous ALE meta-analysis comparing MDD patients and healthy volunteers also found different brain activation patterns depending on the stimulus valence (emotional faces or words; Groenewold et al.,  ). Negative stimuli elicited greater activation in the right amygdala, left striatum, dorsal anterior cingulate and parahippocampal areas in the MDD participants. The same brain regions were activated in response to positive stimuli, but to a lesser extent than the healthy controls (Groenewold et al.,  ). The opposing neural activation patterns, with the amygdala highly tuned to negative information (Murray et al.,  ), and lower activity in the ventral striatum tuned to positive information (Diekhof et al.,  ), support a negative attention bias in depression where negative stimuli may be preferentially processed (Gotlib et al.,  ). Given that subliminal faces expressing sadness may also elicit elevated amygdala responses in MDD patients, as seen in Suslow et al. ( ) and Redlich et al. ( ), it is emphasized how depression-relevant information may be subconsciously processed and is therefore difficult to change. However, Redlich et al. ( ) demonstrated how amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces can be normalized in MDD patients following 6 weeks of ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy. This highlights the possibilities of altering dysfunctional emotional face processing in mood disorders. \n\nIn contrast to the above findings from MDD patients, participants with panic disorder did not show amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces in Ottaviani et al. ( ). Although the masked fearful faces did elicit higher amygdala responses than the masked neutral faces. Patients with panic disorder suffer from recurrent panic attacks, accompanying physical symptoms such as an increased pulse or chest pain, and anticipatory anxiety (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Supraliminal presentations of emotional faces have previously generated increased amygdala activation in participants with anxiety disorders when viewing fearful faces relative to happy faces, compared with healthy controls (Fonzo et al.,  ). Furthermore, anxiety-prone individuals have been shown to have significantly higher bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces (Stein et al.,  ). A hyperactive insula has also been associated with panic disorder diagnoses (Fonzo et al.,  ). The insula is associated with interoceptive processes which signal internal body states (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Elevated insula activity may therefore reflect an increased sensitivity to distressing body sensations in individuals with panic disorder (Fonzo et al.,  ). As Ottaviani et al. ( ) relied on a ROI-based analysis for the amygdala only, no results were reported for the insula. \n\n\n### Strengths and Limitations \n  \nA major strength of the current study is the use of ALE methodology which addresses the difficulties with meta-analyzing fMRI studies, due to the different statistical contrasts used in creating neural activation images. An additional strength is that the right amygdala activation (extending into the right parahippocampal gyrus) remained significant when the analysis was re-run without the ROI studies, which strengthens the findings. However, the ALE approach does not account for the intensity of the BOLD signal reported in each study. It is also possible that differences in the fMRI set-ups and participant instructions could have influenced the results. The results may also have been affected by differences in the sample demographics. For example, Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) only tested women, while Phillips et al. ( ) and Mathiak et al. ( ) only included men. However, there were not enough studies to conduct an ALE to examine gender differences. \n\nThe studies in the current meta-analysis all used masking tasks which have been proven useful for examining the early stages of implicit emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). Of note, binocular rivalry and interocular suppression approaches can also be used in the study of emotional face processing, but this meta-analysis only included studies using masking tasks (Alpers and Gerdes,  ; Yang and Yeh,  ). The studies presented the masks for 40 ms or shorter, which is deemed sufficient to prevent the conscious detection of the prime stimulus (Esteves and \u00d6hman,  ). However, detection of non-conscious primes can occur below 40 ms (Szczepanowski and Pessoa,  ), which is why it is important to pair the masking tasks with a subsequent detection task to ensure that the participants did not perceive the masked stimulus. Both subjective and objective criteria to test the potential awareness of the prime were used across the reviewed studies ( ). Some studies relied solely on subjective reports of visual awareness (e.g., Duan et al.,  ; Mathiak et al.,  ; Prochnow et al.,  ). Other studies used objective discrimination thresholds where unaware perception was defined as by chance performance in forced-choice detection tasks (e.g., Liddell et al.,  ; Ottaviani et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). As information about the non-conscious stimulus may only be accessible for a limited time, it may fade before visual awareness can be self-reported and lead to incorrect assumptions being made for the subliminal experimental conditions. Therefore, objective criteria may be more suitable as a determinant (Pessoa et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). However, running sub-analyses for studies using objective or subjective criteria was unfortunately not possible due to the limited number of whole brain studies in this ALE. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first ALE meta-analysis focusing on fMRI studies of subliminal emotional face processing. Clusters of significant activation were detected in bilateral amygdala, with most study convergence in the right amygdala, in response to non-consciously presented multi-valenced images of faces. Given the integral role of the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network in memory formation, it is compelling to consider how these brain regions may be activated without conscious awareness. An impaired ability to interpret emotional facial cues may be particularly worrisome for individuals suffering from mental health conditions. Future fMRI studies of non-consciously presented, multi-valenced affective stimuli will be important in delineating the implicated neural pathways in both functional and dysfunctional states. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAD: manuscript preparation, investigation, formal analysis, and data curation.

{"text": "Zapparoli, Laura and Seghezzi, Silvia and Paulesu, Eraldo\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nThe What, the When, and the Whether of Intentional Action in the Brain: A Meta-Analytical Review\n\n# Keywords\n\nintentional action\nmotor control\nfMRI\nPET\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIn their attempt to define discrete subcomponents of intentionality, Brass and Haggard ( ) proposed their   What, When, and Whether model   (  www  -  model  ) which postulates that the content, the timing and the possibility of generating an action can be partially independent both at the cognitive level and at the level of their neural implementation. The original proposal was based on a limited number of studies, which were reviewed with a discursive approach. To assess whether the model stands in front of the more recently published data, we performed a systematic review of the literature with a meta-analytic method based on a hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm. We identified 15 PET/fMRI studies well-suited for this quest. HC revealed the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the medial prefrontal cortex, with the more anterior regions (the anterior cingulum) involved in more abstract decisions of whether to execute an action and the more posterior ones (the middle cingulum or the SMA) recruited in specifying the content and the timing components of actions. However, in contrast with the original   www  -model, this dissociation involves also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe, in a component specific manner: the supramarginal gyrus for the   what   component, the pallidum and the thalamus for the   when   component, the putamen and the insula for the   whether   component. We then calculated co-activation maps on the three component-specific   www   clusters of the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe: to this end, we used the activation likelihood approach that we applied on the imaging studies on action contained in the BrainMap.org database. This analysis confirmed the main findings of the HC analyses. However, the BrainMap.org data analyses also showed that the aforementioned segregations are generated by paradigms in which subjects act in response to conditional stimuli rather than while driven by their own intentions. We conclude that the available data confirm that the neural underpinnings of intentionality can be fractionated in discrete components that are partially independent. We also suggest that intentionality manifests itself in discrete components through the boosting of general purpose action-related regions specialized for different aspects of action selection and inhibition. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMotor control has been the object of interest of many disciplines, including psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and, since the earliest days, philosophy, particularly when the object of enquiry are the conscious aspects of motor control and intentionality (Jeannerod,  ; Frith et al.,  ; Haggard,  ). \n\nA comprehensive model that differentiates the various stages of movement production is not available: even articulated models of motor control (see for example Frith et al.,  ) remain underspecified, especially when considering the intentional components and their neural implementation. \n\nIn an earlier attempt to provide a model of the brain bases of intentionality, Jahanshahi ( ) argued that, in principle, it should be possible to characterize intentional actions in at least three main components: the content (  what   component), the timing (  when   component) and the possibility of being executed or inhibited (  whether   component). However, in reviewing the then available neuroimaging literature, they concluded that there was no sufficient evidence that such components are represented in discrete brain circuits. In their unitary brain model of intentionality, they proposed a \u201csystem\u201d for intentional actions located in the pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA), with subcortical inputs coming from the striatum and through the thalamus: in their views, these systems are responsible for the all three features of intentional action (Jahanshahi,  ). \n\nTen years later, Brass and Haggard ( ) re-assessed the early insights of Jahanshahi ( ) and, taking advantage of a larger set of imaging data, proposed that a \u201cWhat, When, and Whether\u201d model (  www-model  )  of intentional action is justified also on anatomical grounds. The original   www-model   was based on a set of experiments that we review here briefly together with more recent observations. \n\n### \u201c  What  \u201d component \n  \nThe   What   component has been mostly investigated by using fMRI procedures similar to the \u201cFree selection paradigm\u201d (Lau et al.,  ), in which two experimental conditions are compared: a condition in which responses are externally determined by a cue and a condition in which the participants have to choose freely between different motor responses. Typically, the   What   component has been related with the activation of the fronto-medial cortex at the level of the rostral cingulate zone (Deiber et al.,  ; Frith et al.,  ; Hyder et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  , ; Mueller et al.,  ; Krieghoff et al.,  ), the SMA (Lau H. C. et al.,  ; van Eimeren et al.,  ) and pre-SMA (Deiber et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  , ; Brass and Haggard,  ). \n\n\n### \u201c  When  \u201d component \n  \nThe timing component of intentional actions has been investigated by using the paradigm of Libet (Libet et al.,  ). For example, Lau et al. ( ) associated the judgment of the onset of the intention to move with activation of the pre-SMA (Lau et al.,  ). Libet' s paradigm has a number of limitations (see for example Trevena and Miller,  ; Lau H. et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ), first and foremost, of being meta-cognitive in nature and perhaps not terribly well-suited to fMRI given the temporal resolution of the technique and the time scale of the neurophysiological events seen with EEG during the paradigm. \n\nThe   When   component has been explored also by Jahanshahi et al. ( ) and Jenkins et al. ( ) who compared self-initiated extensions of the index finger with fingers' extensions triggered by pacing tones at unpredictable intervals: they found an activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specifically for the self-paced condition (Jahanshahi et al.,  ; Jenkins et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, in an early and solitary attempt to dissociate the anatomical bases of the   What   and the   When   components in the same experiment, Hoffstaedter et al. ( ) manipulated the content and the timing of the motor responses of their participants. They found activations of the SMA, the insula, the globus pallidus, and the anterior putamen in relation to the free selection of the action's timing and the activation of the pre-SMA and the dorsal premotor cortex in relation to the free selection of the actions' content (Hoffstaedter et al.,  ). \n\n\n### \u201c  Whether  \u201d component \n  \nThe absence of a motor response as the result of the choice of action inhibition has partly hindered the study of the intentional inhibition processes with an explicit experimental task. The Libet' s task has been the main paradigm used to investigate voluntary inhibition. Using fMRI, Brass and Haggard have shown that an area of the dorsal and rostral fronto-medial cortex is more active when participants intentionally inhibit a response rather than when they complete the same action (Brass and Haggard,  ). In any event, the voluntary inhibition of actions has been recently studied also with novel tasks like in the case of the   marble task   (K\u00fchn et al.,  ; Schel et al.,  ) or the motivation driven   pain avoidance paradigm   of Lynn et al. ( ). These experiments showed that intentional inhibition rely on a neural network that includes parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally (K\u00fchn et al.,  ; Schel et al.,  ) and the pre-SMA (Schel et al.,  ; Lynn et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Aims of the study \n  \nAfter the initial proposal of the   www-model  , some new ground has been covered with new explicit experiments to justify a formal assessment of the model, this time with explicit meta-analytical techniques. \n\nIs the segregation of different components of the   www-model   justified by the new evidence? If so, does it involve specific portions of the medial wall of the frontal lobe and of the cingulate gyrus? Further, does the mapping of the discrete components involve other brain regions in a specific manner? Again, if so, is it possible, with all the needed caution, to infer from these additional regions on the nature of the subcomponents of intentionality postulated by the original model? \n\nFurther, are the regions involved in intentionality anatomically specific or do they simply contribute to this aspect of behavior while being also involved in conditional aspects of action selection? \n\nThese were all lingering questions on the   www-model   that we tried to address in the present study. To this end, we first used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify component specific clusters. As the reader will see, the specific literature available is barely sufficient to make statistical inferences on the significance of the clusters identified. However, after the initial hierarchical clustering procedure, we interrogated the vast BrainMap.org database and generated co-activation maps based on the main component-specific medial wall clusters of the frontal lobe. This permitted the desired statistical assessment of the anatomical dissociations initially identified by hierarchical clustering. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data collection and preparation \n  \nOur meta-analysis was based on neuroimaging articles investigating the neurofunctional correlates of intentional action using PET or fMRI in adult subjects. \n\nCandidate studies were selected through the PubMed database ( ). The search keys were: \u201cIntentional action & fMRI\u201d and \u201cIntentional action & PET.\u201d These queries returned 27 neuroimaging articles investigating the neurofunctional correlates of intentional actions. We included only studies that did satisfy the following inclusion criteria: (1) sample population composed of normal adult subjects; (2) imaging technique: PET or fMRI; (3) data reported using stereotactic coordinates; (4) comparison between intentional actions and stimulus-driven actions. As a consequence of these inclusion criteria, 12 studies were excluded from the analysis. Among the 15 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, 6 studies investigated the   What   component, 3 studies the   When   component, and 4 studies the   Whether   component. Finally, 2 studies investigated both the   What   and the   When   components. These studies were then classified on the basis of the examined component (see Supplementary Table  ). \n\nFor the suitable studies, in the meta-analysis we used data derived from (i) within group   simple effects   and (ii) interaction effects. The simple effects were: \u201cIntention driven trials\u201d and \u201cStimulus driven trials.\u201d The interaction effects  were \u201cIntention driven trials > Stimulus driven trials\u201d and vice versa. As there were no sufficient local maxima for the contrasts designed to identify the stimulus driven acts, these were not analyzed any further. \n\nTo summarize, the data selection led us to analyse 150 stereotactic activation loci,   71   peaks associated with the   What   component,   42   peaks with the When component and   37   peaks with the Whether component of intentional actions. \n\n\n### Classification of the raw data prior to clustering analyses \n  \nFor each activation peak, we recorded all relevant information about the statistical comparison that generated it, the nature of the experimental task and the investigated component. \n\nWe therefore determined a list of classification criteria to characterize each peak of activation included in the dataset:\n   \n\u2013 t-values or z-scores; \n  \n\u2013 Sample size; \n  \n\u2013 Average age of the subjects; \n  \n\u2013 Stereotactic template (MNI or Tailarach and Tournoux template); \n  \n\u2013 Whole brain or region-of-interest analysis; \n  \n\u2013 Scanning Technique (PET or fMRI); \n  \n\u2013 Statistical thresholds and nature of the correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\nIn order to combine the data coming from studies based on different stereotactic spaces, the stereotactic coordinates of studies in which activation peaks were reported in terms of the Talairach and Tournoux ( ) atlas were transformed into the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) stereotactic space using Matthew Brett's procedure as implemented in the software GingerAle ( ). \n\n\n### Clustering procedure \n  \nWe first performed a component specific hierarchical clustering analyses (HC) of the activation peaks: the analysis allowed us to extract the principal clusters of regional effects from the database (Cattinelli et al.,  ) for each www component. \n\nHierarchical clustering was performed by using functions implemented in MATLAB 2016a. After computation of squared Euclidean distances between each pair of the input data, clusters with minimal dissimilarity were recursively merged using Ward's ( ) criterion which minimizes total intra-cluster variance after each merging step. As described in Cattinelli et al. ( ) and Crepaldi et al. ( ), \u201c  this procedure results in a tree, whose leaves represent singletons (i.e., clusters formed of a single activation peak), and whose root represents one large cluster including all the activation peaks submitted to the algorithm. Each level of the tree reports the clusters created by the algorithm at a specific processing step, as it progresses from individual activation peaks at the lowest level to the all-inclusive final cluster at the top of the tree.\u201d   The procedure was continued until the average standard deviation around the cluster centroids of the individual peaks, in the   x, y  , and   z   directions, remained below 5.0 mm. This measure roughly mimics the spatial resolution of fMRI studies. As hierarchical clustering may be sensitive to the order in which the individual data are processed, and may generate alternative clustering trees when integers are used (Morgan and Ray,  ), an optimal clustering solution was identified by accepting the solution with maximized the between cluster error sum of squares (see for example Cattinelli et al.,  ). The mean coordinates of each cluster included in the final set were then passed as an input to a MATLAB script to automatically label the anatomical correspondence of the stereotactic coordinates of the centroids of each cluster. This procedure implied a query of the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template available in the MRIcron visualization Software (Rorden and Brett,  ). The initial automatic anatomical assignations were then double-checked by the authors with direct visual inspection on the AAL template and, if needed, the corresponding volumetric MRI scan template Ch2Bet released with the MRIcron software. \n\nGiven the number of peaks available for each analysis, relevant clusters at this stage were identified on the basis of the numerosity of the peaks in each cluster. Clusters were further considered if they contained a number of coordinates greater than the median of the distribution for each analysis and, in any event, with no <3 coordinates. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood analyses \n  \nTo assess to what extent the functional segregations identified by the HC analyses could be replicated on a much larger dataset of studies on action, we interrogated the BrainMap.org database to generate co-activation maps for the   What, When  , and   Whether   patterns using the Activation Likelihood Estimate approach (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Co-activation maps are essentially estimates of the probability that local effects, expressed as triplets of stereotactic coordinates, co-occur in a data-set together with the activation of a seed reference region. The advantage of the ALE approach is that the statistical significance of the clusters identified is assessed using formal statistical thresholding. In this case, three separate co-activation maps were calculated using as seeds the three specific clusters identified in the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe, as they were also postulated in the original www-model. The interrogation of the BrainMap.org database was performed by using a 10 mm wide 3D region of interest defined around the centroid of each cluster (the coordinates are indicated in bold font in Table  ). \n  \n Hierarchical clustering analysis  . \n  \nIn BOLD the stereotactic coordinates used as centroids for subsequent the co-activation maps analyses using the Activation Likelihood Estimate technique. \n  \nWe interrogated all the studies that in the database are classified with the key-word \u201c  action  \u201d and \u201c  activation  .\u201d \n\nThe aim of these analyses was three-fold: (1) on the one hand we wanted to test the hypothesis that co-activation maps generated starting from the three main clusters of the medial wall of the frontal lobe and of the cingulate cortex can produce similarly segregated results as in the specific hierarchical clustering, once the three maps were formally compared (2) further, we wanted to test the hypothesis on whether the brain regions outside the frontal lobe would co-vary with the original seeds in a similar manner (3) by analyzing the composition of the BrainMap.org data-base experiments, that contributed to the identification of medial-wall clusters, we wanted to learn to what extent these could be associated, even if loosely, to intentional action and its subcomponents at the center of our quest. \n\nAs an initial step, three separate co-activation maps were calculated for each of the three seed clusters identified by the HC procedure. Subsequently, each co-activation map was compared with the other two lumped together. \n\nFurthermore, once a component specific cluster was identified in the BrainMap.org database, we explored its composition as far as the generative paradigms was concerned. We paid particular attention to the relative contribution of go/no-go paradigms as these are closer to aspects of motor control entailed by the intentional/conditional dichotomy, particularly for the whether component. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Hierarchical clustering \n  \nFor the    what    component the data clustered in the right middle cingulum, the right frontal middle gyrus, the right supramarginal gyrus and the left inferior triangular frontal gyrus (see Table   and Figure  ). \n  \n Hierarchical clustering analysis results for (A)   the what component;   (B)   the when component;   (C)   the whether component and a summary of all the components on the medial view of the brain. \n  \nFor the    when    component we found clusters in the right SMA, the right frontal middle gyrus, in the right inferior parietal lobule, in the right rolandic operculum, in the left inferior opercular frontal gyrus and in the lenticular nucleus bilaterally (see Table   and Figure  ). \n\nFinally, for the    whether    component, specific clusters were seen at the level of the right anterior and the left middle cingulum, the left inferior orbital frontal gyrus, the right insula and subcortical structures, such as the thalamus and the putamen (see Table   and Figure  ). \n\n\n### Co-activation maps \n  \nThe BrainMap.org search for co-activations on the   What, When  , and   Whether   clusters of the medial frontal lobe wall (based on the centroids in bold in Table  ) retrieved 1,201 foci from 56 statistical comparisons for the   What   cluster, 1,488 foci from 73 statistical comparisons for the   When   cluster, and 614 foci from 24 statistical comparisons for the   Whether   component. \n\nFigure   illustrates the co-activation maps calculated around the original clusters used as seeds for the interrogation of the BrainMap.org database (statistical threshold   p   < 0.05 FDR corrected). \n  \n Co-activations maps calculated with ALE for (A)   the what component;   (B)   the when component;   (C)   the whether component and a summary of all the components on the medial view of the brain. \n  \nIt should be noted that when seen as simple effects (e.g., the co-activation map generated by the    what    seed alone) most of the regions implicated by the HC analysis were also identified by the co-activation maps analysis (regions indicated with the symbol   in Table  ). Their relative segregation and embedding is illustrated in Figure  . \n\nEach individual map was then compared with a combination of the other two maps: for example, the    What    map vs.    When    &    Whether    ones combined, and so forth. For these comparisons, a more lenient   p   < 0.005 uncorrected threshold (cluster size threshold 300 mm ) was used. \n\nThese analyses led to identification of regions that genuinely dissociate on the basis of their co-activation with the seeds used. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure   and summarized in Tables  , the comparative co-activation maps analysis confirms the functional dissociation along the medial wall of the frontal lobe, in a caudo-rostral direction, into a   what, when, and whether   components. Together with these brain regions, there were co-segregations of component-specific regions, particularly for the lenticular nuclei for the   when   component (see Figures   for a comparison between the two analyses). \n  \n Comparison of the dissociation between components assessed with (A)   hierarchical clustering analysis results and   (B)   ALE co-activation maps. \n    \n Co-activation maps analyses  . \n  \n A, What > (When and Whether) from seed at x = 4; y = 20; z = 38  . \n\n B, When > (What and Whether) from seed at x = 5; y = \u22123; z = 62  . \n\n C, Whether > (What and When) from seed at x = \u22121; y = 29; z = 35  . \n  \nWe also assessed whether the foci that contributed to the segregation of the component specific clusters of the median wall of the frontal lobe were associated with specific tasks. Tables   describes the nature of the tasks behind the regional effects. First, it should be noted that these did not contain foci from the studies that were entered in the present meta-analysis. Second, after an initial qualitative scrutiny, we compared the relative prevalence of go/no-go paradigms vs. other kind of paradigms. \n  \n Composition analysis of the medial frontal wall clusters isolated by the comparative co-activation maps analyses performed on the BrainMap.org dataset  . \n  \n The table reports the comparison of the proportion of regional effects derived from go/no-go paradigms and all other paradigms within each of the three clusters from the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe  . \n\n A, Chi-Squared Test\u2014What vs. When  . \n\n B, Chi-Squared Test\u2014Whether vs. When  . \n\n C, Chi-Squared Test\u2014Whether vs. What  . \n  \nWe then performed three Chi-squared pairwise comparisons between component specific cluster compositions to find that the relative prevalence of go/no-go data was significantly greater for the   whether   and   what   clusters in comparison with the data that generated the   when   cluster (see Table  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nContrary to previous anatomically \u201cunitary\u201d models of willed action (Jahanshahi,  ), Brass and Haggard ( ) proposed the existence of a distributed meso-frontal system, responsible for discrete aspects of intentionality, encoding what to do, when to do it or whether or not to do it. However, in both the cited models, the authors based their conclusions on a qualitative analysis of the available PET/fMRI literature, characterized by a number of different experimental approaches. \n\nThe current meta-analytic study was conducted in order to further test these alternative neurocognitive models of intentional action, by formally exploring, as quantitatively as possible, the available literature. The results of our combination of hierarchical clustering and ALE meta-analytical procedures expands the initial model of Brass and Haggard ( ) showing that (1) a segregation of intention specific regions is possible even though the regions involved go beyond the mesial wall of the frontal lobe; (2) the regions involved coincide with brain areas that are active also for conditional (non-intentional) motor behaviors. This latter finding suggests that intentionality manifests itself in discrete components through the boosting of general purpose action-related regions specialized for different aspects of action selection and inhibition. \n\n### A multi-component neural model of intentionality \n  \nOur results partially confirm the assumption of Brass and Haggard's model (2008), suggesting the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the medial prefrontal cortex, with the more anterior regions involved in more abstract decisions of whether to execute an action and the more posterior ones recruited in specifying the content and, yet more dorsally, the timing components of actions. \n\nFor example, for the decision about which action to perform (  what   component) the data clustered at the level of the right middle cingulum; the middle cingulum has been previously associated to conflict processing and conflict monitoring (Botvinick et al.,  ; Carter and van Veen,  ) and it could contribute to the specific resolution of an internal conflict about which action to execute among different alternatives. \n\nFor what concerns the decision about the timing of the action, we found a cluster in the right SMA; this region has been previously explicitly linked to the timing or to the intentional initiation of a movement (Cunnington et al.,  ; Debaere et al.,  ). The association between the SMA and timing of intentional action is supported by recent studies on Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by difficulties in implementing intentional behaviors, but this impairment is reduced in the presence of an external salient cue, such as, for example, a fire (Jahanshahi,  ); for this reason, it has been widely hypothesized that PD patients have a malfunctioning of the internal timing of action (Brass and Haggard,  ). In PD patients, the SMA has abnormal connectivity with the thalamus, especially during the OFF-medication phase (Michely et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, the studies investigating the intentional decision about whether or not to act converged in a cluster at the level of the right cingulum in its anterior portion, a region more anterior than the ones involved in the other two components. This finding confirms that the intentional inhibition of an action involves separate neural structures fleshing out the concept that deciding whether to act or not is separable from other aspects of intentionality. \n\n\n### Going beyond the frontal mesial cortex \n  \nIn contrast with the original www-model, the dissociations for the different components involved also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe, in a component specific manner. \n\nFor example, for the   what   component the data clustered at the level of the right supramarginal gyrus, a finding confirmed by the co-activation maps analysis. The involvement of the parietal lobule in the decision about which action to execute should not be a surprise: the inferior parietal lobules are in fact critical nodes for the representation of actions and intentions to act according to previous findings (Tunik et al.,  ). Recently, Gallivan et al. ( ) showed that intentions for specific movements could be predicted by the spatial activity patterns in these areas. Moreover, direct electrical stimulation of the right inferior parietal lobule induces a strong intention to move; at relatively high stimulation intensities (~8 mA) patients may even feel an illusory sense of movement (Desmurget et al.,  ). Thus, in the context of intentional action, the parietal lobule seems to contribute to movement intention and motor awareness with specific reference to specific body parts. \n\nFor what concerns the internal timing of the action, a specific cluster was found in the frontal operculum, a structure previously associated with the synchronization of voluntary hand movements to an auditory rhythm (Thaut,  ). It is also telling the involvement of the motor component of the lenticular nuclei bilaterally: these are of course part of a cortico-subcortical-cortical network that regulates motor behavior (Graybiel,  ) and that is dysfunctional in movement disorders (see review in Crittenden and Graybiel,  ). \n\nFinally, for the   whether   component, our data clustered also at the level of the right anterior insula; anterior insula activations have been reported in various studies on response inhibition (Wager et al.,  ). Moreover, there is evidence indicating that anterior insula is associated with concentration and \u201ccognitive effort\u201d (Allen et al.,  ): if so, its involvement in this class of tasks, may represent the strain to decide whether to do or not to do something after this has already been planned. \n\nWe found two more clusters associated with the whether component, at the level of the thalamus and the putamen; the thalamus, and the basal ganglia in general, are known to play a crucial role in action selection (Humphries and Gurney,  ; Humphries et al.,  ). The specific involvement of such structures in the intentional inhibition of actions is supported by their abnormal functioning in Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, a movement disorder characterized by the presence of unwanted movements that patients are not usually able to inhibit (see review in Zapparoli et al.,  ): this neurological disease is most likely associated with aberrant activity in the basal ganglia and with functional changes in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits (see Mink,  ; Leckman et al.,  ; Felling and Singer,  ; Ganos et al.,  ). A malfunction of the same circuitry has been described also in the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, see for example Bandelow et al.,  ). The spectrum of OCD symptoms is too broad to be readily accommodated by malfunctions of the www-neural circuitry alone. However, as much as complex motor tics can be very similar to motor compulsions (Worbe et al.,  ), OCD symptoms are frequently observed in patients with Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome. Considerations about their frequent comorbidity suggest that the co-occurrence of the two syndromes may in fact represent a specific clinical entity, the recently defined Obsessive-Compulsive Tic Disorder (OCTD; see Dell'Osso et al.,  ): this may comprise the \u201cmalfunctioning\u201d of the neural systems associated with the   whether   component of intentionality, explaining the difficulty of these patients to inhibit their compulsive/ticking behaviors. \n\n\n### The functional neural correlates of intentional action and of action in general \n  \nThe issue of whether the anatomy of intentional action, and its subcomponents, involves brain regions generally responsible for action was assessed by the co-activation maps analyses. This analysis confirmed the segregation of the clusters along the medial wall and the additional regions seen for the   www   components by our hierarchical clustering analysis. It also confirmed by far and large the extension of component specific regions outside the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe. \n\nA composition analysis of the paradigms that contributed to each of the three clusters of the medial wall of the frontal/limbic lobe  revealed, as one could expect, first and foremost the extreme heterogeneity of the paradigms that were retrieved with the only constraint of the key-words \u201caction\u201d and \u201cactivation\u201d and \u201cnormal subjects\u201d (see the Supplementary Table  ). Having identified the relative proportion of go/no-go paradigms behind each cluster, the   what   and the   whether   ones proved to have a significant larger proportion of such paradigms. Although some aspects of these findings are open to discussion, it is a matter of little surprise to observe that the   whether   component of intentionality maps into a cluster that contains a fair proportion of go/no-go paradigms in a general database of experiments on action. \n\nHowever, the analysis of the paradigms that contributed the raw data for co-activation maps were far from being associated with intentional action experiments only. In fact, at the time of this writing (February 2017), as strange as it might seem , the BrainMap.org database did not contain the 15 studies that were submitted to our hierarchical clustering analysis on the studies on intention. This fortuitous feature was instrumental to our analyses as we were guaranteed that the hierarchical clustering and the co-activation maps analyses were independent, adding validity to our inferences. \n\nIn returning to the crucial matter of our contention here, the fact that the medial wall seeds, on which the co-activation maps analyses were based, segregate in an identical manner to what is revealed by the hierarchical clustering performed on \u201cintentional\u201d experiments, suggests that the specificity of intentionality and its subcomponents cannot be sought   phrenologically   in terms of minute segregated regions exclusively involved in intentionality; on the other hand, the same observation suggests that the   what, when, and whether   segregation for action most likely exists beyond the concept of intentionality. \n\nHowever, it cannot be denied that the presence of an intentional stance during the paradigms meta-analyzed here induced stronger activity in these regions in a component specific manner. This suggests, on the one hand, that intentionality is expressed in these   www   action regions at some microscopical level, perhaps thanks to the boosting effect of some ascending modulatory attentional pathways for tasks in which subjects have to decide how and whether to act by themselves, rather than in reaction to a conditional stimulus. Another possibility is that the relative weights of the connections between the regions involved in the different aspects of intentionality change during intentional action, something that needs to be explored with effective connectivity techniques and that goes beyond the potentials of meta-analyses based on data generated by univariate analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion and future directions \n  \nAfter this meta-analytic review, it is clear that further studies are needed to assess the functional anatomical foundations of the   www-model   of intentionality, in order to overcome the methodological limitations of previous attempts. In particular, we are much in need of novel fMRI experiments in which the sub-components of intentionality, postulated by the above mentioned neurocognitive models, are assessed with an uniform procedure in the same group of subjects. The advantages of a uniform procedure are obvious: significant differences between the intentional tasks in the different conditions should not be confounded by factors (e.g., different populations; different tasks; different scanning protocols) that may hamper the possibility of firm assignations of specific functional anatomical patterns to subcomponents of intentionality. Another unexplored issue is the characterization of intentional actions in conditions in which content, timing and the very decision on whether to act or not are explicitly and jointly manipulated. Furthermore, it remains to be discovered how general-purpose action brain regions become more active when intentionality is operating. This will clearly require analytical approaches that go beyond univariate analyses of the fMRI data. Clearly, one such ambitious model should have some predictive value for pathologies in which a disorder of intentionality and its specific components is expected. Brass and Haggard ( ) speculated about candidate pathologies that may entail a specific disorder of intentionality (e.g., the   when   component in Parkinson's disease). These specific associations also remain to be demonstrated convincingly. However, in spite of all these unsolved issues, we believe that the available literature contains sufficient evidence to think that the   www-model   of intentionality might be a useful starting framework for future investigations. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLZ, SS, and EP reviewed the data for the meta-analyses, performed the analyses, and drafted the manuscript. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5434171, "text_md5": "41cf33da1082bee6fdc1677eff266c88", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 57], "journal": [58, 76], "publication_year": [78, 82], "title": [93, 189], "keywords": [203, 259], "abstract": [272, 2656], "body": [2665, 36591]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 28567010, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2017.00238", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434171", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5434171"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434171\">5434171</a>", "list_title": "PMC5434171  The What, the When, and the Whether of Intentional Action in the Brain: A Meta-Analytical Review"}

Although the medial prefrontal cortex has commonly been associated with choices, there is no consensus on the wider network that underlies diverse intentional decisions and behaviours. Our systematic literature search identified 35 fMRI/PET experiments using various free-choice paradigms, with appropriate control conditions using external instructions. An Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) meta-analysis showed that, compared with external instructions, intentional decisions consistently activate the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the left insula and the inferior parietal lobule. We then categorized the studies into four different types according to their experimental designs: reactive motor intention, perceptual intention, inhibitory intention, and cognitive intention. We conducted conjunction and contrast meta-analyses to identify consistent and selective spatial convergence of brain activation within each specific category of intentional decision. Finally, we used meta-analytic decoding to probe cognitive processes underlying free choices. Our findings suggest that the neurocognitive process underlying intentional decision incorporates anatomically separated components subserving distinct cognitive and computational roles. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTo fulfil our goals or desires, we constantly interact with the external environment through our voluntary behaviour. In contrast to reflexes that are beyond volition (e.g., a knee-jerk reflex), voluntary behaviours are characterised by choice ( ). Volition characterises the intentional choice or decision between multiple options, where the choice is not sufficiently explained by differences in expected or explicit rewards. The concept of intentional decision refers to this fundamental ability of human cognition: acting voluntarily based on internal or endogenous intentions ( ). \n\nThe role of intention in decision-making occupies a broad spectrum. At one extreme lies externally guided perceptual decision such as stopping at a red traffic light, for which the involvement of internal intention is low because learned rules can dictate a correct choice (even if one can voluntarily break such rules). At the other extreme lies improvisational behaviour in music, painting or dance, which can be strongly determined by moment-to-moment intention. In between lies the common scenario of intentional decision-making, where the external environment constrains only which options are available while internal intentions dictate which of those options to choose. The ability to choose actions, cognitive strategies and behaviours in this way plays a key role throughout the life span and is essential to our understanding of human cognition. In child development from birth to 12 months, actions such as grasping and its coordination with vision gradually emerge from simple reflexes ( ;  ;  ). In patients with neurodegenerative disorders, the inability to engage appropriate intentional behaviour can manifest as apathy ( ), impulsivity ( ) and perseveration ( ). In addition, intentional behaviour is a foundation of social interactions via cooperation and collaboration ( ). \n\nIntentional actions have been characterised by three components in the   what  -  when  -  whether   (WWW) model: (1)   what   action to perform, (2)   when   to perform it, and (3)   whether   to perform the chosen act ( ). The WWW model is based on evidence from two interlinked lines of research. First, the   when   component has been investigated by examining neural signatures immediately prior to intentional actions. Libet's intentional action paradigm is a classic example of this type ( ;  ), which has been used to localize electrophysiological and BOLD activity in the medial-frontal cortex preceding the conscious awareness of subsequent voluntary actions ( ;  ) (but see  ;   for critical evaluations). Second, research on the   what   and   whether   components, the focus of the current study, commonly use variants of the \u201cfree-choice\u201d paradigm to determine the neurocognitive mechanisms of voluntary decision processes. In the literature, several terms have been used to refer to the free-choice paradigm, such as \u201cvoluntary selection\u201d ( ), \u201cwilled action\u201d ( ), \u201cinternal selection\u201d ( ), \u201cself-initiated\u201d ( ), and \u201cchosen actions\u201d ( ). The current study uses these terms interchangeably. \n\nIn a typical free-choice paradigm, participants make a voluntary choice from multiple alternatives on each trial. The available alternatives can either be similar to each other (e.g., responding with different fingers,  ) or distinct (e.g., to choose voluntarily between stopping and acting in the adapted Go/NoGo task,  ). Importantly, participants are made aware that all available options are homogeneous in terms of their objective outcomes, and the tasks do not introduce or manipulate rewards of costs according to the choices made. In other words, the task is not to identify a correct response. Rather participants can choose any of the available options. The alternate options are equally appropriate, and one's decision must come from intention. The intention could be influenced by endogenous factors, including subtly differential effort, preferences ( ), habits ( ), incorrectly inferred arbitrary rules for the task, and recent actions ( ;  ). \n\nIn recent years, there has been a substantial number of brain imaging studies adopting free-choice paradigms, enabling a well-powered meta-analysis. The current study focused on the hemodynamic and metabolic contrasts of intentional choice vs. specified response, which is the most widely reported task-related effect across free-choice studies. Here, specified responses serve as a control condition, in which participants need to make specific responses determined by the experimenter, rather than choose voluntarily from the same set of options in the free-choice condition. Therefore, the contrast between the two conditions offers an imaging marker of brain activation associated with intentional behaviour, controlling for the common effects of stimulus encoding and response initiation. \n\nThe objectives of this study were three-fold. First, to identify brain regions consistently activated by intentional decision, we performed a systematic search of BOLD-fMRI or PET studies of intentional decision and conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Increased BOLD-fMRI and PET responses during intentional choices are commonly reported in a frontoparietal network centred on the medial frontal cortex ( ). However, some studies also observed activations external to this network during intentional behaviour, in particular in the insula ( ;  ;  ) and the inferior frontal gyrus ( ). Because results from a coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis are pooled from a large number of participants in multiple studies, they usually have higher statistical power than a single experimental study ( ). Using ALE analyses, we aim to test whether there are significant clusters of foci associated with intentional decision across a wide range of free-choice paradigms, and whether these clusters extend beyond the commonly reported medial prefrontal cortex. \n\nSecond, we conducted further contrast and conjunction meta-analyses, assessing the differential and common convergence of brain activations reported by studies investigating different types of intentional behaviour. As highlighted above, the nature of options in a free-choice paradigm can vary significantly between studies and hence involve different cognitive processes. We reviewed all studies to date that met our predefined inclusion criteria (see   Study selection and inclusion criteria  ). Based on the experimental design and implementational details of individual studies, we proposed four categories of the free-choice paradigm ( , see   Paradigm-specific meta-analysis   for the definition of each paradigm): reactional intention (RI), perceptual intention (PI), inhibitory intention (II) and cognitive intention (CI). We hypothesize significant clusters of foci associated with each category of free-choice paradigms. Using ALE contrast analysis, we further tested the hypothesis that some brain regions are more likely to be activated in one free-choice paradigm over another.   \nSchematics and examples of four categories of free-choice studies. (  A  ) In the reactive intention (RI) paradigm, task cues directly indicate available actions. For example, in  , the cue for intentional choice was four black dots, indicating that participants can respond with any one of their four fingers. The cue for a specified response was a black dot over a specific finger, indicating that participants should only respond with that finger. (  B  ) In the perceptual intention (PI) paradigm, task cues contain perceptually similar options that associated with different options. For example, in Lau et\u00a0al. (2004), the cue for intentional choice was the cross at the middle of the screen, indicating that participants can choose any of the patterns on the screen. The cue for a specified response was a specific pattern at the centre of the screen, indicating that participants should choose the pattern that matches the cue. (  C)   In the inhibitory intention (II) paradigm, one of the options is to abandon or abort an intended action. Hence, participants make voluntary choices between Go and Stop (e.g.,  ). In the corresponding specified response condition, participants are instructed to either execute or inhibit their actions. (  D  ) In the cognitive intention (CI) paradigm, participants choose between different operations that require higher-level cognitive processing. Behavioural responses are dependent on the execution of the chosen cognitive operation. For example, in  , the cues were different for the intentional and specified condition. In the intentional condition, participants chose to add or subtract two numbers and then select the correct answer based on their choice. In the specified condition, participants followed the instruction to perform a specific arithmetic operation. \n  Fig 1   \n\nThird, to undertake an exploratory data-driven analysis, testing whether consistent BOLD-fMRI/PET patterns of intentional behaviour correspond to specific cognitive processes. We quantified the similarity between the meta-analytical whole-brain activation pattern estimated from free-choice studies and brain activation patterns from 100 specific cognitive topics, extracted from a database of over 11,000 brain imaging studies ( ;  ). This \u201cdecoding\u201d approach raises hypotheses about the putative cognitive processes underpinning intentional behaviour, where different cognitive processes are associated with specific networks of the human brain. Finally, we reviewed results from these meta-analyses in the context of current cognitive models of intentional choice. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study selection and inclusion criteria \n  \nWe defined intentional choices as experimental paradigms involving self-initiated, voluntary selections of an action from two or more alternatives ( ). The experimental procedure would need to instruct participants that there are no correct or incorrect choices, and they are free to choose any option among available alternatives. This type of intentional choices differs from conventional goal-directed or externally cued behaviour, in which a correct or instructed response could be defined or identified. We focused on existing studies investigating the   \u201cwhat\u201d   (which action to choose) or \u201c  whether  \u201d (whether or not to execute an action) component of intentional behaviour ( ). Studies focusing on the \u201c  when  \u201d component (i.e., when to execute, as in  ) is not considered here, but is briefly reviewed in Discussion. \n\nWe conducted a systematic literature search in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines ( ) to identify brain imaging studies of intentional choice. The literature search was performed on both PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC) databases, because the two databases may contain different publications. The PubMed database was searched with specified keywords as following: (\"volitional decision\" OR \"volitional choice\" OR \"voluntary decision\" OR \"intended decision\" OR \"intentional decision\" OR \"voluntary choice\" OR \"intended choice\" OR \"intentional choice\" OR \"free decision\" OR \"free choice\" OR \"volitional action\" OR \"voluntary action\" OR \"intended action\" OR \"intentional action\" OR \"free action\" OR \"volitional selection\" OR \"voluntary selection\" OR \"intended selection\" OR \"intentional selection\" OR \"free selection\") AND (\"fMRI\" OR \"functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" OR \"BOLD\" OR \"Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent\" OR \"Positron Emission Tomography\"). For the PMC database, the same keywords were employed in the interrogation and a filter on the search field was set to \u201cBody - Key Terms\u201d to constrain search in a more concrete range. The search results from PubMed and PMC databases were combined with duplicated records removed, resulting in 332 publications as of October 2020. \n\nWe then inspected every publication from the literature search. The further inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis were applied as follows:   \nStudies reported first hand data that comes from experiments rather than reviews or meta-analysis. 291 of the 332 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies included results from healthy adult participants. 239 of the remaining 291 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies employed an intentional choice paradigm(s) and reported a fMRI/PET contrast of intentional choice vs. specified response conditions. Here, in the specified response condition, participants responded with the same set of possible actions as in the intentional choice condition, but the identity of which action to respond (or whether to respond) was determined by the experimenter. 37 of the remaining 239 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies reported whole-brain analysis with MNI or Talairach coordinates of the cluster peaks. 34 of the remaining 37 publications met this criterion. \n  \nIf more than one appropriate contrast with the same group of subjects were reported in a single study, only one contrast was included in the meta-analysis. \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of intentional decision \n  \nAfter the screening, 34 fMRI/PET studies met the selection criteria, which included 35 independent experiments for meta-analysis. 25 studies recruited only right-handed participants, 1 study recruited thirteen right-handed and one left-handed participants, and the other 8 studies did not specify participants\u2019 handedness. These studies contained a total of 633 participants and reported 329 peak foci of increased fMRI/PET responses to the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast. Less than 3% foci (9 out of 329) were out of the brain mask in the GingerALE toolbox ( ;  ), which was within the normal range due to spatial smoothing and potential registration errors ( ). Therefore, all foci were included in the study to maximize the usage of the original dataset. For activation foci reported in the Talairach space, we converted them to MNI coordinates using the Lancaster algorithm ( ). \n\nThe coordinates-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was conducted over all the 35 experiments using the Ginger-ALE toolbox ( , version 3.0.2) ( ;  ). This analysis aimed to determine, across independent experiments, significant spatial convergence of fMRI/PET activation probabilities for the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast, under the null hypothesis that the activation foci are distributed randomly throughout the brain. First, for each experiment, the activation probabilities of all foci reported were modelled as 3D Gaussian probability distributions with their full-width half-maximum (FWHM) estimated from the between-subject variance of the experiment ( ). Second, an ALE activation map was then calculated by combining all experimental-level activation maps, yielding a voxel-wise ALE score to quantify the convergence of results across experiments at each voxel location. Third, an analytical approach was used to determine the null distribution of voxel-wise ALE scores. A non-parametric   p  -value map of ALE scores was then generated under the null distribution ( ). Finally, the   p  -value map was thresholded at   p\u00a0<  \u00a00.001 and corrected for multiple comparisons across voxels using a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction from 5,000 permutations (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, cluster-corrected). \n\n\n### Paradigm-specific meta-analysis \n  \nWe categorized the 35 experiments into four intentional choice paradigms based on their experimental designs and procedures ( ). The first category is referred to as reactional intention (RI), in which participants voluntarily choose cues that associate to specific motor actions. We considered this category as the simplest form of intentional choice because a cue in the RI paradigm is directly linked to a target action. The second category is referred to as perceptual intention (PI), in which participants voluntarily choose between perceptually distinct targets (e.g., icons or pictures). Compared to the RI paradigm, the PI paradigm involves an additional matching process: an option is associated with a perceptual target, and the target is then associated with a specific motor action. The third category is referred to as inhibitory intention (II), in which at least one option is not to act (i.e., withholding responses). A cue in the II paradigm is associated directly with a specific action or the inhibition of action. The final category is referred to as cognitive intention (CI). The free choice condition in the CI paradigm requires the participants to choose between options that involve higher-order cognitive processes such as doing arithmetic or generating words. \n\nFor studies employed each of the four paradigm categories, we performed the same ALE meta-analysis to identify the spatial convergence of fMRI/PET activation for the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast. The same procedure to correct for multiple comparisons was applied as in the meta-analysis across all studies (see  ). \n\nBased on the thresholded ALE maps from individual paradigms, we then conducted further conjunction and contrast meta-analyses between the RI and PI paradigms as well as the RI and II paradigms, using the \u201ccontrast study\u201d function implemented in GingerALE. This allowed us to localize voxels commonly (i.e., conjunction) or differentially (i.e., contrast) activated across intentional choice paradigms. The conjunction images were created using the voxel-wise minimum value of the input ALE images. To correct for study sizes ( ), the contrast analyses were conducted through permutation tests. First, the ALE differences image was created by directly subtracting one input image from the other. Second, the simulated data was created by pooling the foci datasets and randomly dividing them into two new groups with the same size as the original groups. Third, a new ALE difference image was created by directly subtracting of the two new datasets and then compared to the true data. Fourth, with multiple permutations, a voxel-wise   p-  value image was created to illustrate where the true data sit on the distribution of the ALE differences in each voxel. A lenient threshold (cluster threshold 200 mm , uncorrected voxel-level threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, permutation tests with 5,000 iterations) was applied to the contrast analyses between paradigm categories to avoid type II errors ( ). No conjunction or contrast meta-analysis was conducted on experiments using the CI paradigm due to the limited number of studies available in that category. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic decoding of intentional decision \n  \nALE activation maps indicate brain regions of consistent fMRI/PET activations between studies. We then used NeuroSynth ( ) to perform a \u201creverse-inference\u201d type of meta-analysis. That is, we meta-analytically decoded which cognitive functions or processes are likely to give rise to the consistent brain activations observed in ALE activation maps. As highlighted previously, one should interpret results from reverse inference with caution ( ). Most functional brain imaging results are correlational. The involvement of a brain region in a certain cognitive function does not directly support the notion that the region is exclusively associated with the cognitive process. Nevertheless, meta-analytic decoding against large, unbiased imaging databases did provide useful information about the engagement of cognitive processes ( ). In the current study, we consider our meta-analytic decoding analysis to be contributory rather than confirmatory, which offers insights for future studies of intentional decision. \n\nWe considered a set of 100 cognitive topics that were previously generated from over 11,000 brain imaging studies. The 100 topics were extracted by fitting a generative statistical model of sematic topics ( ) to the abstracts of over 11,000 brain imaging articles in the NeuroSynth database (for details see  ). We ignored the topics related to general methods (e.g., fMRI) and focus only on the topics related to cognitive processes. For each cognitive topic, a whole-brain association-test map (also referred to as the reverse inference map) was generated from all the articles in the database. The value at each voxel of the association-test map quantifies the extent to which studies loaded highly on the current topic reported more consistent activation at this location than all the other studies ( ). \n\nWe estimated the similarity between each unthresholded ALE activation   p-  value map with respect to the association-test maps of the 100 cognitive topics by calculating their Pearson correlations across voxels. The resulting correlation coefficients were rank ordered to identify the cognitive topics that are most likely to be present during intentional decision and its specific paradigms. \n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nAll data used in this meta-analysis study were obtained from original publications. We have made the aggregated data open access ( ), which include the imaging data entered meta-analyses and unthresholded statistical maps from meta-analyses. \n\n\n### Ethics statement \n  \nThis study did not include data from new participants. In all meta-analyses, we only considered studies that had obtained informed consent from human participants. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of intentional decision \n  \nThirty-four brain imaging studies were identified from our symmetric literature search, which included 35 independent experiments of intentional decision. The number of participants, experimental paradigms and other details were summarized in  .   \nList of intentional decision studies that meet the inclusion criteria. \n  Table 1       \n\nThere is no correct answer among available options in free choice paradigms. Nevertheless, behavioural performance can be evaluated in other ways, for example using response time (normally referred to the latency between task cues and responses) and the proportion of valid response. The latter applies to experiments (e.g.,  ) in which participants make a free choice from   M   available options when there is a total of   N   options (where   M  <  N  ). If an unavailable option was chosen, the response is deemed to be invalid. Here, the proportion of valid response is akin to the conventional decision accuracy. Supplementary Table 3 summarized the behavioural responses from studies included in the meta-analysis. The general pattern of the high proportion of valid response and fast RT suggest that participants did actively perform tasks in those studies. \n\nAcross all the 35 experiments, a Ginger-ALE meta-analysis on the contrast between free choice and specified response yielded greater BOLD-fMRI/PET activations related to intentional behaviour in a frontoparietal network ( ). The analysis identified 19 peaks in 7 clusters, including bilateral pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right premotor area and left anterior insula cortex (AIC) ( ,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, cluster-level corrected). At a more lenient threshold (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01 uncorrected), there was a cluster in the right AIC (peak coordinate:   X  \u00a0=\u00a034,   Y  \u00a0=\u00a024,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a08).   \nALE meta-analyses of all free-choice studies showing significant clusters related to intentional decision (  p  <0.01, cluster-level FWE corrected from 5,000 permutations).

Voxels in this cluster mainly intersect with one of the five ROIs in the HCP-MMP atlas ( ): a24pr (ventral ACC), p24 (ventral ACC), d32 (dorsal ACC), 8BM (pre-SMA) and SCEF (supplementary and cingulate eye fields) ( C). The posterior boundary of the medial prefrontal cluster falls in the SCEF (Brodmann area 6). \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of contrasts between intentional decision paradigms \n  \nTo investigate whether different types of intentional behaviour relate to selective brain responses, we assigned intentional decision studies into four categories ( ), depending on their characteristics of experimental paradigms: reactive intention (RI), perceptual intention (PI), inhibitory intention (II) and other higher cognitive intention (CI). \n\nFree choices in the RI paradigm were consistently associated with greater activations in 6 clusters with 13 peak foci, including bilateral pre-SMA and ACC, bilateral IPL, bilateral prefrontal area and right premotor area. For the PI paradigm, the analysis revealed 4 clusters with 8 peak foci located in bilateral prefrontal area, left ACC and pre-SMA cluster. For the II paradigm, there were 7 clusters with 14 peak foci located in bilateral IPL, right premotor area, bilateral prefrontal area and right PreSMA. No significant results were observed in the meta-analysis of the CI paradigm, possibly due to the limited number of studies in that category. \n\nTo quantify the differential and common convergence of brain activation in studies of different types of intentional behaviour, we conducted further contrast and conjunction meta-analyses, comparing both the PI paradigm (involving perceptual processing) and the II paradigm (involving inhibitory processing) with the most elementary paradigm (i.e., the RI paradigm). The contrast meta-analysis showed that the bilateral IPL is more likely to activate in the II than the RI paradigm ( B,  ). No significant difference was found between PI and RI paradigm. The conjunction meta-analysis showed that bilateral Pre-SMA/ACC complex and the left dlPFC are commonly activated in intentional behaviour across studies of PI and RI paradigms, and activations in the right IPL and right PreSMA are commonly observed in both II and RI paradigms ( A,  ).   \nContrast and conjunction meta-analyses (  A  ) ALE conjunction meta-analyses between PI and RI paradigms (top) as well as II and RI paradigms (bottom).

Peak coordinates of clusters were reported in the MNI space (mm). \n  Table 4   \n\n\n### Meta-analytic decoding of intentional decision \n  \nTo probe cognitive processes underlying intentional decision, we assessed the spatial similarity (i.e., Pearson correlation across voxels) between the ALE activation maps from our meta-analysis and 100 association-test maps. Each of the association-test maps represents brain response selective to one of 100 psychological topics, generated from meta-analyses of >11,000 independent studies ( ). Therefore, a high correlation coefficient to an association-test map would imply the potential involvement of the corresponding cognitive process. The primary interest here is the relative ranking of the topics based on the similarity of their association-test maps to our results, not to perform null hypothesis significance testing on each correlation. \n\nThis exploratory analysis showed that the frontoparietal network identified in the meta-analysis of intentional decision across all studies ( ) was strongly associated with several psychological topics. The top three are working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.445), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.392) and cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.366) ( , and see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for full results).   \nMeta-analytic decoding of intentional decision. Correlation coefficients between different cognitive topics\u2019 association maps and ALE maps of intentional decision were calculated. The correlation values for the top 8 topics were illustrated in a polar plot. Terms used to generate those topic-based association maps were listed in Supplementary Table 1. \n  Fig 4   \n\nWe also applied the same decoding procedure to paradigm-specific ALE-activation maps. The RI paradigm was associated with the topic of working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.393), conflict (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.350) and task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.348). PI paradigm was associated with the topic of working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.450), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.325) and cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.322). II paradigm was associated with the working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.307), cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.271), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.260) and feedback (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.227). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur meta-analysis considered the convergence of fMRI/PET responses reported in intentional decision studies. Across a large variety of free-choice paradigms, when contrasted against the same behavioural response prescribed exogenously ( ), intentional decision is associated with a convergence of BOLD/PET activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA and caudal ACC), the lateral frontoparietal cortices (DLPFC and IPL) and the anterior insula cortex (AIC). Here, we specifically focused on the free-choice paradigm, in which participants were given the freedom to choose among multiple options, instead of seeking a correct answer as in perceptual or reward based decision-making tasks. Our study further delineates a broad spectrum of free-choice paradigms in the current literature, with category-specific ALE results. \n\nPrevious meta-analysis studies on similar topics have distinct research questions. For example,   examined the overlapping activity between action selection and action inhibition, with the latter referring to the externally-instructed go/no-go task, different from intentional inhibition paradigms considered here. Using clustering analysis,   reported regions separately associated with the   what, when   and   whether   components of intentional action. Our specific focus on free choice paradigms resulted in more studies from the literature search than previous meta-analyses: 35 experiments vs. 17 studies on intentional decision in   and 15 studies in  . With the increased power, the current study confirmed that the cortical activation pattern reported here is generalizable across a rich set of free-choice paradigms. It further confirmed the involvement of the AIC that was not consistently observed in previous studies. \n\nThe meta-analytic decoding analysis suggested that the spatial convergence of fMRI/PET responses in intentional decision is similar to previous experiments investigating certain cognitive terms, e.g., cognitive control, working memory and conflict. This is an exploratory analysis, and the decoding results were not tested against a null hypothesis to confirm the involvement of a particular cognitive function. Rather than interpreting cognitive functions of a single brain region, the meta-analytic decoding analysis quantitatively related whole-brain ALE results of intentional decision to previous imaging results. The overlapping brain maps between intentional decision and other cognitive paradigms, as suggested by our exploratory analyses, may lead to the development of new hypotheses and predictions. For example, one may test the interplay between intentional choices and working memory, with the expectation that lesion or brain stimulation to a region associated with both processes would affect behaviour. Therefore, our results provide insight into the cognitive roles of brain networks that mediate intentional behaviour in humans, which we discuss below together with their potential computational processes. \n\n### Functional localization of intentional decision in the brain \n  \nThe brain areas involved in intentional decision overlap closely with the multiple demand network ( ;  ), a \u201ctask-positive\u201d co-activation pattern associated with diverse cognitive demands ( ;  ). A closer inspection of the literature indicates that subcomponents of this network may serve different cognitive roles during intentional decisions, which is also supported by our meta-analytic decoding results ( ). \n\nA large body of evidence indicates the putative role of ACC in conflict monitoring ( ). Conflicts in information processing arise from the presence of response competition. Greater ACC activation is consistently observed when (1) one or more prepotent responses need to be overridden, such as in the Stroop task ( ;  ) and the flanker task ( ;  ), or (2) a voluntary choice is needed among multiple underdetermined options, like in all the free-choice paradigms discussed here. Although the existing literature of conflict monitoring is largely focused on the ACC, the adjacent pre-SMA is also sensitive to the presence of conflict, in particular the conflict in response selection, as lesions in this region lead to deficits in exerting voluntary control over immediate actions ( ). According to the conflict monitoring theory, as multiple options become available in the free-choice paradigm, increased ACC and pre-SMA activities may encode conflicts as an index of the need for greater cognitive demand, which in turn trigger voluntary choices to reduce or resolve the conflict ( ;  ). A direct prediction of this proposition is that the activity in the medial prefrontal cortex should increase proportionally, at least to some extent, to the number of available options in the free-choice paradigm, which has been validated in previous studies (e.g.,  ). \n\nACC, more specifically the dorsal ACC, is also involved in a diverse set of cognitive functions beyond conflict monitoring, including error detection and response selection ( ;  ). Using a modified flanker task with free choices,   showed a disassociation between ACC and pre-SMA in conflict monitoring and response selection, respectively. However, there is a lack of studies to attribute a definitive functional role to the dorsal ACC across multiple free-choice paradigms. \n\nBeyond the medial prefrontal cortex, the frontoparietal network on the lateral brain surface has a distinct functional connectivity pattern relating to cognitive control ( ) and executive task performance ( ). Two functions of this network are essential to intentional behaviour. First, intentional decisions in the free-choice paradigm are, by definition, rendered endogenously. Nevertheless, the brain may still establish a \u201ctask set\u201d that incorporates transient and arbitrary rules in addition to relevant exogenous information, such as associations of stimuli and imagined outcomes as well as available options ( ). Both single-unit recording in non-human primates ( ;  ;  ) and brain imaging in humans ( ;  ) have identified neural representations of various task sets in the frontoparietal network. The encoding of a task set can be actively maintained in this network until its execution ( ), thereby facilitating the intentional decision process to unfold in time. Second, intentional behaviour is commonly accompanied by the subjective experience of volitional control ( ), which requires internal models that matches the consequences of the response against its initial intention ( ). It has been proposed that the parietal cortex hosts such internal models ( ), as patients with parietal lesions exhibited altered behavioural and electrophysiological signatures of their intention to act ( ). \n\nOur meta-analysis across all free-choice experiments showed the consistent involvement of the AIC during intentional decision, in spite of the lack of significant insula activity in some studies (e.g.,  ). This supports an earlier account that the AIC is a key component of the integrated brain network involved in intentional behaviour ( ). Anatomically, the AIC connects directly to the ACC ( ;  ). Functionally, robust coactivation in the AIC and ACC was observed across multiple cognitive domains ( ) as well as in resting-state ( ), and both regions are a part of the salience network ( ). It may therefore be tempting to ascribe the AIC activity to conflict processing during intentional decision, similar to that of ACC. An alternative proposal originated from the AIC's unique function in signalling introspective awareness ( ) or subjective salience ( ) of cognitive ( ), homeostatic ( ;  ) and emotional ( ) information, which is not shared with the ACC. According to this theory, AIC activity reflects the affective consequences of intentional decisions. In other words, the AIC may not directly associate with the formation of current intention; instead, it evaluates the outcome of the intentional act with respect to an internal model of one's long term goal (see   for a detailed review). \n\n\n### The which, when and whether components of intentional behaviour \n  \nThe current study does not aim to support or challenge the conceptual Which-When-Weather (WWW) distinctions ( ). Instead, we focused on a common contrast in free-choice paradigms (i.e., choice vs. specified), which emphasizes the presence of an intentional choice among alternatives. Our literature review suggested that papers reporting this contrast examined the BOLD/PET response to decisions between actions (reactive intention), between perceptual targets (perceptual intention), between act and stop (inhibitory intention) and between more complex cognitive operations (cognitive intention). Main research questions in these paradigms naturally involve the   which   and   whether   components of the WWW model. \n\nThe timing of intentional behaviour, the   when   component of the WWW model, is initially and commonly investigated using electrophysiology ( ), focusing on the time course of neural activity leading to an intentional act. This does not preclude the use of fMRI/PET to study the contrast of responses at intentional timing vs. responses at specified timing. \n\nImaging studies on the   when   component employed diverse designs and their primary contrasts includes: (1) subjective awareness of the timing of intention as in Libet's task ( ) vs. subjective awareness of the timing of an action ( ); (2) free to act at any time vs. act after a response cue ( ); (3) free to act at one of several time points vs. act at a specified time point ( ;  ). As such, existing studies considering the   when   component cannot be readily formalized as a choice between one overt option versus another, different from other free-choice paradigms considered here. Also, previous meta-analysis has specifically summarized studies of the   when   component ( ). Hence, we did not include those papers in the current meta-analysis. We outlined below how the   when   component can be incorporated into a computational model of intentional decision. \n\n\n### Computational processes of intentional decision \n  \nWith the identification of the consistent brain network for intentional decision-making, a new question arises: what is the computational process underlying intentional decision? Converging findings from behavioural modelling ( ), single-unit recoding ( ;  ;  ) and imaging ( ;  ;  ) experiments suggest that, when making choices based on external stimuli, an accumulation-to-threshold mechanism governs the decision-making process ( ;  ;  ): the evidence supporting one or multiple options are accumulated over time, and a choice is made when the accumulated evidence reached a decision threshold. For perceptual decisions with noisy sensory stimuli, this accumulation process reduces the momentary noise in information-processing and in turn results in more accurate decisions ( ,  ;  ). \n\nFor intentional decisions, it has been shown that a computational model implementing the accumulation-to-threshold mechanism can well describe the behavioural performance (i.e., response time distributions and choice probabilities) of both RI ( ) and PI paradigms ( ). Furthermore, the accumulated evidence predicted by the model is associated with the BOLD response in the ACC and pre-SMA on a trial-by-trial basis ( ). These results raise an intriguing possibility that, during intentional decision, the medial prefrontal cortex implements the accumulation-to-threshold process to integrate over time the transitory intention of choosing different options, until the accumulated intention for one choice reaches a decision threshold. \n\nThis hypothesis is supported by several electrophysiological studies, which characterised the accumulation process during intentional behaviour at a high temporal resolution. First, in Libet's paradigm of voluntary action, the readiness potential measured by scalp EEG precedes participants\u2019 conscious awareness of their voluntary intention (i.e., the \u201curge to move\u201d,  ). An accumulator model can be fit to the time latency of participants\u2019 urge to move, and the activity of the accumulator qualitatively reproduces the time course of the readiness potential prior to conscious intention ( ). Second, in a free-choice version of Libet's paradigm, when participants made intentional decisions between responding with their left or right hands, neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex build up several hundred milliseconds before the onset of conscious intention ( ). Further, medial prefrontal neurons contralateral to the acting hand exhibited larger activity than ipsilateral neurons ( ). Therefore, the medial prefrontal cortex may host accumulated intentions of multiple responses as well as their mutual competition, from which voluntary acts are rendered via the accumulation-to-threshold mechanism. \n\nThe putative role of the medial prefrontal cortex in intention accumulation is not inconsistent with this region's function of conflict monitoring discussed above, because more free options would be associated with larger accumulated intention across alternatives as well as higher conflict. In this regard, intention accumulation can be interpreted as a computational implementation of detecting and resolving conflicts among underdetermined options. Therefore, we consider the accumulation process as a parsimonious computational framework for intentional behaviour outlined by the conceptual   what  -  when  -  whether   model ( ), because accumulator models can explain quantitatively both \u201c  what\u201d   (i.e., choice probabilities) and   \u201cwhen\u201d   (i.e., response time distributions) components. Interestingly, accumulator models can also be fitted to behavioural performance in externally-triggered stopping tasks ( ;  ). Future research should investigate if accumulator models can incorporate the \u201c  whether  \u201d component, or voluntary stopping in the II paradigm. \n\n\n### Paradigm-specific activations during intentional decision \n  \nBy categorizing free-choice studies into different types according to their experimental design, we identified brain regions associated with consistent and specific convergence between studies on sub-categories of intentional decision ( ). The conjunction meta-analysis of the RI and PI paradigms showed that the pre-SMA/ACC and DLPFC are associated with both types of intentional decision. This is expected, as the RI and PI paradigms have a similar task structure, involving rapid voluntary choices among multiple action plans ( ). However, the contrast analysis did not reveal any difference between the two paradigms. \n\nThe II paradigm includes a unique option of not to act or intentionally inhibit one's action ( C). The conjunction meta-analysis of the II and RI paradigms showed that the right supramarginal gyrus in the IPL and right pre-SMA was associated with both types of intentional decisions, and the contrast meta-analysis showed that the bilateral supramarginal gyrus was more likely to be activated in the II than that in the RI paradigm. In both RI and II paradigms, participants need to reprogram their response model according to available options in each trial, which fits the critical role of the supramarginal gyrus in action reprogramming ( ). The same region is also sensitive to the content of action plans and their similarity ( ). It could be argued that options in the II paradigm are more dissimilar (i.e., acting versus stopping) than that in the RI paradigm (i.e., multiple but similar actions), which leads to the additional recruitment of the supramarginal gyrus in the II paradigm. \n\nIt is worth noting that the results of conjunction and contrast meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution, because of the limited number of studies available in each category. Our discussion on the functional roles involved in individual paradigms was based on previous evidence and hence was circumstantial. Furthermore, one potential confound of the contrast meta-analysis is that different paradigm categories may vary in their task difficulty, and hence the contrast between categories may not directly support the involvement of distinct cognitive processes. This issue can be examined in future studies that explicitly manipulate both task difficulty and intentional decision paradigms. \n\n\n### Future directions and conclusion \n  \nThis analysis leaves open some issues for future research on human intentional decision-making. First, our systematic review identified only five studies in the CI category: three studies included options with attention shifts or saccades ( ;  ;  ), one with verbal responses ( ) and the other one with arithmetic rules ( ). The small number of CI studies did not yield any significant result in the paradigm-specific meta-analysis, but that may reflect type II error. We recommend future research to explore different types of CI studies and examine the robustness and consistency of existing results across a range of distinct cognitive processes. \n\nSecond, our meta-analysis of the II paradigm did not show conventional regions involved in inhibitory control ( ). We propose that this is due to the fact that our analysis used the contrast of intentional choice vs. specified response, with the former including intentional stopping and the latter including externally triggered stopping - this contrast may therefore not detect differential response inhibition. Indeed, the BOLD response in the AIC was higher during intentional stopping than intentional action execution ( ), while the inferior frontal gyrus is consistently observed during instructed stopping ( ). To examine how the brain switches effectively between intentional and instructed stopping in the II paradigm, one need to examine the effective connectivity between these two regions and the medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in both types of stopping ( ;  ). \n\nThird, the current imaging literature on intentional behaviour indicates that the main focus is to localize associated brain regions or their underlying computational processes. Less is known about why a participant would intentionally choose one option over others in a trial. The answer to this question is important because the sequence of intentional decisions over trials are not completely random ( ) but dependent on executive control of working memory ( ), the context of a given choice in a sequence ( ), and other sources of response biases ( ). We suggest that the free-choice paradigm provides an ideal testbed for future research to investigate the interplay between the intentional process during a single trial and modulatory effects that operate at a longer time span. \n\nFourth, brain regions unlikely act in isolation during intentional decision, and the functional connectivity between regions cannot be ignored. Among all studies included in the current meta-analysis, only two examined functional connectivity ( ;  ), insufficient to draw inferences on a meta-analytic level. Using structural equation modelling,   showed that the prefrontal cortex has greater coupling with the motor cortex during free choices of actions, and with the visual cortex during free choices of colours. Similarly, using psychophysiological interaction analyses,   reported greater connectivity between the parietal cortex and the visual cortex during free choice of coloured targets. These results imply task-dependent changes in the effective connectivity between brain regions during free choices. \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis identifies a brain network consistently activated when humans have the freedom to make intentional choices among multiple options. Some components of this network are recruited specifically in subcategories of the free-choice paradigm. Multiple cognitive and computational processes are involved in intentional decision, which collectively serve essential roles in shaping and maintaining volitional control. \n\n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Ruoguang Si:   Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

In view of the proposed trans\u2010synaptic spread of the \u03b1\u2010synuclein pathology, investigating the disease only in this segregated fashion would be detrimental to our understanding of its progression. In this systematic review, we summarize findings on structural and functional brain connectivity in DLB, as connectivity measures may offer better insights on how the brain is affected by the spread of the pathology. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single\u2010positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease\u2010related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed. This knowledge may help improve the diagnosis and prognosis in DLB as well as pinpoint targets for future disease\u2010modifying treatments. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.   Movement Disorders   published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. \n  \nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by widespread connectivity disruptions compared to healthy elderly controls. Across the reviewed structural and functional neuroimaging modalities disruptions emerge most consistently in frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks. Impairments in brain connectivity measures were associated with clinical features of DLB patients.   \n \n\n# Body\n \nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common reason for a dementia diagnosis in old age, being the primary diagnosis of approximately 5% of patients with dementia.  Clinically, patients with DLB present with visual hallucinations (VHs), cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism, and rapid eye movement sleep disorders.  Neuropathologically, the hallmarks of DLB are the eponymous Lewy bodies, which consist of abnormal aggregates of \u03b1\u2010synuclein. In the absence of an available biomarker to assess the \u03b1\u2010synuclein pathology directly, the most recent guidelines recommend a set of neuroimaging biomarkers to aid diagnosis.  These biomarkers include preservation of medial temporal lobe structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), presence of the so\u2010called cingulate island sign on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans, reduced uptake of the dopamine transporter in single\u2010photon emission tomography (SPECT) or PET, and high relative powers in pre\u2010alpha/theta frequency bands in electroencephalography (EEG). Although these indirect manifestations of DLB can improve diagnosis, their restriction to specific brain areas neglects an important aspect of \u03b1\u2010synuclein pathology\u2014its spread during disease progression. Starting from the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the olfactory bulb at the early stages of DLB, an increasing number of cortical and subcortical regions accumulates Lewy bodies at later stages of the disease. ,  ,   Animal research demonstrated that Lewy bodies propagate via axonal transport and transsynaptic pathways to areas connected to the initial site, where misfolded protein aggregates induce the same structural alterations in previously normal \u03b1\u2010synuclein in a prion\u2010like manner. \n\nNeural connections ensure global communication and functional integration of information between brain regions. However, they also provide the scaffold for the transneuronal spread of \u03b1\u2010synuclein aggregates. Thus, investigating neural connectivity and brain network features in DLB may improve our understanding of the disease. These features may not only facilitate tracking of the disease progress but also may help pinpoint potentially \u201cmoving\u201d treatment targets adjusted for the stage of the disease. \n\nMoreover, disruptions of the brain connectome, rather than atrophy or hypometabolism of a specific region, may produce the observed behavioral impairments in DLB. \n\nThis systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of connectivity studies in DLB, spanning a variety of in vivo neuroimaging methods. We cover the integrity and disruption of specific connections as well as evaluate the impact of DLB on the global network efficiency. Furthermore, we outline the relationship between connectivity measures and the clinical phenotype of DLB. Finally, we discuss the potential of connectivity measures to inform clinical procedures in DLB. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data Source \n  \nFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines,  we conducted a systematic search in the Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS databases on studies published prior to November 1, 2021. The following search terms (S1 in Appendix  ) were applied to the title and abstract: (\u201cdementia with Lewy bodies\u201d OR \u201cLewy body dementia\u201d) AND (\u201cconnecti*\u201d OR \u201cnetwork\u201d OR \u201cgraph*\u201d). No restriction was applied on neuroimaging methods to capture the entire spectrum of connectivity measures. The reference lists of all included articles as well as relevant reviews were manually searched to identify additional studies. \n\n\n### Selection Criteria \n  \nFirst, we screened abstracts and selected original articles written in English (Fig.\u00a0 ). Subsequently, full\u2010text articles were assessed for eligibility and included if they reported (1) in vivo (2) neural connectivity measures (3) at rest in (4) patients with DLB (5) compared with elderly healthy controls (HCs). Studies conducted in animals as well as case reports were excluded. Publications from the same research group were closely examined for overlapping data sets\u00a0(S2 in Appendix  ). \n  \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart of study selection. DLB, dementia with Lewy bodies; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; EEG, electroencephalography; FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; GMN, gray matter network; HC, healthy control; PET, positron emission tomography; SPECT; single\u2010positron emission computer tomography. \n  \nThe selection process was primarily conducted by a single researcher (A.H.) and spot checked by a second researcher (D.F.). Uncertainties regarding the inclusion of articles were resolved in discussions among the two researchers. \n\n\n### Assessment of Bias and Quality \n  \nThe quality of all included studies was assessed using the 10\u2010item checklist for case\u2010control studies developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Collaboration.  Therein, scores of 9 to 10 were considered high, 7 to 8 moderate, and \u22646 low quality. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study Characteristics \n  \nIn our search, we identified a total of 1215 records, of which 53 fit our inclusion criteria (Fig.\u00a0 ). Thereof, 16 studies based their connectivity analyses on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), eight studies on FDG\u2010PET, 17 studies on functional MRI, eight studies on EEG, and one study each on gray matter networks (GMNs) and SPECT. Of note, earlier connectivity studies mainly relied on DTI and EEG, while the use of other imaging modalities was established more recently (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n  \nPublished connectivity studies in dementia with Lewy bodies by year and imaging modality. DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; EEG, electroencephalography; FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; GMN, gray matter network; PET, positron emission tomography; SPECT, single\u2010positron emission computer tomography. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nAccording to JBI criteria, 73.6% of the included studies were of moderate and high quality and 26.4% were of low quality (S3 in Appendix  ). Points were most frequently deducted for insufficient matching of DLB and HC groups, incomplete identification of confounders, and incomplete descriptions of imaging methods. \n\nBecause these points concern reporting standards and all studies complied with the methodological standards of the respective imaging field, all results can be considered reliable. \n\nCohort characteristics are summarized in Table\u00a0 . Across studies, cohorts occasionally (partially) overlapped (S2 in Appendix  ). Results of all studies were included in the qualitative overview. If the same cohort was evaluated with similar methods, this overlap is indicated in the text. All studies except four ,  ,  ,   specified that patients were diagnosed according to standardized clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB ,  ,   or prodromal DLB. \n  \nSample characteristics \n    \n\n### Diffusion Tensor Imaging \n  \nAmong all modalities covered by this review, DTI provides the most straightforward assessment of structural neural connections. DTI measures the displacement of water molecules as restricted by tissue boundaries.  Tissue disruptions are indicated by increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy. DTI allows the assessment of global, regional, and tract\u2010specific features, which is reflected by the organization of the following section. \n\nIn DLB, DTI studies have indicated widespread disruptions of white matter (WM) tracts; their exact location, however, varies between reports possibly because of the variable choices and definitions of regions of interest (ROIs) (S4 in Appendix  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). In the absence of WM volume reductions in patients with DLB compared with HCs, Bozzali and colleagues found WM disruptions in areas with long connecting fibers.  Prominent disruptions occurred in the frontal, parietal, occipital, callosal, and pericallosal areas. In another study, WM disruptions in patients with DLB emerged in frontal, temporal, insular, cingular, and visual association areas.  In contrast, in two studies, WM disruptions were largely confined to the parietal and occipital regions with a relative sparing of the frontal regions. ,   In the only study to date to investigate longitudinal changes in WM structure in DLB, Firbank and colleagues  followed up on the participants of the study by Watson and colleagues.  After 1\u2009year, no additional WM changes emerged in patients with DLB, prompting the authors to suggest that disruptions of WM tracts may be an early marker in DLB, which undergoes only minor progression over time. \n  \nBrain regions showing significant differences in connectivity in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with healthy controls in (  A  ) diffusion tensor imaging, (  B  ) gray matter networks, (  C  ) functional magnetic resonance imaging, (  D  ) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and (  E  ) single\u2010positron emission computer tomography. Note that the color intensity should be interpreted in relation to the number of studies per imaging modality. Findings from electroencephalography studies were not included in this figure because of the low spatial resolution of this technique. For white matter tracts in diffusion tensor imaging, differences were mapped for the start and end points of the respective tracts. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nIn a cross\u2010sectional study by Firbank and colleagues,  patients with DLB displayed WM disruptions exclusively in the precuneus. In contrast, Kantarci and colleagues did not find any differences in WM tracts in the precuneus of patients with DLB when compared with HCs.  Instead, only the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) of patients with DLB exhibited WM disruptions. \n\nWith the featured disruption in the ILF, the study conducted by Kantarci and colleagues lines up with eight other studies that provided insights into disruptions occurring in specific WM tracts in DLB. Although some of these studies selected a priori visual association fibers  or fibers in the language network,  in other studies, the importance of these tracts arose from a whole\u2010brain approach.  Across studies, WM disruptions manifested most consistently in the ILF ,  ,  ,  ,   as well as in the uncinate fasciculus ,  ,  ,  ,   (but compare to Firbank and colleagues ). The superior longitudinal fasciculus ,  ,   and the inferior fronto\u2010occipital fasciculus ,  ,   have also been repeatedly shown to be disrupted in patients with DLB. \n\nIn addition, the cingulum was disrupted in patients with DLB compared with HCs. ,  ,   In contrast, Schumacher and colleagues did not find WM disruptions in the cingulum.  Beyond the disruptions seen in association fibers, disruptions manifested also in the corpus callosum of patients with DLB. ,  \n\nFollowing up on previous evidence of cholinergic deficits and volume reductions in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in DLB, Schumacher and colleagues performed tractography on NBM pathways.  Patients with DLB presented with WM disruptions in the lateral and medial NBM pathways. However, the observed disruption in the medial NBM pathway lost significance when controlling for mean diffusivity in whole\u2010brain WM and may thus not represent a tract\u2010specific feature but instead a more global disruption of WM in DLB. \n\n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nIn the context of fMRI, connections between brain regions are established based on their covariation in the blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signal over time. For resting\u2010state functional connectivity, BOLD activity is not prompted by a specific task but reflects spontaneous fluctuations, which are thought to reflect neural baseline activity. In accordance with the disruptions observed in structural networks in patients with DLB, functional networks also experience local and global disruptions (S6 in Appendix  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nWith regard to local connectivity, Borroni and colleagues showed a reduction in local coherence in posterior brain regions.  A study by Schumacher and colleagues, on the other hand, reported reductions in within\u2010network connectivity restricted to the motor, temporal, and frontal areas.  These divergent findings may be attributable to the assessment of slightly different spatial scales. A predominance of local disruption in the posterior and temporal regions of patients with DLB received support by an fMRI study that conducted graph\u2010theoretical analyses that revealed a decrease in nodal degree and betweenness centrality in the parietal and temporal cortices.  Apart from local disruptions, this study also demonstrated that desynchronization between brain regions predominantly affected middle\u2010 and long\u2010range connections across the entire brain in DLB. \n\nApart from these more explorative approaches, most fMRI\u2010based connectivity articles focused on specific resting\u2010state networks. Several studies found a reduction of functional connectivity within the frontoparietal network (FPN) ,   as well as between the FPN and default mode network (DMN)  and dorsal attention network (DAN ). In contrast, Chabran and colleagues showed an increase in connectivity between a left temporal FPN ROI and a left visuoperceptual ROI, whereas the correlation between visuoperceptual ROIs was decreased.  In combination with a study by Sourty and colleagues,  these findings point to a hemispheric asymmetry of functional connectivity differences in patients with DLB compared with HCs. \n\nRegarding the DMN of patients with DLB, many studies revealed a decrease in within\u2010network connectivity as well as disrupted connections between DMN regions and other brain regions. In a study by Galvin and colleagues, the bilateral precuneus of patients with DLB exhibited increased connectivity to the putamen and parietal regions and decreased connectivity to the frontal and visual areas as well as the hippocampus.  Indeed, disruptions involving DMN regions (especially the frontal and parietal areas) of patients with DLB are a recurring finding. ,  ,  ,   However, other studies observed aberrant connectivity of DMN regions in the opposite direction, possibly because of different spatial assumptions underlying the analytic procedures. ,  ,   Two of these studies, which were conducted in the same cohort, revealed elevated connectivity from the posterior cingulate cortex to the anterior cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, and anterior and posterior lobes as well as increased connections from DMN subregions to subcortical areas. ,   Furthermore, Chabran and colleagues demonstrated an increased coupling of the DMN with both the salience network and FPN, which they interpreted as a compensatory process to counteract disruptions within and between attention networks.  However, other studies did not find any alterations in the DMN in DLB compared with HCs. ,  ,   Despite the absence of functional connectivity differences involving the posterior DMN, Schumacher and colleagues proposed that fMRI\u2010based functional connectivity is an adequate measure to assess pathology spread across the neural network in DLB.  Specifically, they showed that a higher functional connectivity was accompanied by a higher covariance of tau uptake in PET and, further, that functional connectivity to tau hot and cold spots predicted high and low tau accumulation, respectively, in the connected region. Functional connectivity findings also closely align to the neural structure as evidenced by a single study that constructed GMNs based on correlations of cortical thickness in DLB (S5 in Appendix  ; Fig.\u00a0 ), showing disruptions primarily in the DMN regions. \n\nFunctional as opposed to structural MRI\u2010based connectivity may be closely aligned with the characteristic cognitive fluctuations observed in DLB. Yet, it can be argued that the static correlations assessed by most of the studies neglect the variability of functional connectivity measures over time, which may be of particular interest to fully appreciate the transient nature of symptoms in DLB. \n\nDynamic functional connectivity analyses ,   allow the evaluation of connectivity changes over time. So far, three studies have used dynamic functional connectivity analyses in DLB ,  ,   to show that patients with DLB spend more time in states with overall sparser  and less\u2010positive correlations.  However, these prolonged dwelling times in more segregated states may only emerge at later disease stages because Schumacher and colleagues did not find analogous results in prodromal DLB cases. \n\n\n### Positron Emission Tomography \n  \nFDG\u2010PET can be used to characterize the regional glucose consumption as a marker of neuronal activity. Networks of metabolic connectivity between distinct brain regions can be constructed based on the covarying PET signal between brain areas (S7 in Appendix  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nCoinciding with the findings of structural disconnections in DLB, four studies using graph\u2010theoretical analyses on FDG\u2010PET revealed substantial connectivity differences and a disorganization of the network structure in patients with DLB compared with HCs. ,  ,  ,   Caminiti and colleagues  found a lower clustering coefficient and modularity in patients, indicating a less segregated network in DLB compared with HCs. Concurrently, a greater global efficiency and shorter characteristic path length in patients suggested a higher integration in the DLB group. Taken together, these results indicate a disorganization and dedifferentiation in the network structure of patients with DLB. In addition, Chen and colleagues reported a loss of small\u2010worldness features in the neural networks of patients with DLB, as reflected by a decreased clustering coefficient and an increased characteristic path length.  Furthermore, global and local efficiency were decreased in their patients with DLB. The study also uncovered a distinct rightward asymmetry of local and global efficiency in the DLB group, suggesting a less effective communication within the left hemisphere. Similarly, Imai and colleagues found a decrease in global connectivity in patients with DLB compared with HCs.  The most remarkable differences emerged in the right posterior cingulate and the transverse temporal gyrus. Considering their involvement in the DMN, this finding once more corroborates the importance of the DMN in DLB. \n\nIn this vein, two studies investigated the FDG\u2010PET\u2013based connectivity within and between several resting\u2010state brain networks defined by fMRI. ,   In the study by Sala and colleagues, within\u2010network disruptions predominantly emerged in the primary visual network (VN), limbic network, and posterior DMN.  In addition, between\u2010network disruptions converged on the primary VN and DAN. \n\nAlongside the interest in functionally defined resting\u2010state networks, two studies from the same research group demonstrated severe impairments in FDG\u2010PET networks defined by their predominant neurotransmitters. ,   The cholinergic networks, with the exception of the cholinergic\u00a0Ch1\u2010Ch2 division networks, were severely disrupted in DLB.  The importance of the cholinergic system was also underlined by the only SPECT\u2010based connectivity study so far  that identified a pattern of cholinergic M /M  receptor expression that differentiated patients with DLB from HCs (S8 in Appendix  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nMoreover, the noradrenergic network was shown to undergo a complete reconfiguration in DLB.  Likewise, the two FDG\u2010PET ,   studies demonstrated that DLB is associated with extended metabolic connectivity alterations in the nigro\u2010striato\u2010cortical dopaminergic network. This led the authors to argue that DLB, and synucleinopathies in general, can be regarded as multisystem disorders. Huber and colleagues zoomed in even closer into the association between dopaminergic system and FDG\u2010PET\u2013based connectivity.  Stratified by dopamine degeneration, the FDG\u2010PET connectivity differed across stages of nigrostriatal degeneration: in patients with mild dopamine deficiency, connectivity was higher in the basal ganglia and the limbic system, whereas connectivity was lower in patients with more pronounced dopamine deficiency. \n\n\n### Electroencephalography \n  \nIn the field of EEG, connectivity builds on correlations between the time series of neural oscillations. Compared with the other methods in this review, connectivity in EEG exhibits a lower spatial resolution. On the other hand, EEG provides a higher temporal resolution and allows tapping into different frequency domains of neural oscillations (S9 in Appendix  ). \n\nAcross the different methods that investigated EEG connectivity in DLB, studies reported consistent disruptions in the alpha band in patients with DLB compared with HCs. ,  ,  ,   In addition, studies also found congruent results of a reduced connectivity in the alpha frequency range at the prodromal DLB stage.  Approaching disturbances in the alpha band from a network point of view, three studies conducted graph\u2010theoretical analyses. ,  ,   Van Dellen and colleagues reported network disruptions in the alpha band in patients with DLB , a finding that was endorsed by two subsequent studies that explored different EEG connectivity measures in the same cohort. ,   Interestingly, Mehraram and colleagues further demonstrated that long\u2010distance, frontoparietal connections were affected in particular.  Taking it a step further, Dauwan and colleagues explored directed connectivity in DLB.  In contrast to HCs, in whom occipital regions drove activity in the frontal areas in the alpha band, this posterior\u2013anterior gradient was significantly disturbed in patients with DLB. This result mirrors the decreased causal connectivity between the frontal and parietal areas of patients with DLB described in the previous fMRI section. \n\nAlthough most of the studies summarized in this section conducted their analyses in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, significant differences were mostly limited to the alpha band. That said, disruptions arising in the beta band network typically aligned to those obtained for alpha frequencies, thus emphasizing their common association with attentional processes.  In a study by Kai and colleagues, intrahemispheric and to a lesser degree interhemispheric connectivity were reduced in the beta band in patients who did not take donepezil.  Patients who had undergone donepezil treatment, however, only exhibited a reduction in intrahemispheric connectivity in the beta band between two temporal EEG electrodes (T3\u2013T5). This discrepancy according to medication intake was contradicted by a subsequent study that used a different connectivity measure.  Although the majority of patients with DLB were on cholinesterase inhibitors, beta band connectivity was decreased across all distance ranges. \n\nAt theta frequencies, Kai and colleagues revealed a widespread decrease in intrahemispheric connectivity. On the other hand, differences in interhemispheric connectivity were more focalized with only a single pair of temporal electrodes (T3\u2013T4) and a pair of frontal electrodes (F3\u2013F4) showing decreased and increased interhemispheric connectivity, respectively.  Two more studies also evidenced an increased network segregation in the theta band. ,   Only two early studies reported significant connectivity differences in the delta band. Whereas Kai and colleagues found decreased intra\u2010 and interhemispheric connectivity across multiple electrode pairs,  Andersson and colleagues reported an overall increase in delta band connectivity in patients with DLB. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Congruent Patterns of (Dis\u2010)Connectivity Across Modalities \n  \nThis systematic review shows that the neural networks of patients with DLB were predominantly characterized by disruptions in comparison with HCs, as revealed by all the neuroimaging measures covered in this review. Graph\u2010theoretical analyses on structural and functional MRI, PET, and EEG data evidenced that the brain's global topology, and with this the efficient information transfer, is compromised in DLB. Long\u2010distance connections, especially cholinergic connections, ,   seem to be particularly affected by disruptions. We found that WM disruptions in DLB are severe and extend to more brain regions than in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia.  In contrast, the network disruptions are less diffuse compared with those in patients with Alzheimer's disease.  Across techniques, the more severely affected brain regions in DLB converged on the FPN, DMN, and VNs (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n  \nCombined connectivity differences in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with healthy controls across diffusion tensor imaging, gray matter networks, functional magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and single\u2010positron emission computer tomography. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nNeural networks are small\u2010world networks laid out to balance an efficient transfer and integration of information with the costs to maintain the network.  Any large deviation from this small\u2010worldness in either direction indicates a disequilibrium. Therefore, the ostensibly higher network efficiency and connectivity of patients with DLB identified by some studies ,  ,  ,   may indicate a sparing of short\u2010range relative to long\u2010range connections. Furthermore, this finding may indicate an initial compensatory process that may eventually overburden the neural system.  Because the stability of graph\u2010theoretical measures depends on the sample size,  these findings should be interpreted with caution. Yet, despite some heterogeneous results within any single imaging modality, complementing results across distinct methods reinforce their validity in improving our understanding of DLB. \n\n\n### Connectivity Measures and Clinical Phenotype \n  \nThe convergence of abnormal connectivity detected in the FPN, DMN, and VNs across imaging techniques speaks for the validity of these findings. The importance of the three networks is further corroborated when taking into account their involvement in cognitive functions typically affected in DLB, that is, attention, visuospatial abilities, and executive functions.  For example, disconnections in the FPN have been associated with cognitive fluctuations,  a core clinical feature of DLB. The VN and DMN have been implicated in VHs, another core clinical feature of DLB.  In addition, disruptions in the DMN and VNs, as observed in fMRI and PET, overlap with the loss of connectivity in the alpha network in EEG, which similarly denote impairments in visual attention. \n\nAlthough our review process was not tailored to capture studies investigating associations between neural connectivity and clinical phenotype, a subset of the reviewed studies probed these associations, mainly focusing on VHs, cognition, and parkinsonism. For example, disruptions of the ILF were negatively correlated with the severity and frequency of VHs and adversely affected visual attention. ,   Using FDG\u2010PET, Iaccarino and colleagues showed that the location of the most marked differences within and between the VNs, DMN, ventral attention network, and DAN relate to the presence or absence of VHs.  The involvement of the VN in VHs was confirmed in a study by Sala and colleagues.  Concerning the coherence in EEG bands, a reduced connectivity strength in the alpha band correlated with VH scores, thus supporting the role of alpha oscillations in attention and their link to VHs.  Likewise, a diminished coupling of theta oscillations was related to VHs. \n\nIn addition, several studies ,   showed a correlation between WM integrity and cognitive function, a relationship that extended to the intactness of the alpha band network. Precisely, reduced intra\u2010 and interhemispheric connectivity in the alpha band was accompanied by worse cognitive performance in various tests. ,  ,   However, the correlation between alpha network characteristics and clinical variables was not confirmed by another study.  In addition to global cognitive decline, DLB is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, which have been associated with disruptions in frontoparietal connections. ,   Nevertheless, depending on the brain region, both decreases and increases in functional connectivity have been implicated in cognitive fluctuations.  Similarly, in a study by Peraza and colleagues,  greater regional homogeneity in the bilateral cuneus was accompanied by higher cognitive fluctuation scores. \n\nRegarding motor symptoms, WM disruptions in the fornix  corresponded to the severity of motor symptoms. In contrast, higher correlations in the basal ganglia and limbic networks have been related to parkinsonism and mood disturbances.  However, it has been discussed that the association of motor disturbances with the limbic system is not direct, but perhaps caused by their co\u2010occurrence with affective symptoms. ,  \n\nDespite the described associations between connectivity disruptions and DLB core clinical features, these associations did not consistently materialize in all studies. ,  ,  ,  ,   This may be attributable to the diverse range of symptoms in patients with DLB, since the presence of two core clinical features or the combination of one core clinical feature and one indicative biomarker merit a diagnosis of probable DLB according to current diagnostic criteria.  Although a few studies tried to counter this heterogeneity by screening their patient cohort for one specific clinical feature,  the small number of patients with DLB (n\u2009\u2264\u200925) and the varied manifestation of the disease may explain the diversity of findings. Hence, guiding the choice of ROIs and/or seed regions by the core clinical features of DLB may contribute to more congruent results. The recent emergence of global consortia  and their promotion of large multicenter studies will boost the power of future studies to examine the associations between imaging measures and the clinical features of DLB. ,  ,   We thus envision that some of these associations will be elucidated in the coming years. \n\n\n### Clinical Implications and Connectivity Measures Along the Progression of the Disease \n  \nAlthough the investigation of connectivity, as opposed to regional differences in volume and functions, has only recently picked up pace, the studies summarized in this systematic review indicate that connectivity measures have the potential to become suitable biomarkers for DLB in the future. \n\nAlthough not explicitly formulated as connectivity measures, FDG\u2010PET and EEG already have a place as supportive biomarkers in the current diagnostic criteria for DLB.  Likewise, the recent diagnostic criteria for prodromal DLB list FDG\u2010PET and EEG as potential biomarkers. \n\nSeveral studies ,  ,  ,   found positive correlations between the integrity of WM tracts and cortical thickness in the connected brain regions, suggesting an at least equivalent diagnostic value of connectivity measures compared with conventional measures. A study demonstrated that brain regions with altered WM properties overlapped with areas showing glucose hypometabolism,  illuminating the link between network structure and function. Especially in the early stages of the disease, connectivity measures in DLB may not only mirror but also provide ancillary information to volumetric measures. This is supported by studies ,   that showed that WM differences emerged in the absence of detectable gray matter (GM) atrophy. To reconstruct in which order WM and GM alterations appear in the disease process of DLB and to which extent one drives the other, longitudinal assessments are necessary. Nevertheless, the available literature already speaks for a clinically valuable sensitivity of WM disruptions to changes early in the disease progress. Indeed, disruptions in NBM WM projections were superior to NBM volume in predicting the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DLB.  Although the current research criteria for prodromal DLB  emphasize the predictive power of quantitative EEG, connectivity measures remain regretfully underappreciated notwithstanding that differences to HCs were already detectable at the MCI stage in many measures presented in this review. Early disruptions occurred in oscillatory networks.  Likewise, patients at the mild dementia stage spent more time in a sparser connected state compared with HCs.  In addition, Huber and colleagues  observed an increase in metabolic connectivity at the early disease stages, which was interpreted as a compensatory process to counter the beginning of dopamine deficiency. With increasing dopamine deficiency in later disease stages, metabolic connectivity breaks down, possibly indicating advanced neurodegeneration. Although these results suggest that network alterations can be adduced as early biomarkers in DLB, they also indicate that alterations may be difficult to capture when measurements occur around a putative inflection point, thus providing a possible explanation for the null findings by some authors. \n\nSo far, the evidence on longitudinal connectivity changes is very limited, as the only longitudinal study to date did not detect any WM changes accruing in a year.  As 1\u2009year is a relatively short time period, longer follow\u2010ups are needed to establish whether connectivity changes continue to accrue over time. In the future, a greater number of longitudinal studies covering different imaging modalities, combined with postmortem assessments of cortical Lewy body pathology, will be indispensable to characterize the progression of the neurodegenerative process driven by \u03b1\u2010synuclein\u2013related pathology in DLB. Multimodal longitudinal studies that combine assessments of structural and functional connectivity will be of particular interest to disentangle the complex relationship between structural and functional neural changes in the disease progress of DLB. The knowledge of whether early functional changes drive structural changes or initial structural changes lead to the deterioration of function will allow us to gauge potential compensatory effects and how those may be exploited for treatment purposes. \n\nConnectivity measures were sensitive to treatment effects inasmuch as patients not receiving donepezil exhibited more widespread disruptions in the beta band network than patients taking the medication.  In addition, Colloby and colleagues  probed the cholinergic M /M  receptor after 12\u2009weeks of donepezil treatment. They revealed distinct binding patterns that correlated with improvements in cognitive and VH scores. This suggests that the value of tracing changes in the cholinergic network in DLB is not restricted to reconstructing the disease progress possibly from the early stages onward. Instead, the integrity of the cholinergic network may be adduced to predict and monitor treatment response. These studies not only imply that the intake of medication may have obscured more consistent findings but also they point to the necessity of stratifying patients in terms of their medication to render a systematic characterization possible. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIn this systematic review, we attempted to cover all relevant literature on the topic of connectivity in DLB. Meta\u2010analyses can provide a quantitative summary of the existing literature, but the heterogeneity in imaging modalities and analytic procedures within modalities made this approach unfeasible. \n\nThe JBI criteria indicated that some methodological issues should be considered. In particular, PET\u2010based connectivity studies tended to be classified into the low\u2010quality category of the JBI because of the lack of information about the HCs or not completely taking demographical group differences into account. Moreover, most PET studies did not correct for motion artifacts or signal decay, which may have partly interfered with quantitative accuracy. ,   However, the results of the PET studies are largely consistent with each other and the results of other imaging modalities, which encouraged us to retain them as a relevant part of the reviewed literature. \n\nLikewise, the impact of patients' medications on connectivity measures should be further investigated. The results on the impact of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on connectivity measures vary. ,  ,  ,   In addition, this review showed that antiparkinson agents, antipsychotics, and antidepressants are also commonly prescribed to patients with DLB, and their effects on connectivity measures should be considered in future research. \n\nThis review highlights the need for more connectivity studies in DLB, especially in currently underrepresented modalities such as GMNs and SPECT. Moreover, the value of other imaging modalities in assessing connectivity differences between patients with DLB and HCs is still uncharted, for example, magnetoencephalography (MEG). Its relatively high spatial and temporal resolution makes MEG a promising tool to uncover connectivity differences between patients with DLB and HCs. In addition, other analysis techniques can be applied to outline abnormal neural patterns. Among those, principal component analysis was previously used to reveal metabolic patterns in FDG\u2010PET in patients with DLB. ,  \n\nAside from the sensitivity to disease\u2010related aspects in DLB, connectivity measures also need to demonstrate specificity to be considered a valuable biomarker for DLB. So far, only two EEG\u2010based connectivity studies provided details on classification accuracy when differentiating HCs from DLB and prodromal DLB, reaching a moderate classification accuracy in both cases. ,   Given the heterogeneous clinical phenotype of DLB, the moderate classifier performance should not be neglected. This also underscores the potential need for adjusting cutoffs according to the patient's clinical presentation in addition to exploring the discriminatory power of connectivity measures in other imaging modalities. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCongruent findings across distinct imaging modalities testify to the value of assessing connectivity in DLB. Which of the discussed methods provides the best predictive value and aligns more closely with clinical phenotype in DLB cannot be established at present because direct comparisons between imaging modalities are still missing. In addition, it should be considered that the various imaging modalities catch different time scales. Although DTI and PET are appropriate tools for the assessment of a trait, the high temporal resolution of EEG qualifies it for assessing a state. Gauging the disease state may be particularly important in DLB, which is characterized by cognitive fluctuations on different time scales. Although parallels emerged between structural and functional disintegration in DLB, more studies are needed to probe the structural basis of functional networks in DLB in greater depth. Apart from collecting multimodal data, future studies should place more emphasis on acquiring data in larger and better characterized patient populations, factoring in brain state, symptomatology, and medication use of individual patients. This development is facilitated by the recent establishment of large multicenter cohorts in different national and international consortia. \n\nIn conclusion, connectivity measures show great potential to capture brain disruptions in patients with DLB, possibly before regional volumetric differences can be observed. Tracing connectivity disruptions may be of particular importance given the often limited level of atrophy encountered in DLB, especially in its prodromal stage. \n\n\n## Author Roles \n  \n(1) Research Project: A.

In particular, fMRI has been used to characterize spatiotemporal hemodynamic response to pharmacological challenges as a non-invasive readout of neuronal activity. However, the mechanisms underlying regional signal changes are yet unclear. In this study, we use a meta-analytic approach to converge data from microdialysis experiments with relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) changes following acute administration of neuropsychiatric drugs in adult male rats. At whole-brain level, the functional response patterns show very weak correlation with neurochemical alterations, while for numerous brain areas a strong positive correlation with noradrenaline release exists. At a local scale of individual brain regions, the rCBV response to neurotransmitters is anatomically heterogeneous and, importantly, based on a complex interplay of different neurotransmitters that often exert opposing effects, thus providing a mechanism for regulating and fine tuning hemodynamic responses in specific regions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used non-invasive technology that allows mapping of brain activity at rest  or in response to specific sensory stimuli, cognitive tasks  or neuromodulatory and neurovascular activity induced by pharmacological agents;  all by measuring spatiotemporal changes in blood flow, volume or blood oxygenation. In so-called pharmacological MRI (phMRI) experiments, acute administration of drugs induces local or global hemodynamic responses that can be detected with methods sensitive to different types of magnetization-relaxation processes yielding functional signals. While such functional MRI-signals (fMRI) can be causally linked to various types of neuronal and glial, e.g. astrocytic, activity,  the actual, condition-specific neurochemical processes underlying the related phMRI signal changes remain elusive. Until now, two main strategies have been commonly pursued for gaining insights into the neurovascular mechanisms underlying phMRI responses. First, the dynamics of signals measured with different MRI methodologies were examined following local or systemic injection of various agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators;  and second, phMRI experiments were combined with concurrent microdialysis,  aiming to fathoming into the correlations between changes in neurotransmitter concentrations and the magnitude of alterations in cerebral blood circulation. Such studies reported similar time courses for changes in the functional signal and the substance-concentration measured by microdialysis.  Yet microdialysis has limited spatial and temporal resolution, and most importantly, assessment of brain-wide neurochemical dynamics by means of such a minimally invasive method remains practically impossible. \n\nIn the present study, we report an alternative method that overcomes the latter problem by means of a mathematical-statistical, meta-analysis strategy. Specifically, while individual microdialysis experiments are restricted to measurements in single brain regions of interest (ROI), the number of studies, and thus the number of examined ROI, is vast. Therefore, microdialysis sessions collectively, if properly normalized, can converge into a whole-brain neurochemical map  consistent with fMRI measurements. The aim of the present study has therefore been to achieve a data-convergence, by normalizing, summarizing and integrating phMRI and microdialysis data published studies in adult rats ( ). Our analysis was conducted on phMRI and microdialysis time-series of brain response patterns to a selection of systemically administered neuropsychiatric drugs (amphetamine, apomorphine, cocaine, fluoxetine, nicotine, phencyclidine (PCP) and yohimbine). Our selection was prompted by the fact that these drugs represent different molecular modes of action, e.g. interactions with dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and glutamate systems, as well as discrete therapeutic/behavioral effects. Thereby, time-series of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and the temporal profile of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations with comparable sampling rates were extracted from published studies and transformed into multidimensional whole-brain response patterns, expressed by matrices of different size. Since microdialysis experiments often only provide data on changes of a limited number of transmitters in one brain region, an extensive meta-analysis was conducted to construct the whole-brain response matrix for each neurochemical system. By focusing on normalized peak response to drugs and a ROI-based averaging, we reduced data complexity and dimension. Subsequently, we developed and applied a meta-analysis-based approach, which enables us to calculate Pearson correlations of drug-induced peak hemodynamic response and peak neurotransmitter concentration changes at whole-brain level. \n  \nSchematic illustration of the convergence of spatiotemporal rCBV maps and microdialysis time-series to correlation matrices. In the first step, time-series for each observable type, namely phMRI and neurochemical data, are extracted from published studies. Each phMRI experiment provides rCBV time-series for 39 cortical and subcortical brain regions for baseline and post-injection phase. In turn, each in vivo microdialysis experiment provides trajectories of basal and drug-induced changes of neurotransmitter concentrations in only one brain region. As previously reported, measurements in up to 117 brain regions can be obtained. In order to reduce the data complexity and dimension, only the peak response and the time to peak from microdialysis experiments are extracted and converted into matrices for each transmitter with rows representing the brain regions and columns representing the drugs. In analogy, the peaks response and time were extracted from rCBV time-series. Subsequently, for rCBV experiments, the brain-wide response pattern to each drug is expressed by a normalized vector such that each component denotes the peak hemodynamic response in one brain region. Collectively, these vectors form a matrix that contains information on all drugs. The neurochemical brain-wide response pattern to each drug is expressed by a symmetric matrix with components denoting the response of a specific neurotransmitter within a specific brain region. In contrast to rCBV matrices that contain data from one experiment, the neurochemical matrices contain meta-analysed data of numerous microdialysis experiments. In the final step, a vector-matrix correlation analysis converges all data into information on similarity and differences of the two observable types. \n  \nWhile numerous methods for analyzing the correlation of time-series of consistent sampling rate exist, analysis of datasets with differing spatiotemporal scale is a challenging problem, for which a generalized mathematical scheme is developed in this study. In addition, the influence of different variables, parameters and individual studies on overall findings was assessed by sensitivity analyses and demonstrates the robustness of the results. \n\nDue to the spatial, morphological heterogeneity of the brain, different brain regions are likely to have distinct neurochemical underpinning of phMRI signals.  To investigate whether and to what degree similarities and differences at ROI-level influence the whole-brain statistics and observations, we conducted secondary correlation and cluster analyses on a representative set (caudate putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, septum and raphe nuclei) of cortical and subcortical brain areas. These brain regions play key roles within the mood, reward, and addiction neurocircuitries,  which are known to be affected by the drugs under investigation in this study, particularly psychostimulants, antidepressants. Therefore, understanding the relationship between neurochemical and functional signals within these regions will not only improve our understanding of the hemodynamic response but may generate new hypotheses on the complex chemical interactions within brain networks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Neurochemical dataset \n  \nAs reported in our previous studies,  drug-induced alterations in extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations as measured by in vivo microdialysis experiments in rats were extracted systematically and meta-analyzed to estimate averaged, normalized (i.e. baseline levels set to 100%) neurochemical response profiles. The matrices were obtained from Syphad database ( )  for amphetamine, apomorphine, cocaine, fluoxetine, and nicotine. In analogy to data mining and integration steps of Syphad, the online portal of the National Library of Medicine ( ) including PubMed, PubMed Central and MEDLINE was used as the platform for literature research for phencyclidine and yohimbine. A systematic screening of the original research articles published until 01.01.2019 was performed based on the keywords rat (AND) microdialysis (AND) (brain region (OR) neurotransmitter (OR) metabolite (OR) neuropeptide) (AND) (phencyclidine (OR) PCP (OR) yohimbine). The keyword neurotransmitter is a general representative in the search string which was replaced by the actual name and/or abbreviation of transmitters and metabolites (e.g. dopamine, glutamate, homovanilic acid/HVA, etc.). In addition, the reference sections of identified papers as well as review and meta-analysis articles were then screened for further relevant citations. Only peer-reviewed original research articles in English language were chosen for data mining if they provided the absolute or relative change in neurotransmitter or metabolite concentrations within a brain region either numerically or in graphical manner. We excluded articles using animals other than rats. All selected studies were performed in outbred rats with no specific genotype or phenotype or provided data for a wild-type control group were included. Furthermore, animals did not receive any behavioral training prior to drug treatments. Abstracts and unpublished studies were not included. \n\nIn general, each microdialysis experiment provides time-series of basal concentration and drug-induced changes (in minute scale) for a limited number of neurotransmitters and metabolites within one brain region. These time-series are presented often as figures in the literature. Since microdialysis experiments are often conducted with different sampling rates, we only extract the peak response (x ) of a transmitter to the drug normalized to its baseline value and the time of the peak. In our previous studies,  we conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses since the choice of fixed vs. random effect models depends strongly on the hypothesis as well as the extent of heterogeneity. In particular, if all included studies included in the analysis are reporting an estimate of the same effect and our goal is to calculate the overall effect size for the identified population without generalization to other populations, then a fixed effect model is more appropriate.  In the present study, we compute random effect weighted averages for subgroups with minimized level of heterogeneity in experimental design, e.g. meta-analysis of the changes in a particular neurotransmitter such as glutamate in a specific brain region such as prefrontal cortex following a specific dosage of a drug. Due to the skewness of experimental designs towards male, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats, the expected level of heterogeneity is low. Nevertheless, the statistical heterogeneity can influence the findings and reduce our ability to draw robust overall conclusions. Thus, we calculated I  which describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity,  \u03c4  which denotes between-study heterogeneity and then calculated random-effect meta-analyses by integrating \u03c4  into the weights. To this end, we first calculated the weighted (using precisions w  as weights) fixed effect average of study estimates X\u2009=\u2009\u2211w x /\u2211w , as introduced by Higgins and Thompson.  We then conduct the Cochran Q-test of homogeneity, Q\u2009=\u2009\u2211w (x -X).  A moment-based estimate for \u03c4  is then given as \u03c4 \u2009=\u2009(Q-df)/(\u2211w -(\u2211w \u2211w )), where df denotes degrees of freedom. Furthermore, I  statistics is calculated by I \u2009=\u2009((Q-df)/Q)\u00d7100%. While thresholds for the interpretation of I  can be inaccurate, we follow Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( ) and consider I <40% as less important. The random effect weighted average is obtained by adding the between-study heterogeneity into the weights. Therefore, if \u03c4 \u226a\u03c3  (variance of the study), then fixed and random effect models yield the same results, meaning that heterogeneity between studies does not affect the findings. This approach was further used to compute weighted averages of peak times (t ). Since the meta-analyses refer to different regions of interest, one may assume that the ROIs are provided (or nested) within studies, so that a hierarchical meta-analysis model would be more appropriate. However, less than 5% of all microdialysis studies provide information on several ROIs in a single report. Therefore, a hierarchical analysis was not applied. \n\nCalculations were conducted in MATLAB R2015a. Results did not differ from estimates provided by metafor package in R.  Codes, extracted data and results of random-effect meta-analyses and heterogeneity analyses are provided on the Center for Open Science platform ( ). \n\nWith respect to concentration changes, the neurochemical matrix contains in each entry an average of normalized peak response of a particular neurotransmitter within a specific brain region. Thereby, amino acids, monoamines and their direct metabolites represent 95.2% of all matrix entries. Consequently, no statistically reliable conclusions can be made for other transmitter systems. Thus, the analysis was focused on response profiles of acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (5-HT). \n\n\n### Neurochemical response profiles \n  \nFor each drug-dose combination, the response profile was presented as a numerical matrix with rows denoting the measured changes in neurotransmitter concentration and the columns presented brain areas within the neurochemical connectome of rat brain.  In order to represent the data intuitively, i.e. decrease in concentration as a loss and increase as a gain in neurotransmitter concentration, data were converted by subtracting 100% from all data points. In other words, the drug effect on brain neurochemistry is reflected in the sign of the matrix components. As drugs were administered in different doses, numerous (  k  ) matrices (R )  per drug exist, whose elements refer to the change of a transmitter   i  , in brain region   j  . \n\nSince, the matrices (R )  contain the outcome of meta-analyses, i.e. average values of numerous microdialysis experiments, the maximum peak does not relate to outliers but to largest average values. To this end, we constructed a matrix M, such that each of its elements M \u2009=\u2009max (R )  if (R ) >0 and M \u2009=min (R )  if (R ) <0. An exploration of the temporal dynamics of drug-induced alterations of extracellular neurotransmitter dynamics as a function of drug dose (Supplementary Information, Table S1) outlines considerable differences between the both time-course of response and dose conditions across the assays for each compound. Therefore, a dynamical convergence of the matrices is not feasible. \n\nThe different spatial resolution of MRI and microdialysis experiments poses a further problem, as the anatomical ontologies are inconsistent. To overcome this issue, we converge the terminology of neurochemical connectome of rat brain  and stereotaxic MRI template  into a coarse-grained ontological framework analogous (Supplementary Information, Table S2) to our previous studies.  The use of this ontology results in multiple cases of many-to-one mappings, for example, subregions of the \u2018lateral hypothalamus\u2019 and \u2018medial hypothalamus\u2019 are assigned to the (coarser) label of \u2018hypothalamus\u2019. In order to resolve this issue, a weighted ROI-average of neurotransmitter changes within all sub-regions was calculated using the numpy ( ) function \u2018np.average\u2019 in python, with the \u2018weights\u2019 parameter set to the number of rats. It is noteworthy that the heterogeneity in the cytoarchitecture often indicates that an averaging without considering anatomical properties is not optimal. However, the comparably small standard deviation of the matrix entries among sub-regions suggests that, from statistical point of view, the sub-region specific differences are negligible and averaging is admissible. \n\nThe resulting neurochemical response matrix (Supplementary Information, Figure S1) outlines how the seven drugs selected for this analysis comprise diverse neurochemical response patterns. For example, the prefrontal cortex and dopamine (CORTEX, PREFRONTAL and DA in the figure) show a mixture of both up or down response profiles across the six compounds profiled within this region. This is an intended consequence from the selection of diverse compounds for this work, since this enables the correlation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and neurochemical response across a variety of compound mechanism-of-actions (MOAs). \n\n\n### phMRI dataset \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging techniques enable the detection of hemodynamics (cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) or oxygenation level of hemoglobin (BOLD)) response to changes in the activity of neuronal populations in proximity of blood vessels. For pharmacological stimuli, previous studies  have shown a spatiotemporal coupling between the percent changes in CBV and BOLD relaxation rates. Nonetheless, CBV shows a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than BOLD, and was used as the detection method underlying the data used in this study. CBV experiments provide T *- or T -weighted image time series of transient drug-induced changes in blood volume with respect to a local resting state blood volume obtained by a contrast agent-enhanced relaxivity. The relative CBV (rCBV) is then obtained from the measured signal S(t), the estimated background signal in absence of the transient functional stimuli (B(t)) and the signal intensity prior to the administration of the contrast agent (S ):   rCBV  (  t  )  \u2009=\u2009ln  (  S  (  t  )/  B  (  t  ))/  ln  (  B  (  t  )/  S  ). The peak response for different brain regions was extracted from the time-course of rCBV(t) that were made available by Angelo Bifone (IIT, Italy). The measurements have been previously processed and reported for 1\u2009mg/kg D-amphetamine (  n  \u2009=\u200917) i.v.,  0.2\u2009mg/kg apomorphine (  n  \u2009=\u20095) i.v.,  0.5\u2009mg/kg cocaine (  n  \u2009=\u20098) i.v.,  10\u2009mg/kg fluoxetine (  n  \u2009=\u20097) i.p.,  0.35\u2009mg/kg nicotine (  n  \u2009=\u20099) i.v.,  0.5\u2009mg/kg phencyclidine (  n  \u2009=\u200924) i.v.  and 0.75\u2009mg/kg yohimbine (  n  \u2009=\u20096) i.v. \n\nAll animals used in the experiments were male adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Brain region designations were defined by the stereotaxic MRI template set for the rat brain  and converged into the joint ontological framework (Supplementary Information, Table S2) as described above. Compound rCBV response was averaged into one value for each brain in the case of many-to-one ontology mappings (due to the nature of going from high to lower resolution), resulting into coarse-grained matrix for hemodynamic response (Supplementary Information, Figure S2). \n\n\n### Neurochemical and MRI response profile correlation analysis \n  \nCompound neurochemical response profiles for each brain region-neurotransmitter pair as well as the corresponding brain-region specific rCBV responses were extracted. Pearson correlation was calculated between the two numerical arrays by using the scipy ( ) function scipy.stats.pearsonr in python. The output of this calculation \u03c1 is a real number ranging from \u22121.0 (perfect negative correlation, i.e. rCBV changes are opposite to neurochemical alterations) to 1.0 (i.e. perfect correlation, where rCBV changes respond in an identical way to alterations of neurochemical levels). We consider \u03c1\u2009=\u20090 as no correlation, 0<|\u03c1|<0.2 as very weak, 0.2\u2264|\u03c1|<0.4 as weak, 0.4\u2264|\u03c1|<0.6 as moderate, 0.6\u2264|\u03c1|<0.8 as strong, and 0.8\u2264|\u03c1|<1 as very strong correlation  indicating the strength of shared response between rCBV or neurochemical spaces upon compound administration. While confidence intervals of the correlations are provided, we report all correlation values including the non-significant relations as potential trends that may require further investigation in future studies. No individual study skewed the overall statistics; however, the inclusion and exclusion of specific drugs and/or neurotransmitter systems may affect the final findings. Thus, OFAT (one-factor-at-a-time) sensitivity analyses were performed a posteriori to ensure the robustness of the analysis results with respect to effect modifiers. \n\n\n### Bi-cluster analysis of correlation results across brain region and neurotransmitters \n  \nHierarchical bi-clustering of the correlation results was performed using the matrix of Pearson correlation values for the compounds across each neurotransmitter and brain region tuple, using the Seaborn \u2018clustermap\u2019 function with the method set to \u2018average\u2019, and the metric set to \u2018Euclidean\u2019. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe keyword-based search of abstracts, titles, or both identified 2449 publications. Out of these, 774 studies were original research articles on in vivo microdialysis in 22,489 rat brains and provided data for neurochemical meta-analysis. The phMRI studies and the majority microdialysis experiments were conducted in adult (89.1%), male (90.5%), Sprague-Dawley rats (67.9%), while there were variations in other experimental parameters used in microdialysis studies (Supplementary Information, Figure S3). In contrast to phMRI studies, 88.7% of microdialysis experiments (  n  \u2009=\u200920,383) were conducted in awake, freely moving animals. Thereby, the choice of anesthetic agents and the applied concentrations varied notably (Supplementary Information, Table S3). The heterogeneity analyses suggest that in 20% of cases the I  was larger than 40% and the fixed- and random effect model results differed. Nevertheless, only 2.5% of such cases were associated with potential effect modifiers such as age, strain and use of anesthesia. For instance, administration of 10\u2009mg/kg cocaine increased dopamine concentration in adolescent animals by 306\u2009\u00b1\u20093% and thus, significantly less (  p\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05, one-way ANOVA) than in adult rats (371\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2%). \n\nHeterogeneity tests further suggest that the application of anesthesia affects the striatal dopaminergic response to 10\u2009mg/kg of phencyclidine. While data obtained from awake, freely moving animals suggest study homogeneity (\u03c4 \u2009=\u20090.02; I \u2009=\u200933%; random-effect mean: 252% with 95% confidence interval: [234, 270]), the application of anesthesia is associated with significant (  p  \u2009<\u20090.00001) heterogeneity (\u03c4 \u2009=\u20090.27; I \u2009=\u200994%; random-effect mean: 232% with 95% confidence interval: [173, 292]). Therefore, in spite of few exceptions, the analyses reported in this study remain largely robust with respect to experimental parameters. \n\n### Common features of neurochemical response \n  \nWe extracted and conducted meta-analysis on percentage changes in neurotransmitter (i.e. acetylcholine (ACh), 5-HT, dopamine (DA), GABA, glutamate (Glu), and noradrenaline (NA)) concentrations relative to basal levels within 18 cortical and subcortical brain areas (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, caudate putamen, frontal cortex, globus pallidus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, raphe, septum, substantia nigra, temporal cortex, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area). The drugs under consideration were applied systematically in wide ranges of doses: amphetamine (0.2\u2013 30\u2009mg/kg), apomorphine (0.1\u20133\u2009mg/kg), cocaine (0.05\u201340\u2009mg/kg), fluoxetine (0.3\u201340\u2009mg/kg), nicotine (0.05\u2013135\u2009mg/kg), phencyclidine (0.3\u201320\u2009mg/kg) and yohimbine (0.1\u20135\u2009mg/kg). The heterogeneity tests of the in vivo microdialysis experiments suggest that the study estimates are largely homogeneous (median \u03c4 \u2009=\u20090.02; median I \u2009=\u200927.61%). However, 18.3% of the cases showed considerable heterogeneity (i.e. 75%\u2009<I \u2009<\u2009100%) that justifies the choice of random-effect model for meta-analysis. \n\nThereby, the results suggest diverse dynamical patterns for different neurotransmitter systems, which show different levels of sensitivity to specific molecular modes of action of the drugs. All drugs in all doses increase 5-HT and ACh levels in all investigate brain areas by approximately 247\u2009\u00b1\u200930% and 188\u2009\u00b1\u200911%. However, apomorphine in the range of 0.3\u20133\u2009mg/kg moderately reduced ACh levels in caudate putamen from 10 to 25%. Moreover, apomorphine reduced dopamine levels in caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex by up to 73%. All other drug-dose combinations increase dopamine levels notably in cortical and subcortical brain regions (in average 464\u2009\u00b1\u200941%). GABA dynamics represents a non-linear response pattern, that timing but not in magnitude, is opposite to glutamatergic response. In particular, low concentrations of nicotine and apomorphine reduce GABA levels in subcortical structures such as hypothalamus and ventral pallidum, and in prefrontal cortex whereas phencyclidine and amphetamine and higher concentrations of apomorphine enhance GABA concentrations in globus pallidus (\u223c160%), caudate putamen (\u223c187%), septum (\u223c210%), and prefrontal cortex (\u223c 200%). Glutamate in turn is increased by all drugs by approximately 77\u2009\u00b1\u200914%, but 10\u2009mg/kg of fluoxetine which reduces Glu levels in frontal cortex by 40%. NA as well is enhanced by all drugs by in average 245\u2009\u00b1\u200976%. \n\n\n### Common features of hemodynamic response \n  \nAs previously reported,  hemodynamic response to drug challenges was associated with selective activation of pathways based on their molecular modes of action and in a dose-dependent manner. These findings will be briefly summarized in the following. While amphetamine induces an anatomically indistinctive activation of the brain, the response to other drugs including psychostimulants such as cocaine and phencyclidine was specific. In particular, cocaine injection leads to the significant activation of various cortical (such as prefrontal, frontal, and cingulate) and subcortical (caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus) areas that are associated with reward circuitry. Significant positive rCBV changes (  Z\u2009  >  \u2009  2.3 vs. vehicle, cluster correction at   p\u2009  \u2009=\u2009  \u2009  0.05) induced by phencyclidine were observed in cortico-limbo-thalamic regions (medial prefrontal, cingulate, orbito-frontal, and retrosplenial cortices), with extension into the motor, visual, parietal-, and temporal association and rhinal cortices. Significant activation was further observed in subcortical brain regions such as extended amygdala, thalamus and postero-dorsal, antero-dorsal and ventral and posterior hippocampus. Fluoxetine, in turn, shows a largely cortical effect as well as foci in the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and in the thalamus.  Similarly, yohimbine administration leads to the activations in several cortico-limbic areas (  Z\u2009  >  \u2009  2.3,   p  <0.01) such as prefrontal, cingulate, orbito-frontal, and retrosplenial cortex, with extension into the motor, visual, parietal-, and temporal-association areas. Moreover, in addition to extra-hypothalamic stress circuit (e.g. extended amygdala), hemodynamic response in subcortical structures such as caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial and dorsolateral thalamus, and ventral hippocampal area was significantly increased. The administration of either apomorphine or nicotine induces significant activation in particularly strong effects in the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortices, in the insular cortex extending back to the ectorhinal/perirhinal cortices and thalamus. Nicotine further enhances rCBV in the amygdala, ventrocaudal hippocampal structures, and nucleus accumbens. Taken together, the overall phMRI findings indicate largely overlapping cortical (prefrontal cortex) and subcortical (Hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, septum, caudate putamen and ventral tegmental area) hemodynamic response patterns due to the action of these neuropsychiatric drugs under investigation. \n\n\n### Correlation analyses \n  \nThe analysis of similarities between hemodynamic response and changes of neurotransmitter concentrations induced by individual drugs at whole-brain level suggest very strong correlations of 5-HT (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.88) and noradrenaline (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.81) for nicotine, 5-HT (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.82) and GABA (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.99) for phencyclidine and moderate negative correlations of ACh (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.48) and 5-HT (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.43) for amphetamine. For other drugs, i.e. apomorphine, cocaine, fluoxetine and yohimbine, neurochemistry either very weakly or weakly correlates with rCBV, and thus no meaningful conclusion can be drawn. \n\nIn order to discover common principles, we calculated how neurochemical and functional response patterns correlate for the set of all drugs. The analysis suggests that changes in cerebral blood volume, while relating to penetrating arteries and cortical layers,  correlate only very weakly with changes in neurotransmitter concentration as measured by microdialysis at whole-brain level (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.089, \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.088, \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009 0.043, \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.025, \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.010, \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.101). Interestingly, the sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Information, Tables S4 and S5) suggest that the exclusion of each individual drug, but amphetamine, does not alter the statistical findings. Excluding amphetamine from the set of drugs leads to strong positive correlations of hemodynamic response with noradrenaline (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.60), and strong negative correlation with GABA (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.64). It is noteworthy that amphetamine increases noradrenaline concentrations and rCBV response in all brain regions, the response magnitude at whole-brain level is negatively correlated (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.33), which may result into a diminishing correlation of NA and hemodynamic response due to an individual drug (Supplementary Information, Table S6). \n\nThe lack of even moderate correlation of neurotransmitter and rCBV response to drugs at global, whole-brain level may further be due to spatial heterogeneity in terms of differences in neurovasculature, receptor distributions and cytoarchitecture of different brain areas. To evaluate the impact of spatial structural variability, we conducted a ROI-based correlation analysis (Supplementary Information, Figures S4 and S5). As previously reported,  there is a general skewness of microdialysis studies by means of an overemphasis on monoamine systems (particularly dopamine) within the reward circuitry, which is also reflected in the neurochemical database. The missing values related to other neurotransmitter systems and brain regions do not permit a complete correlation analysis for all regions of interest. In other cases, if data were provided for at least two of the seven drugs under consideration, then Pearson correlations of neurochemical and rCBV responses were calculated ( ). While this strategy allows us to conduct correlation analysis, the obtained correlation values directly relate to the number of drugs contributing to the calculation. Thereby, smaller numbers of drugs generally lead to higher magnitudes of correlations. Therefore, the findings are presented as pairs of Pearson correlation in brain region A for neurotransmitter B, \u03c1 , and number of drugs included in the analysis   m  , to avoid an over-interpretation of our findings (Supplementary Information, Table S7). All brain areas but caudate putamen show a positive correlation of noradrenaline transmission and a negative correlation of glutamate dynamics with hemodynamic response. In prefrontal cortex, alterations in ACh and NA correlate perfectly with changes in rCBV (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092), dopamine correlates moderately (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.57, m\u2009=\u20094), whereas 5-HT and glutamate are negatively correlated to hemodynamic response (\u03c1 \u2009=\u22120.27, m\u2009=\u20094; \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.86, m\u2009=\u20093). In hippocampus, GABA and NA changes correlate positively with functional response (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=0.46, m\u2009=\u20093), 5-HT and dopamine changes correlate negatively with rCBV changes (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.29, m\u2009=\u20093; \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22121, m\u2009=\u20092) and correlations between changes in acetylcholine concentrations and rCBV are negligible (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.007, m\u2009=\u20094). Dopamine dynamics perfectly correlates positively and negatively with hemodynamic response in globus pallidus, septum and hypothalamus, respectively (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22121, m\u2009=\u20092), while noradrenaline changes in hypothalamus positively correlate with rCBV response (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092). In raphe, drug-induced alterations in 5-HT levels are very strongly correlated to hemodynamic response (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.85, m\u2009=\u20093). Dopamine and 5-HT concentrations in the ventral tegmental area correlate with rCBV changes perfectly (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092), while glutamate system shows the opposite behavior (\u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22121, m\u2009=\u20092). A similar behavior can be observed in nucleus accumbens, where all transmitters but glutamate are positively correlated to changes in hemodynamic response (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.59, m\u2009=\u20093; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.51, m\u2009=\u20096; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.51, m\u2009=\u20095; \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.33, m\u2009=\u20094). In caudate putamen, all transmitter but noradrenaline correlate positively with rCBV changes (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20091, m\u2009=\u20092; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.89, m\u2009=\u20093; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.78, m\u2009=\u20096; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.77, m\u2009=\u20093; \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.29, m\u2009=\u20094; \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u22121, m\u2009=\u20092). It is noteworthy that m\u2009=\u20092 without an exception leads to perfect positive and negative correlation scores, indicating that it may not present an appropriate choice for discovering true patterns. In contrast, for m\u2009\u2265\u20093, correlation patterns emerge that show robustness with respect to brain areas. In average, drug-induced changes in glutamate levels appear negatively correlated with rCBV, whereas noradrenaline and dopamine systems are positively correlated with relative cerebral blood volume alterations. Thereby, 5-HT reveals a diverse response pattern, as it positively correlates with hemodynamic response in nucleus accumbens and raphe and negative correlations in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which may relate to serotoninergic projections in rat brain originating in raphe and strongly innervating nucleus accumbens with a weaker outreach of cortical regions.  While the rough sampling times of microdialysis experiments and differences in measurement time-scales with phMRI experiments did not allow a quantitative comparison of drug response trajectories, we analyzed peak response times (Supplementary Information, Table S8) to include the temporal dimension in our investigation. Thereby, the response time is negatively (Supplementary Information, Figure S6), yet not significantly (overall   p  \u2009=\u20090.57) correlated with the hemodynamic response for most neurotransmitters. In agreement with previous studies,  glutamate and GABA show an opposite dynamics, i.e. the Pearson coefficients for glutamate and GABA are of opposite sign. \n  \nRegion of interest (ROI)-based Pearson correlation between drug-induced neurochemical and hemodynamic response patterns shows an anatomical heterogeneity underlying the relationship between neurotransmitter concentrations and rCBV signal changes. The complex and region-specific interplays of different neurotransmitter systems generate hypotheses on internal functioning of different neurocircuitries in the brain. For instance, the push-pull action within VTA (positive for dopamine and 5-HT, negative for glutamate) appears to play a role in the regulation of hemodynamic response and the functional control of reward circuitry. Correlation values were calculated if data were provided for at least two of the seven drugs under consideration. Negative and positive correlations are presented as shades of blue and red, respectively. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nfMRI is widely used to study the operational organization of the brain. The exact relationship between the measured functional signal and the underlying neural activity, however, remains unclear. Previous studies  have examined the relationship between mesoscopic electrical signals (e.g. various frequency ranges of the mean extracellular field potential, often dubbed as Local Field Potentials, LFP) and neurovascular activity patterns, such as those reflecting changes in blood oxygenation. Extending this methodology by using multishank and multisite electrodes can also provide global neuronal and vascular activity patterns that may help interpreting brain states. However, a concurrent widespread mapping of the regional neurochemical processes reflecting the activity patterns induced, for example, by neuromodulators, is currently impossible, despite of its utmost importance for drug design and development. The gap is mainly due to the experimental limitations of neurochemical measurement techniques by biosensors or in vivo microdialysis. While these methods allow the observation of drug-induced alterations of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations at a small spatiotemporal scale, corresponding to a small number of voxels in the usual fMRI studies, simultaneous observation of drug effects on the entire brain is not possible, as the minimally invasive methods such as microdialysis \u2013 beyond their limited spatiotemporal resolution \u2013 have also restricted regional extent of sampling. Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) could \u2013 in principle \u2013 overcome the latter limitation, if local changes in the phMRI signals are consistently related to the concentration changes of different neuromodulators or drugs quantified by means of biosensors. In other words, a robust, potentially causal relationship between chemicals and phMRI signal changes, eventually permitting a linear (or non-linear) estimation of an impulse response function for various regions, which in turn allows the inverse estimation of local neurochemical changes by measuring the phMRI signal-changes could indeed permit a reliable convergence of regional data. Targeted pharmacological manipulation of neurotransmitter systems and simultaneous measurement of hemodynamic response has indeed already provided some insights into the effect of drugs on neurovascular coupling.  Puzzling, however is the fact that the changes in the fMRI signal are often induced by alterations in numerous dynamically coupled neurotransmitter systems that respond directly (by the drug acting on various proteins with different affinity) or indirectly (i.e. through network interactions) to the administration of neuropsychiatric drugs. While such sets of neurochemical systems are non-unique and may differ among drugs, the conjunction set (i.e. the ensemble of neurotransmitters associated with hemodynamic response that react non-specifically to all drugs) is unique and is critical to characterize the link between neurochemical and functional dynamics. \n\nUsing a set of representative neuropsychiatric drugs, we were indeed able to find the above-mentioned conjunction set as a universal neurochemical underpinning of hemodynamic response. Notably, our whole-brain correlation analysis did not directly lead to the identification of sets of neurotransmitters associated with functional signal changes. However, our sensitivity analyses suggest that the null-result is mostly due to two factors, namely the small number of drugs for which data exists and large variance in how different brain regions respond to drugs. Based on currently existing data, the robust core of our findings suggests a positive correlation of noradrenaline and a positive correlation of glutamatergic dynamics with hemodynamic response. This finding is in agreement with previous studies that have shown direct noradrenergic input to cerebral penetrating arteries and intracortical microvessels, indicating a direct role of noradrenaline in blood\u2013brain barrier and cerebral blood flow. \n\nSurprisingly, our analysis does not provide evidence that the magnitude of glutamate changes is driving the functional response (if anything, an anticorrelation was found). However, in agreement with recent functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS)  and combined fMRI-MRS  in humans, the time courses of changes in glutamate and BOLD signals induced by visual stimulation are positively correlated. Our findings are further consistent with an opposite dynamics of glutamate and GABA response to stimuli.  In addition, a feasible and clear indication of the implication of the noradrenergic system is identified. Both, glutamate and noradrenaline, are well-known to play key roles in neurovascular coupling, for instance via the regulation of astroglial function and cerebral microvascular  and thus, the intensity of fMRI signals. \n\nWhile inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptor generally blocks the vascular response, their activation by agonists leads to enhancements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes and consequently vasodilation as induced by neuronal stimulation.  Furthermore, simultaneous multimodal measurements of neuronal activity and glutamate concentration in thalamus indicate a positive correlation with functional signals.  However, the importance of astrocytes in regulation of cerebral blood flow remains unresolved. \n\nWe speculate that our inability to discover a positive correlation between the magnitude of glutamate-rCBV correlations is due to two reasons. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that is metabolized and released by neurons and also astrocytes.  Thereby, the astrocytes not only regulate the glutamate levels but the dynamics of this process may prevent observation of refined glutamatergic oscillations. Therefore, the rough time-resolution of microdialysis experiments (in minutes) leads to not only sampling active glutamate molecules associated with neurotransmission but also to an added concentration of free glutamate by astrocytes. This, in turn, affects the correlation analysis directly and may overshadow actual links between changes in glutamate concentration and hemodynamic response. \n\nHowever, the sign of the correlation may also relate to an anatomical gradient between cortical and subcortical regions, as neural activity appears to positively correlate with functional activity for cortical and negatively for subcortical regions.  Indeed, previous studies have shown a high level of anatomical heterogeneity in neurovasculature,  receptor distribution  and generally BOLD signal among different brain regions  that may have led to positive correlations in some and negative correlations in other brain areas and subsequently a net-zero (meaningless) correlation at whole-brain level. Nonetheless, the findings are based entirely on correlations without an exploration of confidence intervals and statistical significance. With growing number of experiments and data, the investigation needs to be complemented by such analyses to ensure robustness of the identified correlations. \n\nBeyond the global observations, our ROI-based analysis further suggests that the involvement of neurotransmitter systems in hemodynamic response is anatomically heterogeneous and that not a single neurochemical mechanism but rather a complex interplay of various transmitter systems contributes to neurovascular coupling. The correlation of rCBV changes with neurochemistry in the main source of dopaminergic projections within the reward circuitry, namely ventral tegmental area (VTA), is an example of this observation. Our findings suggest that a push-pull action (positive for dopamine and 5-HT, negative for glutamate) is responsible for the regulation of hemodynamic response and the functional control of this important brain region. Such complex and region-specific interplays of different neurotransmitter systems can also be used to improve our understanding and generate hypotheses on internal functioning of different neurocircuitries in the brain. For instance, a plausible observation is that dopamine correlates positively with rCBV within the mesolimbic system and exerts opposite effects in other regions. \n\nWhile our results are feasible in light of previous experimental findings, our study and its conclusions are intrinsically limited to the databases they rely on. phMRI measurements provide global, whole-brain observations; however, phMRI experiments have only been conducted using a small set of neuropsychiatric drugs. The opposite is true for microdialysis experiments that provide data for at least 260 drugs,  however often incomplete with respect to number of measured brain regions and transmitter systems. Furthermore, due to differences in time-scales of measurements, the presented analysis is only based on peak response (i.e. peak response magnitude and time) and not on spatiotemporal trajectories, which may contain critical information. In general, trajectories of dynamical systems depend on initial values/conditions and a proper analysis needs to take both the initial values and temporal dynamics into consideration. For instance, previous MRS investigations  indicate that different baseline conditions may explain diverging signal changes of GABA and glutamate. In the included microdialysis experiments, the animals were wild-type, drug-na\u00efve and did not undergo any behavioral manipulations (e.g. stress) prior to the measurements. Thus, one can safely assume that the baseline conditions are comparable. To our surprise, numerous studies do not report the basal concentrations. For example, 10 out of 15 studies on Yohimbine and over 50% of studies on PCP do not report basal values. Thus, if we set it as a key feature of the analysis, then numerous studies would have been excluded. In addition, it is noteworthy that the quantity of analyte collected by microdialysis (i.e. absolute concentration) often represents only a fraction of the \u2018true\u2019 extracellular neurotransmitter levels. Differences in concentrations of calcium (mM) of perfusate, flow rate (\u00b5l/min) or membrane surface area (often reported as membrane length (mm) and membrane outer-diameter (\u00b5m)) affect the relative recovery, i.e. the ratio between the actual extracellular concentration of an analyte and its dialysate concentration, significantly.  To avoid this issue, a large number of microdialysis studies on drug effects normalize the drug-induced response to the basal levels measured in the study and report exclusively the normalized (% baseline) values. Since rCBV, as well, represents a relative measure of drug response, the comparison of the two variables is feasible. \n\nA further limitation of our study is due to the fact that phMRI experiments are conducted in anesthetized animals, whereas the majority of microdialysis experiments were performed in awake, freely moving rats. While drug\u2013drug interactions generally may influence the findings in a critical manner, analysis of variance of microdialysis data obtained from awake and anesthetized rats for the drugs under consideration did not show any significant differences between the groups. However, the application of halothane may induce notable heterogeneity in measurements of striatal dopamine concentrations following acute administration of cocaine. While halothane is not a commonly used anesthetic agent in the context of functional neuroimaging, depending on the applied anesthesia, the outcome of phMRI may vary. Therefore, a more accurate comparison of phMRI and microdialysis experiments would benefit from phMRI data obtained from awake animals. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings suggest that the neurochemical basis of changes in functional MRI signals most likely relates to a dynamical interplay of glutamate and noradrenergic transmission in the brain. However, more phMRI data on preferably awake animals are required to detect the refined role of other transmitter systems such as dopamine, 5-HT and GABA in regulating the magnitude of functional signal changes. \n\n\n## Supplemental Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7983335, "text_md5": "b03de32d13f32d54617a4db6077bcfb2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 123], "journal": [124, 148], "publication_year": [150, 154], "title": [165, 294], "keywords": [308, 366], "abstract": [379, 1525], "body": [1534, 48901]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 32281457, "doi": "10.1177/0271678X20916003", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983335", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7983335"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983335\">7983335</a>", "list_title": "PMC7983335  Neurochemical underpinning of hemodynamic response to neuropsychiatric drugs: A meta- and cluster analysis of preclinical studies"}
