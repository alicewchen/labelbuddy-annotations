Moreover, we also included discussions on practices and research directions that validate fMRI studies in consumer neuroscience beyond data triangulation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince the dawn of consumer neuroscience, researchers have employed neuroimaging techniques, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to explore latent mental processes underlying consumer behavior (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Thanks to their collective effort through more than a decade of research, consumer neuroscientists have accumulated a wealth of insights that sheds light upon many aspects of consumer behavior. However, an unresolved challenge exists: that of reverse inference. Defined as the use of neuroimaging data to infer the presence of specific cognitive and affective processes ( ), reverse inference may be tricky when interpretating neuroimaging results ( ,  ;  ,  ). \n\nIn this article, we attempt to summarize potential issues associated with reverse inference, and we argue that proper data triangulation can help address these issues. Herein, we define data triangulation as the practice of utilizing multiple methods and data sources to study the same phenomenon ( ;  ). In neuroimaging research, triangulation would thus entail integrating neuroimaging data with data from meta-analyses, psychometric assessments, and consumer behavior. \n\nBecause the neuroimaging techniques employed in consumer neuroscience often consist of fMRI, we focus exclusively on fMRI research in our review of research papers, examinations of research methods, and recommendations to consumer researchers (hereinafter, we use the terms \u201cneuroimaging\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d synonymously). However, many of our analyses and recommendations could possibly be applied to other imaging techniques as well. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, we review more than 50 empirical articles employing fMRI techniques published in consumer and marketing research journals as well as neuroscience journals, and we use this review to discusses fMRI\u2019s contributions to consumer research. Second, we discuss two major interpretative approaches of neuroimaging research\u2014forward inference and reverse inference\u2014and explain how these approaches contribute to understanding consumer behavior. Third, we discuss potential issues and challenges associated with reverse inference. Fourth, we argue that the utilization of data triangulation of fMRI data with meta-analytic data as well as psychometric and behavioral data can enhance the validity of fMRI studies. Fifth, we provide and discuss several recommendations for future consumer neuroscience research. \n\n\n## Functional Neuroimaging in Consumer Research \n  \nOver the past one and a half decades, the field of consumer neuroscience has significantly contributed to consumer research. In  , we have reviewed and attempted to summarize more than 50 empirical articles utilizing fMRI techniques. The works summarized here have been published in consumer research journals such as the   Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science  , the   Journal of Consumer Research  , the   Journal of Marketing Research  , the   Journal of Consumer Psychology  , and the   Journal of the Association for Consumer Research  , as well as journals in fields outside consumer research, including psychology, neuroscience, and the general science. For journals outside consumer research, we have focused our review on   Cortex  ,   Journal of Neuroscience  ,   Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics, NeuroImage  ,   Neuron  ,   Psychological Science  , the   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  , and   Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience  , in which some of the earlier work on consumer neuroscience appeared and more recent work has continued to appear. For consumer research journals, the list of included works is based on research results for methodological keywords such as \u201cneuroimaging\u201d and \u201cfMRI.\u201d For journals outside consumer research, the list of included works is focused on fMRI studies generated from searching keywords such as \u201cconsumer neuroscience,\u201d \u201cneuromarketing,\u201d \u201cmarket,\u201d \u201cmarketing,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d and \u201cpurchase.\u201d Given our focus on specific journals and keywords, we acknowledge that some works related to consumer neuroscience may not be included in this review. Additionally, since our article\u2019s focus is on fMRI, we would like to note that important work has been done using other imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Nevertheless, the works included in   cover a broad range of topics relevant to consumer researchers, including theoretical domains such as information processing ( ;  ), judgment and decision making ( ;  ), and goals and motivation ( ;  ), as well as substantive domains such as advertising ( ;  ;  ), pricing ( ;  ), branding ( ,  ;  ), and packaging design ( ). The table also examines the papers\u2019 usage of meta-analyses as well as psychometrics\/behavioral data, two major data source that we recommend triangulating with the fMRI data. Taken together,   provides a summary of the status of the consumer neuroscience literature and the type of data being used, showing that over the past one and a half decades researchers have started to integrate different data forms in their investigations. \n  \nConsumer neuroscience research in marketing, consumer research, and neuroscience journals (chronological order). \n    \n\n## Approaches for the Interpretation of Consumer Neuroscience Data: Forward Versus Reverse Inference \n  \nAccording to  , neuroimaging studies take at least two major interpretative approaches. The first approach examines the neuroanatomical localization of behaviors and mental tasks, a process often referred to as   forward inference   ( ;  ). Forward inference has been adopted in consumer neuroscience to investigate the neurophysiological substrates of a wide range of consumer research concepts including, but not limited to, valuation ( ), social influence of buying decisions ( ), perception of money ( ), and consumer curiosity ( ). A typical forward inference question is this: While the concept of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for a product is not unfamiliar to consumer researchers, where is WTP encoded in the brain?   attempted to answer this interesting question by having hungry participants bid for the right to eat food. The authors pinpointed the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as encoding locations of WTP. While the forward inference approach is laudable, it does not come without limitations. One such limitation is that while forward inference may highlight that a particular consumer research concept is correlated with activation of a certain brain area, forward inference often leaves open the psychological interpretation of possible underlying processes at play. This limitation may be less problematic in research that is largely interested in brain mapping but becomes more challenging in research that also cares about underlying psychological processes. \n\nThe second major approach of neuroimaging research involves using brain activation patterns to infer psychological processes. Specifically, by building on previously established functions and\/or connectivity of specific brain regions, consumer researchers can make educated guesses as to which cognitive and emotional processes may be taking place as consumers process information or make decisions. This process is known as   reverse inference   ( ,  ). For instance, if a researcher posits that visual processing is taking place in an fMRI study because of increased activation in the occipital lobe, the researcher is reverse inferencing. \n\nReverse inference is important for consumer research (and for neuroscience in general) because it allows consumer researchers to access implicit or latent physiological processes ( ;  ). Specifically, the reverse inference approach can contribute to consumer research in at least three ways, as discussed below. \n\nThe first and most direct application of this research approach is that it allows consumer researchers to allude to underlying implicit psychological processes by observing activities of specific brain regions. This application requires a previously established link between brain regions and their functions. For instance, in studying how consumers process aesthetic package design,   recorded participants\u2019 brain activity as they viewed aesthetic (vs. standardized) product package designs using fMRI. The authors observed that when processing aesthetic (vs. standardized) package designs, participants\u2019 brains featured greater activation in the striatum, a brain area that has been associated with reward evaluations and processing ( ;  ;  ;  ), among other activations. Following a similar interpretative logic,   found that increasing the price of wine increases both reports of pleasantness as well as activity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a brain area that has widely been thought to encode pleasantness. \n\nSecond, neuroimaging can aid consumer researchers when competing theories exist to explain an observed phenomenon. Specifically, researchers have relied on established theories of brain regions\u2019 functions to determine which theory is (or theories are) supported by actual brain activation. One such paper is   seminal examination of self-control depletion. Building on a two-stage model of self-control (i.e., recognizing the need for self-control \u2192 implementing self-control), the authors examined three completing models of depletion: (1) depletion only impairs the ability to recognize the need for self-control, (2) depletion only impairs the ability to implement self-control, and (3) depletion impairs both abilities. An fMRI study demonstrated that under depletion, a brain region associated with the implementation of controlled action (i.e., the right middle frontal gyrus located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) features reduced activation, but such patterns were not found in the brain region associated with the detection of goal conflict (i.e., the anterior cingulate cortex). Therefore, the authors were able to conclude that only the implementation stage was likely to be affected by depletion ( ). \n\nThird, the reverse inference approach is also useful in distinguishing different processes, networks, or stages of processing (i.e., neurophysiological dissociation). Such studies usually involve the observation of activations in different brain functional regions and\/or networks (and occasionally also at different times) when participants undertake different cognitive tasks. For instance,   investigated whether semantic judgments of brands and humans are processed similarly. It has long been observed that consumers, marketers, and researchers alike tend to use similar if not identical words to describe both brands and people ( ;  ;  ). For instance, a brand can be \u201creliable\u201d like a person and can form relationships with humans as other humans do. This tendency naturally raises the question of whether brands and humans are processed identically or at least similarly in the human brain.   work, however, showed that this may not be the case: Processing humans was associated with the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas processing brands was associated with the left inferior prefrontal cortex, which has been found to be involved in object processing. \n\nIn summary, neuroimaging studies often take two major interpretative approaches: Using both behaviors and mental tasks to explore neurophysiological correlates and to map the brain (i.e., forward inference) and using brain activations to infer certain psychological processes (i.e., reverse inference). With reverse inference, we have further identified three ways in which reverse inference contributes to consumer research: (1) determining underlying, implicit, and unknown psychological processes; (2) determining the plausibility of enhancing and\/or completing theories; and (3) distinguishing multiple processes, networks, or stages of processing. Both approaches are of great value and are widely employed in consumer neuroscience and neuroscience in general. In the present paper, we focus on reverse inference due to its theoretical and methodological intricacies and highlight its potential issues when employed. \n\n\n## Potential Issues Associated With Reverse Inference \n  \nAlthough reverse inference is by no means an incorrect research approach   per se   ( ), neuroscientists have noticed interpretational issues associated with it ( ;  ). More specifically, when activation in a brain region of interest is not particularly selective for a specific cognitive process (i.e., when multiple cognitive processes can activate the same brain region), the validity of reverse inference can be undermined ( ,  ). \n\nFor instance, it has long been known that the anterior cingulate cortex is heavily involved in the processing of conflicting information from the environment ( ;  ;  ), so it is tempting to assume that the consumer brain is processing conflicting information when activation in this brain region is observed. However, prior literature shows that the anterior cingulate cortex is also sensitive to the gain and loss of rewards (e.g.,  ;  ). As a result, researchers cannot, without committing a logical fallacy, argue for the involvement of conflicting information based on the activation observed in the anterior cingulate cortex alone. \n\nUnfortunately, multi-functional brain regions are quite common (e.g.,  ;  ). As a result, issues associated with reverse inference are neither foreign to consumer neuroscience nor foreign to neuroscience in general. Indeed, in the recent consumer neuroscience literature, the medial prefrontal cortex has been associated with reward processing ( ;  ), pleasantness ( ), self-referential evaluation of preferences ( ), and social processes ( ;  ). While the exact three-dimensional locations of the medial prefrontal cortex may slightly vary across these investigations, they generally belong to the same anatomical brain area. Similarly, activation in the insula has been claimed to indicate negative affect status ( ), social influence ( ), and desire for rewards ( ). \n\nWhat, then, can and should consumer researchers do to address this issue? Below, we will focus on three major strategies that can mitigate potential issues inherent in reverse inference: (1) reducing false alarms via refined study design and analysis, (2) employing neuroimaging meta-analyses to estimate the extent of reverse inference, and (3) integrating neuroimaging data with psychometric assessments and data from behavioral studies to provide additional confidence in the findings. We also posit that data triangulation employing these methods may greatly enhance the validity of neuroimaging research. \n\n\n## Addressing Potential Issues Associated With Reverse Inference \n  \nTo address the potential issues associated with reverse inference, we first explain its logic. Let   COG   be the cognitive process of interest, and let   ACT   be the activation in the brain region purportedly associated with this process. The validity of reverse inference is thus given by the probability that   COG   takes place given that   ACT   is present, or, formally,   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). According to Bayes\u2019 theorem: \n\nIt should be noted that the term   COG   here is always conditioned on the specific task used in the studies. In other words, the prior probability of   P  (  C   O   G  ) in this equation should in fact be P(  C   O   G  |  T   A   S   K  ), where   TASK   stands for the task setting and design. We have omitted this term in the equation for the sake of succinctness, but we will revisit this task-relevant nature of reverse inference in later discussions. \n\nThe equation above translates the question of reverse inference into \u201cWhen the activation of specific brain regions is observed, how likely is it that the cognitive process of interest indeed took place?\u201d To be able to make any meaningful argument based on such reverse inference, consumer researchers need to estimate and, if possible, systematically increase the value of   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). This can be done in multiple ways, as summarized below. \n\n### Reducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis \n  \nActivations in a brain region that (1) is purportedly associated with a cognitive process of interest but (2) does not actually reflect the proposed cognitive are called   false alarms  , which is a major culprit of reverse inference\u2019s validity issues ( ). Mathematically, the denominator in the above equation,   P  (  A   C   T  ), is the prior probability that indicates the tendency of this brain region to become activated   by default  . If a brain region can easily become activated (i.e., if the false alarm rate is high) \u2013 because, for instance, it is involved in many different cognitive processes \u2013 then   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  )will be relevantly small because   P  (  A   C   T  ) is large, rendering reverse inference invalid. \n\nAlthough how easily a brain region can become active and in how many different functions a brain region can get involved are questions largely beyond consumer researchers\u2019 control, methods exist to control the level of   P  (  A   C   T  ). \n\nFirst, consumer researchers could design studies in such a way that the chances of false alarms are reduced. To illustrate, the term   P  (  A   C   T  ) in the equation of Bayes\u2019 Theorem can be further broken down to   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  )  P  (  C   O   G  ) +   P  (  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  )  P  (\u00ac  C   O   G  ); thus, \n\nwhere \u00ac  C   O   G   indicates that the cognitive process of interest is not present. \n\nAccording to this equation, if a brain region can be activated by a mental process different from the one of interest (i.e., the false alarm, the probability of which is captured by   P  [  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  ]), then the validity of reverse inference   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) will decrease as a result (all else being equal). Conversely, if, based on the systematic review of prior literature and study design, consumer researchers can lessen the possibility that such alternative cognitive processes take place, then the term   P  (  A   C   T  |\u00ac  C   O   G  )  P  (\u00ac  C   O   G  )] should shrink in value, and, as a result, the validity of reverse inference will increase. For instance, in a thought experiment,   discusses an experiment that infers the recognition of visual words from activation of the fusiform gyrus. Because the imagery study only involves the presentation of words, consumer researchers can reasonably rule out the competing cognitive theory of facial recognition. In this way, although the fusiform gyrus is multifunctional, the study design creates functional specificity by eliminating an alternative theory and, thus, controlling the baseline level of   P  (  A   C   T  ), which is in fact   P  (  A   C   T  |  T   A   S   K  ). Needless to say, ruling out alternative cognitive processes via design requires a good understanding of the literature on the brain region(s) of interest and depends heavily upon how much is known about the functionality of the brain region (cf.  ). \n\nAnother way to reduce false alarms is to use finer (i.e., smaller and\/or better-defined) structures for reverse inference. Smaller ROIs are more selective and, thus, more predictive of cognitive processes than larger regions ( ). In addition, instead of relying on the activation of individual brain regions, consumer researchers could use patterns of such activations to decode underlying cognitive processes, a method called multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). This method utilizes pattern recognition to identify connections between cognitive processes and neuroimaging activation patterns. Such connections can then be used to reduce false alarms, as holistic activation patterns are much more selective for specific cognitive processes than individual brain regions are ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Integrating Information From Neuroimaging Meta-Analyses \n  \nWhy can meta-analyses help validate reverse inference? To answer this question, we must first discuss two important notions that are pertinent to reverse inference: consistency and specificity ( ).   Consistency   is the extent to which brain activations replicate across studies, scanners, and labs, when certain cognitive processes are engaged. For instance, when participants see fear-inducing stimuli in a scanner, do their amygdalae tend to become activated regardless of where and in which labs they are scanned, who is scanning them, and how fear is induced in these scans? If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then the amygdala can be assumed to be consistently associated with fear. In the equation above, consistency is captured by   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  ), which is in proportion to   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). In other words, if consistency is inflated, then the evaluation of reverse inference will also be inflated, causing a validity issue. Unfortunately, in neuroimaging studies,   P  (  A   C   T  |  C   O   G  ) does tend to be inflated, because the usually small sample sizes and large numbers of tests give rise to underpowered studies and high false positive rates ( ;  ). As a result, to evaluate the validity of reverse inference, consistency must be accounted for. On the other hand,   specificity   captures whether a brain region is selective for a mental process, which is directly associated with the validity of reverse inference as discussed in section \u201cReducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis.\u201d \n\nTherefore, to estimate   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) and assess the validity of reverse inference, it is crucial to estimate consistency and specificity. However, neither feature can be acquired from a single study. Rather, one must consult a substantial number of studies to make a good estimation of consistency and specificity and, in turn, the validity of reverse inference. \n\nNeuroimaging databases, such as   ( ), attempt to provide a means to account for consistency and specificity based on prior neuroimaging literature and meta-analyses generated using the database. Such databases thus attempt to quantify the extent of reverse inference by estimating the posterior probability   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ).   claims to be an open-source, large-scale, automated synthesis of functional neuroimaging data, utilizing text-mining and meta-analytic techniques to synthesize more than 14,000 published research papers (as of June 2020) and providing probabilistic mappings between brain regions and terms. These terms describe cognitive states (e.g., \u201cpain,\u201d \u201cworking memory,\u201d or \u201cfear\u201d) and are used in the abstract of a paper, so they serve as a proxy of the mental process of interest. Based on this database and the meta-analysis provided therein, consumer researchers are able to tell whether there tends to be a non-zero association between the usages of certain terms (e.g., \u201cemotion\u201d) and the activation of a given brain region (e.g., the amygdala) in the extant literature. More importantly, the database also provides the posterior probability of a term, if the activation of a specific brain region is found (i.e., an estimated   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) based on extant literature). \n\nTo illustrate the usefulness and usage of meta-analysis, imagine that a consumer researcher is interested in how product evaluation can be influenced by the physical attractiveness of photos of human models that appear on product packages. Let us further assume after a literature review, the researcher hypothesizes that highly attractive models are more rewarding than average-looking models and thus lead to more favorable product evaluation. Since the reward valuation of physical attractiveness is associated with activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ), the researcher chooses the ventromedial prefrontal cortex as the ROI that reflects reward processing in this hypothesis. [Note, however, that in this scenario we focus on a single brain region only to make the example as simple as possible. In reality, it is always advisable to expect more than one ROI to be activated and, as a result, to (1) always include a whole brain analyses under the proper family-wise error rate (FWER)\/false discovery rate (FDR) threshold (i.e., techniques to control false positives in fMRI data analysis, see  ) and\/or (2) investigate brain regions in their activation patterns rather than in isolation, for instance employing MVPA as discussed in Section \u201cReducing False Alarms in Reverse Inference via Careful Design and Analysis\u201d]. \n\nThe researcher then sets out to test the hypothesis with fMRI, in which participants are shown a battery of product packages with images of either highly attractive models or average-looking models on them. Consistent with the hypothesis, when viewing packages with highly attractive (vs. average-looking) models, participants exhibit a brain activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in a region of interest with the center being the MNI coordinates   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216. Also consistent with the hypothesis, the BOLD signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediates the liking of the product reported by in-scanner button pressing. \n\nBased on these results, it would seem that the hypothesis is supported by the fMRI result. However, is this truly the case? Can the researcher reasonably infer reward processing from this brain activation, understanding the risks of reverse inference, especially regarding such notoriously multifunctional regions as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex? \n\nTo answer this question, the researcher needs to estimate   P  (  R   e   w   a   r   d   P   r   o   c   e   s   s   i   n   g  |  v   m   P   F   C   a   c   t   i   v   a   t   i   o   n   i   n   a   n   d   a   r   o   u   n   d  [\u22124,38,\u221216]), which indicates how much confidence the researcher can put in this reverse inference.   is designed precisely to quantify such reverse inferences. After inputting the coordinates of the peak voxel activation in  , it generates a table under the \u201cAssociations\u201d tab (see  ) based on its meta-analytical data corpus. Clearly, some terms in the table are brain regions (e.g., \u201cventromedial,\u201d \u201cvmpfc\u201d), while others are cognitive processes (e.g., \u201cterms,\u201d \u201cdecision,\u201d \u201cchoice\u201d). \n  \nMeta-analysis results generated by   (retrieved on June 26, 2020). \n  \nNot surprisingly, the term \u201creward\u201d (highlighted in  ) appears in the association table. For this term of interest, the meta-analysis first returns a   z  -score of 5.39. This z-score shows whether there exists a non-zero relationship between the term (\u201creward\u201d in this case) and the location (i.e.,   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216). The larger the z-score, the more confidence the researcher can have in claiming that this brain location is indeed associated with reward in the extant literature. Note that this z-score, however,   cannot   be used to determine the validity of the reverse inference being employed,   nor   can it be used to infer the strength of the association between the mental process (i.e., the term) and the location of the activation in the brain ( ). \n\nMore informative is the number under the \u201cposterior prob.\u201d column. This number is the estimation of   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ) and, thus, of the validity of the reverse inference. In our case, the posterior probability is 0.7 (see  ). However, what does this number mean? Note that Bayes\u2019 Theorem dictates that posterior probabilities must be calculated based on prior probabilities. In the case of  , its creators arbitrarily impose a uniform 50% prior probability on   all   terms [  P  (  C   O   G  ) = \u20040.5  for   any   C   O   G  ]. In other words,   assumes that if we take a random paper in the database, the prior probability of that paper using   any   term is exactly 50%. This is, of course, not true in reality; however, by making this assumption,   provides a threshold that applies to   all   terms, such that if the posterior probability is greater than 0.5, then the researcher can reasonably assume that the reverse inference he or she is examining has some merit at an above-chance level ( ;  ). In addition, this uniform, arbitrary 0.5 prior probability allows researchers to make quantitative comparisons across all terms, such that if a location has a greater posterior probability for a term, then this region is more preferentially associated with that term than are the terms with lower posterior probabilities. It should be noted, however, that if the arbitrary prior probability is changed to other values from 0.5, the posterior probability will also vary as a result. Therefore, the absolute value of the posterior probability does not carry much meaning   per se  , and interpretations thereof should be made only in relation to other probabilities, such as the default 0.5, or the posterior probability for a different term associated with the same voxel. \n\nTherefore, in our case, the 0.7 posterior probability means that if there is a 50\u201350 chance that a study uses the term \u201creward\u201d   a priori  , then the estimated posterior probability for the term \u201creward\u201d to be used increases to 70% after we observe the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in and around MNI coordinates   x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216. Thus, it seems that there is an above-chance likelihood that reward process is present in this hypothetical study. Please note again that one can only interpret change (i.e., 0.7 vs. the baseline 0.5) and not the absolute value. \n\nHowever, we should take care here to avoid jumping to conclusions. It is very important to note that the fact that there is a decent chance of reward processing having taken place given the observed activation does not necessarily mean that this region is   selective   for reward. Rather, other terms may also have comparable or even higher levels of posterior probability in this reported region. Indeed, if we pay close attention to other terms in  , terms such as \u201cautobiographical memory\u201d and \u201cmentalizing\u201d (both highlighted) will arise, each having a posterior probability even greater than that of \u201creward\u201d (0.84 and 0.79, respectively). Admittedly, many terms with the highest posterior probabilities in this table are reward-related (e.g., \u201creward,\u201d \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201cmoney\u201d). However, even after taking all these terms into consideration, the conclusion the researcher can draw from this meta-analysis is still inconclusive; that is, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in and around (  x   = \u22124,   y   = 38,   z   = \u221216) is preferentially (but not selectively) associated with reward. In other words, at this point in the analysis, we are still not sure if reward processing is truly happening. \n\nThus far, we have discussed what the   database tells us and, equally importantly, what it does   not   tell us (also cf.  ,  for a discussion). The most important question, however, still remains. The researcher in our hypothetical example theorizes that reward is underlying the processing of product packages with images of highly attractive (vs. average-looking) human models on them. The fMRI result seems to support this argument, and the meta-analysis suggests that there is a good chance that the researcher is on the right track. However, the researcher still cannot draw decisive conclusions, due to the existence of alternative, equally viable (at least judging from the meta-analysis) mental processes (in this case, autobiographical memory and mentalizing). So, what should the researcher do now? \n\nThis question can be partially addressed by the meta-analysis that brings up this very question. Indeed, a valuable function of meta-analysis is to identify a (limited) set of competing theories so the proposed hypothesis can be supported by eliminating other (at least major) alternatives. Needless to say, the easiest alternatives to exclude are those that are unlikely to occur under the particular study design being employed. For instance, in the design of the hypothetical study described above, autobiographical memory is very unlikely to have been involved (since there is not a memory-related task involved) and thus can be reasonably excluded. \n\nHowever, mentalizing \u2013 the process by which individuals make sense of the mental state of others or oneself \u2013 may well survive this \u201cexclusion by study design.\u201d After all, when consumers see other human beings (i.e., human models used in our hypothetical fMRI experiment), especially if they show emotions, consumers may well engage in mentalizing and, in turn, feature the well-documented activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ;  ). At this point, the researcher needs to think above and beyond the meta-analysis. One possible solution, for example, is to acquire the activation pattern of mentalizing; if this pattern is inconsistent with the actual results, then it is very likely that mentalizing may not have taken place. In this case, mentalizing involves not only the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex but also activity in the precuneus and\/or the temporoparietal junction, which often accompany ventromedial activations. Thus, if the researcher fails to find meaningful activations in these additional regions, mentalizing may not have been engaged in the study. Needless to say, the researcher should turn to extant literature to identify such patterns; however, another newly launched meta-analysis database,  , may also greatly assist in this process, in that it helps researchers predict which brain regions are likely to become activated given designated cognitive processes. Moreover, pattern-based activation can prove useful even if mentalizing does take place. For instance, if reward processing indeed occurs, it may not only involve the ventromedial prefrontal cortex but also trigger the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum. If the researcher can find activity in these regions that are also involved in reward processing, it becomes more evident that reward is taking place, even in the presence of mentalizing. \n\nAlthough meta-analyses can shed important light upon the validity of reverse inference, it is not without limitations. Other than the information meta-analysis cannot yield, which we already discussed in Section \u201cIntegrating Information from Neuroimaging Meta-Analyses,\u201d there exist other factors that limit the usefulness of meta-analyses. \n\nFirst, when the term related to the cognitive process of interest has been rarely examined in the literature, the database will provide little information to the researcher. For instance, consumer researchers interested in personal control may recognize the scantiness of neuroimaging studies investigating perceived control and loss thereof, despite the richness of non-imaging work, which has been conducted mostly on non-human animals (e.g.,  ;  ,  ). \n\nSecond, when a term is used inconsistently in the literature, the usefulness of meta-analysis is also limited. For instance, in the literature, the term \u201ccontrol\u201d not only is used to refer to \u201cpersonal control\u201d but also is found in works involving self-control, motor control, executive control, and even the control condition in experimental studies. These terms are not distinguishable in the database due to the limitation of text-recognition tools, thus rendering meta-analyses on such terms virtually uninformative. \n\nThird, meta-analysis databases like   cannot capture nuances across studies and designs. Such situations may introduce noise to meta-analyses and thus undermine the usefulness of their results, except in the case of well-defined and consistently-used cognitive processes and experimental procedures ( ). \n\nFor instance, meta-analysis databases may not be able to distinguish between \u201cperceptual curiosity\u201d and \u201cepistemic curiosity,\u201d as the terms tend to be aggregated together, despite their conceptual and neurophysiological distinctions in the literature on curiosity ( ;  ;  ;  ). To make matters worse, there are too few neuroimaging studies on curiosity to provide sufficient statistical power for the meta-analysis, if such terms exist in the database at all. Moreover, the inconsistent study procedures introduce noise to the database. Thus, if a researcher hypothesizes perceptual (but not epistemic) curiosity as the cognitive process underlying a certain consumer behavior, meta-analysis might not be able to provide much useful insight. In the following section, we argue that behavioral data can prove useful in addressing these concerns. \n\nIn addition, another database,   ( ), has recently been made publicly available.  This new database complements the previously discussed databases in important ways, which we discuss below. An issue with the traditional databases is that the results they generate are largely based on decontextualized, aggregated data and arbitrary thresholding. Specifically, such databases rely on automated text-analysis algorithms and scripts to analyze and document the neuroscience concepts (in the form of \u201cterms\u201d) included in a sizable corpus of literature with considerable statistic power. However, to investigate these neuroscience concepts, the original research papers included in the corpus may take different approaches, employ different designs, and use different terms. Due to current limitations of text-mining techniques, traditional databases are unable to capture such task-related information, nuances across studies and designs, and idiosyncratic usages of the same terms. This situation can prove problematic, because the output of such analysis can suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and thus can be difficult to control and interpret, except in the case of well-defined concepts and\/or highly standardized procedures ( ).  , on the other hand, attempts to employ a different approach. Specifically,   begins with keywords (e.g., psychological processes, neuropsychological conditions, and anatomy) and uses these terms to predict what brain regions are likely to become activated if proposed psychological processes are engaged. The model this database utilizes can produce accurate and usable predictions of ROIs even for less common terms, terms that are named inconsistently in neuroscience vocabulary, or sets of terms that have not been studied together previously. \n\n\n### Integrating Psychometric and Behavioral Data \n  \nAlthough many researchers turn to neuroimaging techniques to discover mental processes precisely because of behavioral studies\u2019 limitations, psychometric and behavioral data are useful in neuroimaging studies in many ways. To begin with, in relation to our discussions on meta-analyses, psychometric and behavioral data can prove helpful in compensating the shortcomings of meta-analyses, as they can provide a better-calibrated, task-relevant environment to investigate psychological processes of interest. In the aforementioned case of curiosity, for instance, extant literature provides rich behavioral manipulations to introduce perceptual vs. epistemic curiosity (e.g.,  ), and the researcher can thus conduct behavioral experiments to observe whether perceptual (but not epistemic) curiosity produces the consumer behavior in question. If so, such studies can provide more evidence to complement the fMRI data. \n\nEven when meta-analyses can be employed without the issues discussed in the previous section, psychometric and behavioral data can still prove helpful to reverse inference studies by provide additional evidence that the proposed cognitive process is indeed implicated in the phenomenon being studied. Mathematically, doing so increases   P  (  C   O   G  ) and in turn   P  (  C   O   G  |  A   C   T  ). For instance,   investigate the consumer responsiveness to the \u201cmarketing placebo effects\u201d (MPE; the effect by which consumption experience and subsequent behavior are influenced by marketing-based expectancy such price, quality beliefs, etc.). The authors provide a comprehensive account of the cognitive processes that can influence MPE: reward responsiveness, cognitive top-down processing, and somatosensory bottom-up processing. In an MRI study, the gray matter volume of brain regions associated with these cognitive processes is found to be predictive of the MPE effect. To provide further support for this theoretical account, the authors further conducted a study demonstrating that personality traits related to these cognitive processes are also predictive of MPE, as are gray matter volume measures, thus fostering extra confidence in the proposed processes. \n\nNote that for triangulation purposes, the behavioral data do not need to be \u201cpurely behavioral\u201d (i.e., collected from separate studies that do not feature neuroimaging elements at all). Rather, the collection of psychometric and behavioral data can either be part of the original fMRI study and\/or collected in separate studies. \n\nFor instance, imagine a study investigating how food print ads drive consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase. To explore the cognitive process underlying food ads, suppose the researcher shows hungry participants multiple food ad images in the scanner as they report how much they want to purchase the food advertised. Let us further assume that the researcher finds that more successful ads are associated with (1) a neural network associated with reward and impulse (which might include, say, the nucleus accumbens, orbital prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, etc.) and (2) importantly, reduced activation in the medial prefrontal gyrus, a region associated with inhibition behavior (e.g.,  ). Based on this pattern, our hypothetical researcher speculates that more successful food ads might be associated with greater inhibition\/control failure and, in turn, higher willingness to purchase. (Here again, we caution our readers that the theorization and selection of ROIs herein are overly simplified for the sake of clarity and succinctness). \n\nThis theorizing is clearly an example of potentially problematic reverse inferences. How, then, can behavioral data help the researcher with this proposed process? Of course, the aforementioned \u201cpurely behavioral\u201d studies can be conducted, wherein the researcher shows that depleted participants exhibit greater willingness to purchase to the same food ad than non-depleted participants do, thus demonstrating the involvement of control process. Alternatively, the researcher could show that people\u2019s acceptance of the same food ad is a function of their trait self-control. However, the researchers can also collect behavioral data and combine them with neuroimaging data collected in either the existing or a new study to provide support for the proposed hypothesis. \n\nFor instance, if inhibition\/control indeed plays a role in the acceptance of food ads, the aggregated activation in related brain regions acquired from a group as small as the participants scanned may be predictive of the effectiveness of the ads in the real world on a market or population level (i.e., neuroforecasting,  ). Such \u201crelated brain regions\u201d may be the medial prefrontal gyrus found in the existing hypothetical study or may involve a more extensive inhibitory network established by the literature. Similarly, the researcher could also run a structural scan to see whether the cortical thickness of these brain regions is predictive of individual participants\u2019 acceptance of the ads (e.g., rating, choice, etc.). Furthermore, the researcher can even use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt the function in these brain regions (if they are relative shallow) or recruit participants with lesions in these areas and obverse how these participants react to the ads in comparison to control participants. In all these approaches, behavioral data are combined with brain data to shed light upon the underlying cognitive processes \u2013 in this case, inhibition and control. \n\nAs shown above, psychometric and behavioral data can be triangulated with brain data in a very flexible manner and can provide interesting and useful insights to researchers in many ways. Based on the specific issues they are investigating, the nature of the existing design and data, and the technology and resources available to them, researchers can select approaches to behavioral data to fit their needs. \n\n\n### Summary: The Importance of Triangulation \n  \nIn summary, in consumer neuroscience, researchers can address the validity issue of reverse inference by (1) refining the neuroimaging study design and analysis to reduce false alarms, (2) utilizing neuroimaging databases and the meta-analysis data therein to quantify the extent of reverse inference, and (3) using psychometric and behavioral data to provide additional process evidence. \n\nIn this paper, we advocate not the isolated employment but the triangulation of these methods. Such triangulation can enable each method to compensate for the others\u2019 shortcomings and disadvantages, thus providing synergy toward improved overall validity. As discussed earlier, notwithstanding their unique advantages, each of these methods suffers from certain shortcomings: fMRI studies can investigate hidden mental processes but are potentially vulnerable to reverse inference issues; neuroimaging meta-analysis can assist researchers in quantifying reverse inference, but its usability can be limited and its analysis may not necessarily be conclusive; and behavioral data are flexible and can be well calibrated to the stimuli and procedures but may not be able to address the mental process of interest in a direct manner (the very reason researchers turn to neuroimaging in the first place). \n\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of each method is important, as the cons serve as a starting point to identify the potential validity issues with one\u2019s data, while the pros help researchers understand what data triangulations should be employed to address these issues. Indeed, this is precisely what the literature on Multitrait-Multimethod Matrices (MTMM,  ;  ) suggests: that is, a single method may not be enough to distinguish the cognitive process of interest from unsubstantial, random-method variance and noise and, instead, multiple methods taking different angles can possibly redress single-method concern effectively. \n\nTherefore, despite the increased time, effort, and expertise needed to adopt a multi-method approach, we still believe that the triangulation approach we have proposed herein should be considered by consumer neuroscience researchers. Specifically, for neuroimaging studies in consumer neuroscience, we believe the researcher should always (1) carefully refine the design of the fMRI study and (2) utilize meta-analyses (of course, sometimes the database is not usable for certain keywords and designs, but this is not known to the researcher until they have utilized the database). On the other hand, we believe that the researcher should base their decision of whether to include (3) psychometric and behavioral data, as well as what to include, on the specific issue they are facing. If, for example, the researcher makes a claim about certain mental cognitive processes based on brain activation, but the subsequent study design and meta-analysis cannot rule out competing theories and provide conclusive judgments, we would then recommend that psychometric and behavioral data be included. However, if it is already well-established in the behavioral literature that treatment X (e.g., seeing a picture of a snake) will cause mental activity M (e.g., fear) in the population of interest, and if, with due caution and prudence, the researcher can reasonably believe there is no good reason why this causal link would disappear in the scanner, then perhaps in such a case the researcher does not need to reinvent the wheel. Therefore, much as we applaud the merit of psychometric and behavioral data in general and believe they are beneficial most of the time, as a general principle we encourage researchers to include meaningful psychometric and behavioral data that address existing issues stemming from their particular research question and design, instead of triangulating for the sake of triangulating. \n\nIn addition to the hypothetical examples we used in previous sections, real-world examples of triangulation can also be found in the extant literature in consumer neuroscience. Regarding the works we summarized in  , in Section \u201cIntegrating Psychometric and Behavioral Data,\u201d we already discussed how   triangulated anatomical neuroimaging data with psychometric measures to explore the marketing placebo effect, and we would like to note that in this work the authors also utilize the NeuroSynth meta-analytical tool in support of their conclusions. Similarly, in  , an fMRI study demonstrates that brand betrayal and brand satisfaction involve different brain areas. This result is triangulated with both psychometric measures and the NeuroSynth database. The authors were able to pinpoint a number of aspects on which brand dissatisfaction is differentiated from brand betrayal, including prior relationship with the brand, anger, and rumination. Furthermore, by combining fMRI, individual-level data and marketing-level behavioral data,   found that nucleus accumbens activity not only predicts individual choices to fund in crowdfunding but also market-level funding outcome. The authors also examined the role sensory processes play in the identified pattern, and NeuroSynth was employed to predefine the volumes of interest (VOIs). \n\n\n\n## Future Directions in Consumer Neuroscience \n  \nIn addition to data triangulation, other practices can also improve the validity of individual studies and consumer neuroscience. Although a thorough discussion of these practices would be outside the scope of this paper, we would still like to take this opportunity to briefly advocate some of these practices for future studies in the field. \n\n### Toward a Quantification of Triangulation \n  \nAs discussed in Section \u201cSummary: The Importance of Triangulation,\u201d the notion of data triangulation proposed in this paper is consistent with that of the Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix (MTMM,  ). The MTMM provides useful information that can benefit fMRI studies in three ways. First, the MTMM provides estimations of reliability of each measure, which could potentially help address the issue that fMRI measures tend to suffer from poor overall reliability ( ). Second, the MTMM provides assessment of convergent validity: if a concept (e.g., a mental process) is measured through multiple methods, the measures should be strongly correlated. Third, the MTMM also helps researchers to establish discriminant (or divergent) of measures, such that measures for different constructs should not be correlated ( ). \n\nTherefore, the MTMM would be a good tool to evaluate how well the triangulation improves the validity. The challenge is, however, how to directly compare the vastly different methods (e.g., behavioral data of distinct nature and neuroimaging data) on the MTMM. Although the analysis above already lays out the means in which triangulation can help improve the validity of fMRI studies, quantifying such improvement would provide the proposed triangulation with even more solid footing. Thus, we advocate the quantification of the proposed triangulation as a direction for future research. \n\n\n### Toward an Interpretable Consumer Neuroscience \n  \nRecent years have witnessed an increase in the important discussion regarding how to promote openness and transparency of research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In solidarity with the fields\u2019 joint effort toward a more precise and interpretable discipline, we also take the opportunity to advocate these practices in consumer neuroscience. For example, we suggest that consumer researchers could report information regarding experimental design, image acquisition, preprocessing, statistical modeling and statistical inferences, as well as result tables, which could be provided in a web appendix alongside the main paper. Some guidelines and checklists are provided, for instance, by   and in the appendix to  . These practices may be helpful to make research reports more interpretable. \n\nAnother laudable practice is data sharing. This practice is more than just academic integrity, but also improves the validity of data analysis. In a recent paper published in   Nature   ( ), 70 independent teams of researchers were asked to analyze the same dataset. Since no two teams employed the same workflow of analysis, this flexibility in data analysis creates a considerable variation in the results of hypotheses testing. When the results from teams are aggregated, however, they show a significant convergence on activated regions. Thus, for better cross-validation, consumer neuroscientists may want to consider sharing data, which can be done with dedicated online repositories such as   ( ),   ( ), and  . Furthermore, we encourage consumer researchers to share the workflow by which the data were analyzed, and report (if applicable) the code they used to analyze scan data on online platforms such as   to further promote transparency, openness, and cross-validation. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nConsumer neuroscience may hold valuable insights for the advancement of consumer research, with perhaps the most intriguing of these being its potential to (1) reveal hidden cognitive and emotional processes that have been inaccessible to traditional research methods and (2) to confirm physiological and psychological processes underlying consumer behavior. Indeed, over the years, consumer researchers have been employing fMRI, along with other neuroimaging techniques, in an attempt to open the black boxes of consumer experience, motivation, decision-making, and so on. Needless to say, fMRI has shed new light upon our understanding of consumer behavior, and we fully acknowledge the important contributions made by the field. That being said, as we pointed out earlier, many studies\u2019 reliance on reverse inference may render them vulnerable to validity issues. To promote the validity of individual neuroimaging studies as well as consumer neuroscience as a field, in this paper we advocate for the triangulation of neuroimaging data with meta-analyses as well as psychometric and behavioral data. We believe these research practices may substantially increase the conclusions we can draw from fMRI data. Therefore, we encourage the employment of data triangulation in consumer neuroscience research. Lastly, we take this opportunity to offer our special acknowledgment to the intensive methodological discussions and disputes taking place in our parent disciplines, such as cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging, as this paper draws largely upon their lessons and wisdom. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions generated for this study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nCC conducted the review on extant literature and the analysis on reverse inference in the frontend with the consent of MR.

{"text":"Deming, Philip and Koenigs, Michael\nTransl Psychiatry, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nFunctional neural correlates of psychopathy: a meta-analysis of MRI data\n\n# Keywords\n\nBiomarkers\nPsychiatric disorders\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nNeuroimaging studies over the last two decades have begun to specify the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy, a personality disorder that is strongly related to criminal offending and recidivism. Despite the accumulation of neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, a clear and comprehensive picture of the disorder\u2019s neural correlates has yet to emerge. The current study is a meta-analysis of functional MRI studies of psychopathy. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify consistent findings across 25 studies (460 foci) of task-related brain activity. Psychopathy was associated with increased task-related activity predominantly in midline cortical regions overlapping with the default mode network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and precuneus) as well as medial temporal lobe (including amygdala). Psychopathy was related to decreased task-related activity in a region of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex overlapping with the salience network. These findings challenge predominant theories of amygdala hypoactivity and highlight the potential role of hyperactivity in medial default mode network regions and hypoactivity in a key node of the salience network during task performance in psychopathy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTwo decades of neuroimaging studies have begun to specify the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy, a personality disorder characterized by callous and impulsive antisocial behavior. Present in approximately one-quarter of adult male prison inmates , psychopathy is a significant predictor of violent reoffending  that costs the United States an estimated $460 billion per year , making psychopathy one of the most costly mental health disorders. Despite the accumulation of neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, a clear and comprehensive picture of the disorder\u2019s neural correlates has yet to emerge. \n\nSpecifying the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy could have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, as well as for the criminal justice system. Clinically, the identification of neural correlates of psychopathy could inform the development of biomarkers for vulnerability and early detection, anatomical targets for intervention, and predictors of treatment response. Furthermore, given the relatively high prevalence of psychopathy among criminal offenders and its predictive utility for violent reoffending, there is growing interest in the relevance of neuroimaging data for predicting future offense , as well as for influencing sentencing of psychopathic offenders . Hence, neuroimaging research on psychopathy has multiple potential applications. \n\nNeuroimaging studies to date have generally tested specific theoretical models of neurobiological dysfunction in psychopathy. In fact, we identified 68 neuroimaging studies of psychopathy that used hypothesis-driven, region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, compared with 50 studies that used whole-brain analyses. The amygdala, in particular, is the focus of a robust literature on impaired fear and threat processing in psychopathy . Psychopathic individuals show diminished amygdala activity during aversive conditioning , facial emotion recognition , and moral judgment . Amygdala volume reductions  and surface deformations  have also been observed in psychopathic individuals. A region densely interconnected with the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), has also received substantial attention in the psychopathy literature . Psychopathic individuals show reduced vmPFC activity during moral judgment  and reduced vmPFC volume . Amygdala and vmPFC have been identified by one theoretical perspective as the primary circuit of dysfunction in psychopathy . According to this perspective, deficits in these regions underlie psychopathic individuals\u2019 failure to pair negative and positive outcomes with their own actions. \n\nAnother perspective expands the scope of neural dysfunction beyond amygdala and vmPFC to the paralimbic cortex more broadly, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal pole, insula, and parahippocampal gyrus . Indeed, psychopathy has been associated with structural  and functional  abnormalities in these regions. Moreover, deficits similar to those of psychopathic individuals have been observed in patients with lesions in paralimbic regions, including vmPFC , ACC , and amygdala . \n\nPsychopathic individuals also display heightened sensitivity to rewards and sensation-seeking behavior , which has been linked to increased volume and activity in the striatum . Psychopathic individuals show enlargements in several subregions of the striatum, including caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens , and increased activity of nucleus accumbens during reward anticipation . Increased volume and activity in the striatum may thus contribute to psychopathic individuals\u2019 impulsive, sensation-seeking behavior. Although the studies outlined above highlight the importance of striatum and paralimbic regions\u2014particularly amygdala and vmPFC\u2014in psychopathy, reliance on primarily hypothesis-driven analyses may limit the identification of other relevant brain circuits. \n\nA recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies aimed to specify the neural correlates of psychopathy using a whole-brain approach . Psychopathy was negatively related to task-based activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and right amygdala, and positively related to activity in bilateral anterior insula. However, methodological characteristics of this recent meta-analysis limit the interpretations that can be drawn from these findings. First, the prior study included the effects of the distinct subsets of psychopathic traits in their meta-analysis of total psychopathy. Conflating subsets of psychopathic traits with the disorder itself could lead to the interpretation that a particular brain region or network is related to psychopathy overall, when in fact it is related to a restricted subset of traits. In addition, their meta-analytic method, activation likelihood estimate (ALE), uses coordinates of individual activation peaks as the unit of analysis, thereby potentially allowing a small number of studies reporting relatively high numbers of activation coordinates to drive the meta-analytic results . By contrast, the current state-of-the-art meta-analytic approach, multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA), uses the contrast map from an individual study as the unit of analysis and weighs study quality and sample size, allowing for greater generalization of findings . \n\nThus, the purpose of the current study is to use MKDA to identify consistent relationships between psychopathy and neural activity across a variety of tasks. Based on the previous findings reviewed above, psychopathy was predicted to be related to decreased activity in amygdala, vmPFC, ACC, PCC, and insula, and to increased activity in the striatum. The current study originally had three additional goals: (1) to identify structural neural correlates of psychopathy, (2) to identify neural correlates of two well-established subsets of psychopathic traits, and (3) to determine whether dysfunctional neural activity in psychopathy varies by task. However, an insufficient number of studies contributed to each of the models addressing these three goals. We present preliminary results from these models in the Supplementary Materials (Tables  \u2013 ), and focus our discussion on the functional neural correlates of psychopathy across tasks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and coding \n  \nWe conducted a forward literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, and a backward literature search in the reference sections of relevant papers. The following search terms were used in the forward literature search: psychopathy, psychopathic, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and neuroimaging. Studies published prior to December 31, 2019 were included based on the following criteria: (1) reported peak coordinates in Talairach  or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space, (2) used whole-brain analyses, (3) sampled only participants aged 18 and older, (4) reported group statistics rather than single-case results, and (5) compared brain activity with a measure of psychopathy. The results from group comparisons (e.g., psychopaths vs. controls) and continuous analyses (i.e., variability across a range of psychopathy scores) were included. The resulting dataset included 460 foci from 87 contrasts in 25 studies of task-based functional activity (Table  ). Figure   displays the number of studies excluded at each stage of the literature search.   \nSummary of studies included in the functional meta-analysis for total psychopathy. \n  \n PCL-R   psychopathy checklist-revised ;   PPI-R   psychopathic personality inventory-revised ;   PSPS   primary and secondary psychopathy scales ;   SRP-SF   self-report psychopathy short form . \n     Flowchart of the literature search process.  \nAfter a full-text review, studies were excluded for using region of interest (ROI) rather than whole-brain analyses (68 studies), examining neural measures other than task-based neural activity (21 studies), summarizing prior literature rather than reporting new findings (18 studies), not reporting peak coordinates of findings related to total psychopathy (15 studies), grouping impulsive, non-psychopathic participants with psychopathic participants (1 study), excluding non-psychopathic participants from a continuous analysis of psychopathy (1 study), and reporting single-case results (1 study). \n  \n\nWe ensured that included contrasts were coded such that \u201cpositive\u201d activation indicated greater activity associated with the cognitive function of interest in each study. For example, contrasts from studies examining facial emotion processing were coded as fear faces\u2009>\u2009neutral faces , and contrasts from studies examining moral judgment were coded as moral\u2009>\u2009non-moral . Each reported coordinate was coded as relating positively or negatively to total psychopathy. Accuracy of the foci and corresponding information was verified by a second coder. \n\nWe determined that models with at least 15 included studies would achieve sufficient power in MKDA. Although no published standards exist for the number of included studies required for MKDA, there is evidence that 17\u201320 experiments are sufficient for another meta-analytic approach (ALE) . Given the statistical advantages of MKDA, we used a threshold of 15 studies. See Tables  \u2013  for preliminary results from models that did not meet this threshold. \n\n\n### Multilevel kernel density analysis \n  \nAnalyses were conducted using the MKDA toolbox in SPM12 . Foci in Talairach space were converted to MNI space . Binary indicator maps for each contrast were created by convolving peak foci using a 10-mm spherical kernel, with voxels related to psychopathy assigned a value of 1. Next, each indicator map was weighted by the square root of the study\u2019s sample size, and the weighted average of the indicator maps was computed. The resulting density maps represented the proportion of studies showing psychopathy relationships within 10\u2009mm. Finally, statistical thresholding was determined via 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results were considered significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 using height-based criteria or cluster extent-based criteria. Images for the figures were generated in AFNI (16.0) . Individual models were run for positive and negative relationships with total psychopathy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAcross all functional studies, total psychopathy was negatively related to neural activity in dorsal ACC (Fig.   and Table  ). In contrast, total psychopathy was positively related to neural activity in a large, bilateral portion of medial parietal and occipital cortex (including PCC and precuneus), bilateral dmPFC, right inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior orbitofrontal cortex, right medial temporal cortex (including amygdala), right hippocampus, and right parahippocampal gyrus (Fig.   and Table  ).    Consistent relationships between total psychopathy scores and brain function during experimental tasks.  \nMedial views depict the location of the coronal slice. \n    \nSignificant associations between brain function and psychopathy. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThrough a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, we identified several reliable neural correlates of psychopathy. We discuss three main conclusions from these results. For two of the main conclusions, we draw on a body of literature that has identified three intrinsic, large-scale networks that serve core cognitive functions : the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). Whereas DMN increases activity during self-referential processing and decreases activity during externally focused, non-self-referential tasks , FPN increases activity during cognitively demanding, externally focused tasks . There is evidence that SN, which is particularly important for detecting salient external stimuli, is responsible for switching between the two anticorrelated networks, DMN and FPN . Our findings suggest that psychopathy is related to dysfunction within DMN and SN across a variety of tasks. \n\nFirst, we note the considerable overlap between the areas of psychopathy-related positive activity and the DMN, particularly in dmPFC and PCC\/precuneus (Fig.  ). One interpretation, previously outlined by Freeman et al. , is that psychopathic individuals fail to deactivate these midline DMN regions during externally focused tasks. Such a failure could result in increased competition between DMN and externally oriented attention networks (such as FPN), disrupt the shift of attention to the external task, and lead to corresponding performance deficits . However, because the current meta-analytic evidence does not directly corroborate this interpretation, future studies are warranted to clarify whether overactivity within midline DMN regions in psychopathy reflects less task-associated deactivation or greater task-associated activation. Findings of reduced deactivation in DMN regions may align with theories that highlight attention deficits in psychopathy , although future studies could investigate whether dysfunction in networks involved in allocating attention to cognitively demanding tasks, such as FPN or SN, is more closely associated with psychopathic individuals\u2019 attention deficits. In psychopathy, PCC\/precuneus is not only overactive across a variety of tasks, but also less functionally and structurally connected to other DMN regions, including dmPFC  and vmPFC , and to a region of FPN .    Large-scale networks and regions associated with psychopathy.  \n a   Overlap between default mode network (DMN) and regions of hyperactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks.   b   Overlap between salience network (SN) and regions of hypoactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks. A functional connectivity-based atlas was used to display canonical DMN and SN regions . \n  \n\nSecond, as predicted, psychopathy was related to reduced dorsal ACC activity across a variety of tasks. Research in healthy humans and animal populations has implicated the dorsal ACC in a number of processes, including experiencing negative affect and pain, cognitive control , and linking task context to strategy . As a key SN node (Fig.  ), the dorsal ACC, along with insula, is neuroanatomically situated to send rapid signals deactivating DMN and activating FPN . Indeed, there is evidence that SN functions at the top of a hierarchy that includes DMN and FPN, modulating the two anticorrelated networks via inhibitory connections to DMN and excitatory connections to FPN . Thus, one interpretation of reduced dorsal ACC activity in psychopathy, in combination with increased DMN activity, is that this SN node fails to properly deactivate DMN, leading to competition between attentional resources while psychopathic individuals are engaged in an externally oriented task. While speculative, the hypothesis of reduced SN influence on DMN activity could be tested via methods such as Granger causality  or dynamic causal modeling . Prior analyses of resting-state functional connectivity lend initial corroborating evidence of altered dynamics between the three networks: dorsal ACC (of the SN) and precuneus (of the DMN) are less functionally connected to the right intraparietal sulcus (of the FPN) in psychopathic offenders . \n\nNotably, some researchers have argued that common dysfunction within and between these intrinsic networks (DMN, FPN, and SN) underlies a range of psychopathology . For example, a diminished modulating effect of SN on DMN and FPN has been observed in patients with schizophrenia  and elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment . However, disorders may be distinguished by unique dysfunction in specific nodes of these core networks (e.g., hyperactive subgenual ACC in depression) . Further inquiry is necessary to establish whether hyperactivity in medial DMN nodes and underactivity in SN is unique to psychopathy or shared among other disorders. \n\nThird, we found overall increased levels of amygdala activity associated with psychopathy. Contrary to previous ROI-based studies, we observed no evidence of decreased amygdala activity across a variety of tasks. (Even preliminary analyses of socioemotional processing, e.g., facial emotion processing in Table  , failed to yield evidence of decreased amygdala activity.) This finding challenges predominant views in the field, which identify amygdala hypoactivity as a key neural deficit in psychopathy . Further research is thus necessary to more thoroughly characterize amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy, and the following considerations may guide those studies. First, the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure, with distinct subnuclei that subserve different functions and interact with different brain networks . Psychopathy may be linked to hyperactivity in specific amygdala subnuclei and hypoactivity in others, a possibility that has already been raised by one theoretical perspective . Indeed, several studies have found that amygdala relationships with psychopathy vary by subnucleus . Second, an emerging view proposes that, in healthy individuals, the amygdala may switch its affective mode (i.e., positive or negative, appetitive or avoidant) across situations . This raises the possibility that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy varies by context. At a minimum, the present results suggest that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy is more complex than simply reduced activation resulting in diminished fear conditioning. Future studies should examine whether altered modules (i.e., amygdala subnuclei) or modes account for this complexity. \n\nNo findings from the previous neuroimaging meta-analysis of psychopathy were replicated by the current meta-analysis . Prior findings of consistent hyperactivation in the fronto-insular cortex and hypoactivation in bilateral dlPFC, dmPFC, and right amygdala were not corroborated by our models. In fact, two findings diametrically oppose those of the previous meta-analysis: dmPFC and right amygdala were hyperactive in the current meta-analysis, but hypoactive in the previous study. Though unexpected, the differences in results could be at least partly attributed to methodological differences (i.e., study inclusion criteria, contrast selections, and meta-analytic methods), as detailed in the introduction of this paper. \n\nA primary limitation of the present meta-analysis is the exclusion of studies that employed ROI analyses, necessitated by MKDA\u2019s assumption that all included studies explored the same space (in this case, the whole brain). As a result, the present meta-analytic results do not represent the whole of the neuroimaging literature on psychopathy. This limitation could be overcome through the use of image-based meta-analysis, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods . Image-based meta-analysis requires the compilation of full statistical maps from each study to assess the overall effect sizes at each voxel. Although this method would present significant challenges, its results would offer a more complete picture of the underlying neurobiology of psychopathy. Further, the meta-analysis did not control for potential sample overlap between studies, nor did it consider separately the results from categorical or continuous analyses. While this meta-analysis included studies of community samples, which may feature relatively low levels of psychopathy, the results were largely unchanged when excluding these studies (Table  ). Last, the present results offer insights into aberrant neural activity, but no evidence regarding connectivity within networks, or how information is represented within specific brain regions in psychopathy. Previous studies have investigated the former , and machine-learning studies could address the latter. \n\nIn sum, these results associate psychopathy with neural abnormalities concentrated primarily in medial prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Crucially, no single current neurobiological theory of psychopathy accounts for the observed functional abnormalities, which include multiple cortical and subcortical regions. Consistent amygdala hyperactivity, observed here, challenges predominant views in the field that amygdala hypoactivity underlies psychopathy. A more complex characterization of amygdala function in psychopathy is necessary to account for previously observed hypoactivity and currently observed hyperactivity. Moreover, the present results highlight two intrinsic networks in which task-based activity is altered in psychopathy. Characterizing the dynamic interactions of these networks in future studies could potentially further illuminate a core neurobiological deficit of the disorder. The present meta-analysis thus provides novel insight into the neural correlates of psychopathy. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7203015,"text_md5":"f11b38423ef9fdd0d5546842d7483714","field_positions":{"authors":[0,35],"journal":[36,53],"publication_year":[55,59],"title":[70,142],"keywords":[156,189],"abstract":[202,1453],"body":[1462,22424]},"batch":3,"pmid":32376864,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-020-0816-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7203015","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7203015"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7203015\">7203015<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7203015  Functional neural correlates of psychopathy: a meta-analysis of MRI data"}

Among the range of imaging methods, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unique in its applicability to studying both structure and function. Thus we additionally performed meta-analyses of MRI results to examine 1) the issue of anatomical variability and consistency for functional MRI (fMRI) findings, 2) the analogous issue of anatomical consistency for white-matter findings, and 3) the importance of accounting for the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. As we discuss, the human neuroimaging literature consists of both small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points that have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Our fMRI meta-analysis demonstrates a frontal vulnerability to mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal in prefrontal cortex compared to controls. This vulnerability is further highlighted by examining the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy, in which we show a strong anterior-to-posterior gradient (with anterior regions being more frequently reported in mTBI). Our final DTI meta-analysis examines a debated topic arising from inconsistent anisotropy findings across studies. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. Thus, this review and set of meta-analyses demonstrate several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. Based on the complexity of mTBI, however, much more work in this area is required to characterize injury mechanisms and recovery factors and to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for diagnosis. \n   Highlights  \n  \nmTBI neuroimaging literature review and meta-analyses of fMRI and DTI. \n  \nfMRI meta-analysis revealed differences between mTBI and controls in 13 regions. \n  \nmTBI anisotropy findings are statistically more frequently reported in anterior regions. \n  \nAnisotropy is elevated in acute mTBI, but depressed in chronic mTBI. \n  \nWe hypothesize a statistical interaction between anisotropy, cognitive score, and time. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTwo important points about today's neuroimaging clinical standard of care of mTBI may be surprising. First, even though MRI is a premier modality for imaging the brain, when used in conventional clinical modes (e.g. T2- and T1-weighted structural scans) it adds little to clinical diagnoses beyond what is provided by CT (computed tomography). Thus CTs, which are faster and more cost-effective ( ), are routinely used by the emergency department, while MRIs, which do not pose a health risk from repeated ionizing radiation exposure, are virtually never utilized for mTBIs. Second, imaging is not used to diagnose mTBI itself, but to test for hematomas as well as to rule out head injury complications from more severe trauma. Various guidelines for diagnosing mTBI exist, most of which rely on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ( ) and details of the injury (such as self and witness reported descriptions of the accident, loss of consciousness, and evaluation of sustained trauma) ( ). The GCS assesses motor, verbal and eye responses; while there is some variability in the categories, a GCS from 13 to 15 is often designated as mild TBI, 8 or below is considered severe, and 9 to 12 is considered a moderate TBI ( ). Ultimately, the diagnosis of TBI and its severity is made by a clinician. Approximately 1.4\u00a0million Americans receive TBI ( ), with most of these categorized as mTBIs ( ). \n\nAlthough mTBI has long been considered a noncritical injury, serious short and long term effects have been documented. Additionally, there is broad acceptance that multiple mTBIs can have serious long-term consequences ( ). There are two common conjectures regarding the etiology of mTBI. The first is that the frontal and anterior cortices are vulnerable to neural contusion ( ). The second is that linear and rotational forces act on axon bundles, leading to axonal injury ( ). After initial injury, secondary mechanisms elicit biochemical, metabolic, and cellular changes in the time frame of minutes, days and months ( ). Within the first fifteen minute post-injury, there is an extreme dip in neuropsychological performance ( ) and deficits can often linger for a week or longer ( ). The definition of the acute time frame varies across publications and some studies report acute periods of up to 1\u00a0month post-injury ( ). Our study uses the term acute mTBI up to two weeks post-injury. Using the term acute or \u201csemi-acute\u201d for time periods up to 2\u00a0weeks post-injury is common in the literature ( ). Most mTBI patients recover, but a substantial minority have persistent disabling problems ( ), known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Although criteria have been established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV ( ) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), PCS is difficult to diagnose and its symptoms are nonspecific. PCS also manifests symptoms similar to other disorders such as major depression ( ), chronic pain ( ) and other diseases such as somatization disorder. Indeed, neuropsychological testing in chronic stages of mTBI (even on the time scale of months) has been criticized as non-specific and insensitive ( ), and several studies have questioned the ecological validity of these assessments ( ) and proposed improved approaches for detecting persisting cognitive deficits and linking these to neuroimaging results ( ). \n\nHeterogeneity of injury and current limitations in the sensitivity of imaging are challenges to developing diagnostic tools as well as predictors of recovery. Some of the major complicating factors include: 1) the fact that mTBI is a heterogeneous injury, with complicated dependencies on the mechanism of injury (e.g. an automobile accident vs. a military blast exposure) and the directional and temporal profiles of the forces impacting the skull and body; 2) mTBI lesions are diffuse and microscopic; and 3) the expected outcome of most patients is an eventual recovery. Thus, the physical size and heterogeneous distribution of injury in the brain make detection in an individual challenging and further make reliance on group averages problematic. In addition, since the time course of the injury leads to lingering post-concussive symptoms in a small number or injuries ( ), it is a statistically challenging goal to try to predict which individuals will not recover fully. Finally, longitudinally, the presence or absence of CT findings does not correlate with long-term outcomes such as PCS ( ). To summarize, imaging is challenging at both acute and chronic stages of mTBI, and attempting to characterize the full time course compounds the level of complexity. \n\nDespite the challenges, there has been a growing research effort to characterize structural and functional effects of mTBI. As shown in this paper, the full range of neuroimaging technologies have been brought to bear on this issue, including CT, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencencephalography (EEG), and 12 subtypes of MRI, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), arterial spin labeling (ASL) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, collectively, these studies have examined mTBI at both acute and chronic stages of the injury. In reviewing the literature, it is important to note that the time post-injury of a study can affect its participant exclusion criterion, leading to prospective and symptomatic mTBI groups ( ). In prospective mTBI studies, the exclusion criteria are independent from mTBI (e.g. specific age ranges or drug dependences). Symptomatic mTBI studies recruit chronic participants. Based on estimated recovery rates, this corresponds to effectively excluding the majority of those who sustain mTBIs. In other words, studies of symptomatic groups enroll participants because they have lingering complaints caused (presumably) by their head injury, whereas prospective studies recruit based on mTBI records at the time of concussion (before any chronic mTBI is known). \n\nThis paper broadly reviews mTBI neuroimaging studies of structure and function to highlight the tremendous effort that has taken place to investigate the spectrum of acute to chronic time scales. We additionally provide meta-analyses to examine the current utility of MRI for studying both structure and function. In terms of structure, some reports claim that MRI is more sensitive to detect complicated mTBI than CT ( ). Similar to other authors, we use complicated mTBI to include the broad range of abnormalities that lead to non-negative imaging results ( ). It should be pointed out that definitions of \u2018mild\u2019 vary widely among both clinicians and researchers. Thus while many studies exclude participants with imaging findings, this is not universally the case. Among the other neuroimaging methods, it is also unique in that it can be used to study both structure and function. Many physical parameters provide MRI with a wide range of contrast mechanisms, enabling \u201ctraditional\u201d T1- and T2-weighted structural scans, neural correlates of brain function using fMRI, white-matter microstructure by diffusion MRI, and biochemistry through MR spectroscopy. Thus our meta-analyses focus on three areas of MRI study. The first meta-analysis is motivated by the heterogeneity of fMRI findings and focuses on the question of anatomical consistency for fMRI. Similarly, the second analysis examines the issue of white matter vulnerability to mTBI. Looking at anatomically localized findings, previous neuroimaging data suggest that anterior regions of the brain are more vulnerable to abnormalities ( ). However, published reports are highly heterogeneous in their findings of regional white matter changes. Thus we examined whether anatomical consistency in mTBI lesions exists in the literature. \n\nOur third meta-analysis examines the apparent inconsistency in diffusion-based anisotropy findings across studies that has led to debates about whether or not anisotropy values increase, decrease, or even change at all after mTBI ( ) as well as whether anisotropy levels positively or negatively correlate with performance levels in neuropsychological assessments ( ). Recent reports suggest that it is important to consider the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging ( ). For example,   suggest that anisotropy is increased in the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase in symptomatic TBI patients. Similarly   note that anisotropy values can be either reduced or increased in semi-acute time points, but tend to be decreased in later, chronic stages of symptomatic mTBI. Based on these considerations, we tested the hypotheses that anisotropy is increased in the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis that considered the time post-injury of each study's mTBI cohort. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data collection \n  \nWe queried PubMed ( ) for articles on imaging-based mTBI studies. The authors extracted key information from these articles and entered items into a LimeSurvey database ( ) that we developed for this study. LimeSurvey is an open source web-based survey application that features an unlimited number of participants in a survey (in our case, each paper constituted a survey participant) and flexible export functions to multiple text and software formats. The LimeSurvey web interface enabled the authors to collaborate from different locations. Data from the articles were manually entered into LimeSurvey and these data were examined and summarized using custom-built Python parsing scripts. See Supplementary Materials for the actual survey we used for each paper. \n\nWe examined publications spanning 21 years from 1990 to 2011 using a query focused on mTBI and neuroimaging:  \n(mTBI or \u201cmild traumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cpost concussive syndrome\u201d or \u201cpost concussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussive syndrome\u201d) and (neuroimaging or \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d or MRI or \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d or PET or magnetoencephalography or MEG or electroencephalography or EEG or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or fMRI or \u201cdiffusion tensor imaging\u201d or DTI or T2 or \u201cdiffusion spectrum imaging\u201d or DSI or \u201cdiffusion weighted imaging\u201d or DWI or SWI or \u201csusceptibility weighted imaging\u201d or \u201cT2*\u201d or \u201cCT\u201d or \u201ccomputed tomography\u201d or FLAIR or \u201cdiffusion kurtosis imaging\u201d or \u201cdiffusional kurtosis imaging\u201d or DKI or \u201csingle photon emission computed tomography\u201d or SPECT or NIRS or \u201cnear-infrared spectroscopy\u201d or fNIRS or \u201cfunctional near-infrared spectroscopy\u201d or \u201cresting state\u201d or \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d or \u201cdefault mode network\u201d) and (\u201c1990\u201d [Publication Date]: \u201c2011\u201d [Publication Date]). \n \n\nOur search date was November 11, 2011. This query resulted in 298 publications from which we excluded 176, using seven exclusion criteria. Specifically, we excluded 85 review articles, 47 non-imaging articles (most of which mentioned CT in relation to subjects' TBI status, but without any association to a statistical variable), 13 case studies, 12 animal studies, 9 articles that mixed mTBI with moderate\/severe TBI or PTSD, 7 articles that were not in English, and 3 others (a video article, a fatigue article, and a mold exposure article). See Table S1 for a full listing of the 122 publications that we included \n\nWe extracted the following into the LimeSurvey database: 1) Time after concussion (the median\/mean time between injury and neuroimaging). If studies were longitudinal or had multiple groups of subjects, multiple time points were reported. 2) Range of time after concussion (the minimum and maximum time between injury and neuroimaging). In publications where only standard deviations were provided, we approximated the range as the median\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 standard deviations. Note that this is analogous to the 90% confidence interval. 3) Number of subjects (sum of mTBI and control groups). Note that some publications (such as longitudinal studies) included multiple separated time points. 4) Imaging modality (CT, 12 subtypes of MRI including DTI and fMRI, PET, SPECT, MEG, EEG and near infrared spectrometry). 5) Hypothesized effect of mTBI motivating the imaging study, which we termed the \u201ctheme.\u201d For example, several studies hypothesized that mTBI would lead to white matter abnormalities, and thus to characterize this they measured anisotropy. In contrast, studies that hypothesized that connectivity would be affected, could address this research \u201ctheme\u201d not only by using diverse measures including fMRI but also diffusion imaging-based tractography. 6) Other imaging results (anatomical coordinates, ROIs with significant anisotropy, and other parameters). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe fMRI meta-analysis used Ginger ALE ( ). All fMRI coordinates were converted into Talairach space. We used the default Ginger ALE parameters ( ), and additionally added the number of subjects per experiment. We chose a false discovery rate threshold level of 0.05. We used all available fMRI publications of mTBI, most of which used working memory tasks, but the tasks also included resting state fMRI, an auditory odd-ball task, and a spatial navigation task ( ). Only coordinates from contrast images using two-sample test (mTBI and control) were included. AFNI ( ) was used to present fMRI meta-analysis images in Talairach space. \n\nFor the DTI meta-analyses, each reported region of interest (ROI) was coded using the ICBM-81 atlas ( ). ROIs that were outside of this atlas were only used in the analyses involving time post-injury and omitted for the spatial DTI analysis. Most publications reported FA values, however we also included studies that reported relative anisotropy (RA). Publications found anisotropy differences in two predominant ways \u2014 either categorically (by examining anisotropy means between mTBI and control groups), or parametrically (through regression analyses correlating anisotropy values with neuropsychological performance). AFNI ( ) was used to present DTI meta-analysis results in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. \n\nAs in other publications that account for diverse sets of assessment scores ( ), we normalized neuropsychological results using algebraic negation (multiplying the original score with a negative one) such that better performance corresponds to positive scores. For example, we did not transform results from the California verbal learning test in which scores should be higher for normal performance than for impaired performance, but we did transform (negate) completion time for the Trail making A test (in this case, better raw scores are lower, corresponding to faster completion times). Our motivation for doing this was that it enables us to unambiguously discuss negative and positive correlations between neuropsychological results with changes in imaging measures. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neuroimaging literature \n  \nThe number of mTBI publications has dramatically increased over the past two decades.  A shows the number of publications with respect to time for the neuroimaging articles we analyzed in the context of mTBI research as a whole. The more general mTBI PubMed search in  A excluded our neuroimaging keywords (to include both imaging and non-imaging studies). Specifically, we used (mTBI or \u201cmild traumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cpost concussive syndrome\u201d or \u201cpost concussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussion syndrome\u201d or \u201cpostconcussive syndrome\u201d) and (\u201c1990\u201d[Publication Date]: \u201c2011\u201d[Publication Date]). The figure shows that the rate of mTBI publications has been increasing over time, with a notable upsurge occurring around 2007.  B classifies imaging modalities of the publications we analyzed over time. Most of the imaging modalities are MRI-based. The number of studies relying (at least in part) on CT is relatively large, primarily because it is used ubiquitously (and almost exclusively) in emergency room settings. Thus, CT was used as part of the clinical characterization of the subjects in many studies. The functional modalities (EEG\/MEG, fMRI, SPECT\/PET, and ASL) have been steadily used during the time period shown. \n\n show that structural and functional neuroimaging studies have examined mTBI across acute to chronic time scales with a wide range of imaging modalities. It is important to note that the number of subjects in these publications represents the total number of mTBI and control participants for each experiment, which could include different participant cohorts. Note too, that many experiments have large variability for subjects' post-injury data collection times. Also, while the number of subjects includes control participants, for obvious reasons these controls did not contribute to the post-injury collection times in these  . Focusing on some observations from each figure,   shows that CT studies have been performed on both small and large cohorts, but the majority of these studies occur soon after injury, usually using the subjects' clinical CTs. DTI and the other structural modalities have a much better coverage of the time post-injury. For  , one observation is that many EEG studies also occur soon after injury but in contrast to CT, EEG has also been broadly applied to the entire time course post-injury and to a large number of subjects.   also shows that task-based fMRI has been similarly broadly applied, while resting state fMRI studies have predominantly focused on acute and semi-acute time ranges. PET, ASL, CE-MRI and MEG seem to be rarely used. In addition, there is a lack of PET studies of acute mTBI and both PET and MRS publications used groups that were smaller than 40 subjects. \n\nThe research areas of neuroimaging studies tend to follow distinct structural and functional categories as shown in  . As mentioned previously, CT was used as part of the clinical characterization of the subjects in many studies. In papers where CT was a research focus, it was used to examine structural abnormalities arising from mTBI. Although the category of \u201cmild\u201d TBI sometimes includes the stipulation of negative findings, CTs can nonetheless be used to detect abnormalities from a wide range of trauma severities that appear as hyper- or hypo-intensities observed in gray matter or white matter regions as well as hematomas, cerebral swelling, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Gray matter is composed largely of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, and the capillaries. White matter abnormalities are thought to reflect stretched or sheared axon bundles or abnormal cellular microstructures. Abnormalities not clearly falling into the categories of hematomas or white\/gray matter findings have been designated as \u201ccomplicated mTBI\u201d in  . Complicated mTBI was examined fifty-six times in our publication sample, mainly using CT and MRI. Gray matter (GM) abnormalities were only reported in one T1 and one CT study. Abnormal blood brain barrier (BBB) permeabilities were reported by three publications using SPECT and CT (CT studies also detected tau\/S100b proteins in blood). White matter (WM) abnormalities were examined thirty-eight times (primarily with DTI). Hematomas were only reported in two CT-based studies. Metabolites were analyzed by a PET, a SPECT and five MRS publications. Perfusion was examined by one PET, one ASL and twelve SPECT publications. Task-based imaging was used in seventeen fMRI and fifteen EEG studies, often linking tasks to brain activity. Connectivity analyses were examined twenty-seven times, detecting low frequency activity, connectivity differences between neural regions, EEG pathologies, altered resting state networks (using fMRI), and connectivity maps (using white matter tractography). Neuropsychological assessments were used in seventy-two publications and were the one theme of investigation (despite not relying on any particular imaging modality itself) that spanned all structural and functional modalities. \n\n\n### fMRI meta-analysis \n  \n display results from our MRI meta-analyses (see also downloadable image files in Supplemental data).   shows results from a Ginger ALE analysis of the fMRI publications summarized in  .   also examines how many independent publications support each ALE peaks. The analysis produced six regions that were consistently more active in mTBI compared to control groups and seven regions with lower activity for mTBI. Spatially, these regions suggest an anterior-to-posterior pattern in which activity is reduced in anterior regions and increased in posterior regions. Of the seven regions with decreased mTBI activity, six were in the frontal lobe or anterior cingulate, with the remaining one being relatively posterior (temporal lobe\/BA 39). The regions with increased mTBI activity consisted of two coordinates in the cerebellum, two insula regions, and two foci in the parietal lobe (BA 40). The mean Talairach anterior-to-posterior coordinate for regions with reduced activity was Y\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0mm, compared to Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a023 for increased mTBI activity, and a two-sample   t  -test of Y between the decreased and increased regions was significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05, two tailed). \n\n\n### Anatomical frequency of anisotropy findings \n  \nClose examination of the number and anatomical locations of publications reporting white matter abnormalities revealed significant anatomical heterogeneity as shown in  . See   for white matter regions in the ICBM-81 atlas as well as their abbreviations and center-of-mass coordinates. It is important to note that several ICBM-81 regions have not been reported by the publications we examined. These include the pontine crossing tract, medial lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncle, cerebral peduncle, posterior thalamic radiation, cingulum to hippocampus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, tapetum, and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. These unreported regions were coded in two ways; both leading to statistically significant correlations between anatomical location, along anterior-to-posterior gradient, and the number of abnormalities. Specifically, we calculated a Spearman correlation 1) omitting these regions from the statistical test (using only regions that had reported abnormal findings in the literature) resulting in a \u03c1 \u00a0=\u00a00.26 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.026); and 2) including the unreported regions (coding their frequency as zero) resulting in a \u03c1 \u00a0=\u00a00.32 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0025). We did not find significant correlations in the inferior-to-superior or left-to-right directions. Laterality of the regions was also not significant. \n\n\n### Anisotropy changes depend on imaging time post-injury \n  \nBased on observations by   as well as  , we wanted to examine the hypothesis that anisotropy would be elevated at acute time points and depressed post acutely.   demonstrates the critical importance of accounting for the time post-injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. Shown are the time-resolved anisotropy results for each study. In  A, studies compared mTBI groups to control groups. In  B, studies correlated mTBI anisotropy values with neuropsychological performance. Note that some publications report experimental results at two different chronological points ( ) and thus are represented by two bars. Another complication with the literature is that some research groups seem to have used overlapping mTBI cohorts across publications (see potential overlap in boxed bars in  ). Thus counting each bar in   as an independent measure likely leads to inflated estimates of significance. To account for this, we report the most conservative statistical estimate by using each boxed group as a single experiment. As shown, elevated anisotropy values are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI (<\u00a02\u00a0weeks), while depressed anisotropy findings are reported more frequently for post-acute mTBI (>\u00a02\u00a0weeks). In  A, a two-sample   t  -test confirms that anisotropy is greater in the acute phase (one-tailed, 14 DOF, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In  B, acute phase anisotropy was also significantly anti-correlated with neuropsychological performance compared to a predominant positive correlation in the post acute phase (one-tailed, 7 DOF, p\u00a0<\u00a00.006). Finally, to put these results into the context of the literature, it is important to note that the participant populations were recruited using different criteria in the acute and chronic periods. Specifically, all of the acute studies recruited prospective mTBI subjects, the majority of whom would be expected to recover from their injuries. Conversely, many of the post-acute mTBI studies of anisotropy selected for symptomatic subjects. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAn obvious key limitation of this paper (and any review that attempts to report a snapshot of a vibrant field) is that components of it are immediately outdated. Although we believe that the conclusions we draw here will be qualitative accurate for the next few years, the literature we sampled just barely supported any meaningful fMRI meta-analyses, and the issue of the anisotropy values' dependence on time post-injury is far from conclusive. Part of what we have hoped to accomplish here is an assessment of the modalities, questions, and times post-injury that recent publications have examined. Based on this we hope that research teams can use this to strategically bolster areas of this field that would most benefit from additional effort. We are optimistic that we and\/or others will improve our literature analysis approaches in the future to continue what has the potential to become an ongoing, reflective process. \n\nOur review of the mTBI literature highlights the fact that currently about 1\/10th of published studies have a human neuroimaging component and that several small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points have been conducted. These studies have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Indeed, in addition to highlighting the fact that research topics have largely (but not exclusively) fallen into either structural or functional categories and providing a sense of the proportion of work that has been devoted to the two,   strikingly shows that neuropsychology appears to be the predominant commonality across the imaging literature. This underscores the fact that mTBI neuroimaging efforts have prioritized attempting to link brain measurements with neuropsychological assessments. Despite the large efforts to date, neuroimaging methods still lack the individual patient-level sensitivity and specificity to serve as a diagnostic tool for mTBI. Similar to other reviews in this area ( ), we believe that ultimate motivations for further neuroimaging work are to provide data to predict an individual's recovery, measure her\/his transient and persistent cognitive deficits at a level that compliments or exceeds the sensitivity of neuropsychiatric testing, and quantifies the success of cognitive and drug-based interventions ( ). In the meantime, the field needs further effort to provide stronger correlative understanding of the relationships between neuroimaging and neuropsychiatry, and simultaneously both types of measures also need improvement. \n\nOur fMRI and DTI meta-analyses show, however, that there is hope for consistent neuroimaging markers of structure and function. The fMRI meta-analysis results in   and   show a frontal vulnerability in mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal compared to controls. fMRI studies consistently report decreased activity in mTBI in frontal regions such as right MFG, ACC, and right precentral gyrus. Our finding of bilateral decreases in DLPFC is consistent with three published studies ( ). The DLPFC may be related with working memory. Specific localization of working memory intense regions was found in non-human research ( ) and in humans using fMRI ( ). Even though DLPFC responds to working memory it is a very complex region and serves a multitude of cognitive functions ( ). Interestingly, among the most significant mTBI increases, right cerebellar tonsil and left culmen, were noted in four independent publications ( ).  , has noted that the cerebellum has been implicated for regulating behavior, working memory, and other aspects of executive control. In addition, it has long been recognized that cerebellar lesions can lead to postural deficits ( ), which is a prominent issue in mTBI ( ). Finally, it is important to note that the well-known fMRI issue of multiple comparisons correction may be a limitation of our Ginger ALE analysis. Most of the publications that we used corrected their findings for multiple comparisons. However, notable exceptions include   and  . Although the predominance of anterior fMRI and DTI findings suggests that frontal areas are more vulnerable to injury, we have not ruled out other possible explanations with this current study (for example, it is possible that there is a sampling bias in the literature, which favors injury mechanisms that lead to more injuries in prefrontal cortex). Another limitation of this fMRI meta-analysis is that, unlike the diffusion-weighted literature, the number of fMRI studies published did not have power enough for an fMRI analysis using time post-injury. We feel that \u201ctime-resolving\u201d fMRI studies could be an important area for future investigation. \n\nStructurally, diffusion weighted imaging is currently one of the most promising techniques for characterizing the subtle and heterogeneous changes that occur with mTBI. Note Supplemental Table 2 lists specific details about the studies used to generate  .   demonstrates that differences in the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy values have an anterior to posterior gradient. Taken independently, each DTI study shows white matter differences that seem to be sporadic. When integrating across all reported findings, though, these frequencies of abnormalities have a systematic spatial distribution corroborating previous suggestions that anterior regions of the brain are more vulnerable to abnormalities ( ). Anterior regions may also be related with executive\/cognitive function disabilities in mTBI ( ). \n\nUsing the existing literature to time-resolve results,   suggests that white matter anisotropy can serve as an important potential marker of both chronic symptoms as well as of an acute response to secondary injuries. Taken together, the literature demonstrates that elevated anisotropy values (and negative correlations with neuropsychological performance) are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI, while depressed anisotropy findings (and positive correlations with neuropsychological performance) are reported more frequently for chronic studies. Our analyses show that elevated anisotropy values are more frequently reported for studies of acute mTBI, while depressed anisotropy findings are reported more frequently for post-acute studies, corroborating conjectures of   and  . Thus,   helps to clarify an apparent inconsistency in the literature about anisotropy changes after mTBI by \u201ctime resolving\u201d the results. In addition,  B raises important new questions about the interactions of anisotropy, neuropsychological performance, and time post-injury. In particular, the fact that cognitive performance is negatively correlated with anisotropy during acute stages, but positively correlated with anisotropy chronically is puzzling. \n\nAt least two issues remain outstanding with the results in  . The first is the inconsistency in  A of the results for paper XXI ( ). In discussing their results,   are careful to point out that the small sample size of their study calls for more future work. However, they also suggest potential explanations for their findings, including the possibility that the observed increases in FA could reflect recovery from injury; or that specific degradation mechanisms could target subsets of fibers, leading to enhanced FA; or, finally, that the increases in FA are compensatory for other observed decreases in other brain regions. The second issue relates to the heterogeneity of the neuropsychological testing in the papers used to generate  B. Thus a limitation in the literature (and in our results) is the lack of consistency of neuropsychological assessment. As previously mentioned, we have \u201cnormalized\u201d the scores such that better performance corresponds to a positive score, regardless of what test was used. We note, however, in light of the literature's \u201cuncontrolled assessment variance\u201d, that our results are conservative as well as robust across cognitive domains and testing variability. Undoubtedly, though, more sensitive, standardized assessments that are specifically adapted to mTBI are needed to further reduce the limitations of these types of studies. \n\nThe results of   and the outstanding issues that we have raised suggest that more studies focused on mTBI and anisotropy are warranted and necessary. At this point we can only conjecture on possible explanations for our meta-analysis results. One possibility for the increase in FA acutely is that MR diffusion-based measurements are not purely sensitive to white matter microstructure, but additionally are inflated by acute stage secondary injury or compensatory mechanisms ( ). The idea behind this is that inflammation and secondary injury factors (including ischemia, cerebral hypoxia, and cerebral edema) may increase anisotropy in acute phase, but that these factors do not contribute in the chronic phase. Chronically, though, residual damage of white matter could lead to a decreased anisotropy signal. A second possible explanation of  B, however, is that there is not a simple causal relationship between anisotropy and cognitive performance. Whatever the mechanism,  B indicates that poor neuropsychological performance is associated with high anisotropy scores immediately after injury and with low anisotropy in the chronic phase. From a statistical point of view,  A demonstrates a main effect between anisotropy and time post-injury, but  B additionally indicates an interaction with cognitive performance. We have previously mentioned that there is controversy surrounding anisotropy changes after TBI. Nonetheless   note in their review of the literature a general acceptance that decreases in FA values are expected after TBI induced axonal injury. However, they also point out that mechanisms for increases in FA are also possible (e.g. unequal injury in one fiber in voxels where two or more fibers cross). Furthermore, there are examples in other disorders (such as autism) where widespread differences have been noted in the relationship of FA with cognitive function ( ). Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of anisotropy changes following TBI will likely need to rely on methods and validation studies in animal models such as those of   and   to relate pathology to diffusion tensor imaging findings. Finally, the majority of the literature focuses on FA, but some publications report radial diffusion (RD), axial diffusion (AD) and mean diffusion (MD) diffusion as well. The four measures are related to each other and usually FA and AD are significant in the same direction while MD and RD tend to be significant in the opposite direction. Results of these measures are found in supplemental Table S2. \n\nTo summarize, this review and meta-analysis have demonstrated several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. A broad range of neuroimaging modalities are being applied to this problem across the range of post-injury time scales and an important component of many studies is the effort to link imaging measurements to neuropsychological assessments of cognitive deficits. Upon closer scrutiny of two MRI-based modalities, we demonstrated the importance of interpreting white-matter measures of anisotropy in the context of time post-injury and for both structure and function we evaluated whether or not consistent findings were available for evaluating anatomical vulnerability to mTBI. The fact that we have been able to produce statistically significant results in this area is encouraging. Based on the complexity of the injury, however, much more work in this area is required. Future publications focused in depth for each image modality would greatly complement this generic analysis and the field of mTBI. Here we have been able to preliminarily examine important factors related to anatomical vulnerability and time post-injury, but these issues need to be refined with future data and many other factors remain to be studied (e.g. injury mechanism differences, number and timing of previous concussions, and psychological comorbidities including major depression and post-traumatic stress) ( ). Ultimately a major driving motivation for continued study is the further efficacy of neuroimaging for clinical diagnosis at both acute and chronic stages and the synergistic improvement with neuropsychological assessments and rehabilitation strategies. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4107372,"text_md5":"4142e221c0e9246f788939a121cf9a60","field_positions":{"authors":[0,139],"journal":[140,155],"publication_year":[157,161],"title":[172,245],"keywords":[259,366],"abstract":[379,3002],"body":[3011,40638]},"batch":3,"pmid":25061565,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2013.12.009","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4107372","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4107372"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4107372\">4107372<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4107372  Neuroimaging after mild traumatic brain injury: Review and meta-analysis\u2606"}
{"text":"Gray, Oliver and Fry, Lewis and Montaldi, Daniela\nSci Rep, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nInformation content best characterises the hemispheric selectivity of the inferior parietal lobe: a meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nNeuroscience\nPsychology\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nOur understanding of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) remains challenged by inconsistencies between neuroimaging and neuropsychological perspectives. To date, others assume that hemispheric specialisation of the IPL is linked with the type of processing; attention processing in the right hemisphere; memory retrieval and semantic judgement in the left hemisphere. Here, we provide compelling evidence associating the type of information being processed with the recruitment of each hemisphere\u2019s IPL. In a meta-analysis, we classify 121 previous fMRI reports of IPL activity arising from episodic memory retrieval, according to the type of information that characterises each fMRI contrast. We demonstrate that the left IPL is more consistently associated with retrieval of the semantic (95% of eligible contrasts) than perceptual aspects of memory (83%). In contrast, the right IPL is more consistently associated with the retrieval of perceptual (97%), than semantic aspects of memory (43%). This work revises assumptions of how the IPL contributes to healthy cognition and has major implications for IPL-related neuropsychological deficits. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOur understanding of the complex brain systems that support the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memory, the what, where, and when of life\u2019s events, has vastly improved with the advent of neuroimaging. However, for the last 15\u00a0years, the functional role played by the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), which includes the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, in the retrieval of episodic memory has been the source of contentious debate . Numerous functions, including the successful retrieval of episodic memories, have been strongly associated with activity in the IPL . Despite the consistency of this association, an intriguing disconnect exists between the seemingly minimal effects of damage to the IPL on patients\u2019 memory, and the IPL activity consistently observed during the retrieval of episodic memory in healthy participants . \n\nMemory researchers have offered several hypotheses to account for this theoretical discord between human lesion and neuroimaging observations . Recently, Humphreys & Lambon Ralph  considered these hypotheses and their supporting data together to generate the Parietal Unified Connectivity-biased Computation (PUCC) framework. Although PUCC provides interpretations of much of the data pertaining to parietal lobe functions, the framework, like most others that preceded it, provides limited insight into why neuroimaging studies frequently report parietal cortex activations that are lateralised to a single hemisphere of the brain. In this article, we consider previous models of parietal function and perform a meta-analysis to directly investigate this hemispheric lateralisation and its causes. \n\nThe attention to memory (AToM) model of parietal cortex function is one perspective that has divided scientific opinion, and both support and criticism has been provided by a mixture of investigative methods . The AToM model proposes that the IPL performs a similar function in both spatial attention and memory retrieval . Subregions within the IPL have been shown to regulate the reflexive allocation of attention to salient information  and the AToM model proposes that the IPL supports bottom-up allocation of resources to the salient contents of medial temporal lobe output. More recent evidence has, however, identified spatial activation differences between IPL subregions that were separately associated with the allocation of attention and episodic memory retrieval . These studies have shown that the AToM model is likely to be an overly simplistic explanation of IPL function. Building on the episodic buffer hypothesis , the PUCC framework suggests instead that reflexive attention capture to sensory perceptions or episodic memories may emerge intrinsically as a function of the IPL integrating the spatial or temporal state of new perceptual or memory information with that of the current context . Though more contemporary models explain parietal function more completely, the AToM model introduced the important idea that features of parietal function observed in one domain could be extrapolated to explain another . This idea was central to the development of our working definitions of perceptually and semantically-defined memory experiences which we describe below. \n\nIt is well established that healthy individuals implicitly and preferentially allocate more spatial attention to the left visual field than the right; a phenomenon known as pseudoneglect (e.g. ). A large body of research attributes this effect to the specialisation of attention allocation processing by the right ventral attention network, including the IPL (e.g.  ). Pseudoneglect represents an example of a behavioural manifestation of hemispheric specialisation in these brain regions that might also be observed in memory. In contrast, the left hemisphere generally shows an obvious specialisation in language and semantic processing . This specialisation has also been linked closely with the IPL with specific reference to the computation of word and sentence-level semantic information . Here, we investigate the previous claim that memory retrieval processes also exhibit hemispheric specialisation of IPL function in the left hemisphere and propose a different specialisation based on the informational content of the representation being remembered. \n\nWe ask whether the hemispheric specialisations of the IPL, previously observed for spatial attention allocation  and semantic processing  are also evident for episodic memory processing. We performed a meta-analysis of previous fMRI investigations of episodic memory retrieval that observed IPL activations. These highly variable previous studies were classified according to whether they assessed the retrieval of either perceptual\/experiential or semantic\/conceptual aspects of episodic memories. As spatial attention allocation is intrinsically linked to the perceptual processing of incoming sensory information, predominantly in the visual domain, we hypothesised that the IPL shares a common hemispheric specialisation for retrieving detailed perceptual information from episodic memory and processing spatial attention. Similarly, we predicted that common hemispheric specialisations would be evident in the IPL during the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information from episodic memory and the processing of language. Accordingly, conditions in which performance depended on memory for the perceptual details of the original encounter, rather than semantic concepts, were expected to engage the right hemisphere IPL more than the left. Conversely, we expected left hemisphere IPL activations to be more prevalent than the right during semantic\/conceptual retrieval of episodic memories. \n\nMemory assessments were classified according to both the informational content of the memory that had been encoded and the specific requirements of the retrieval challenge at test. A perceptually defined memory experience was characterised by two primary features: 1) the encoding of detailed sensory information, most often in the visual domain, and 2) memory tests in which accurate performance was highly dependent on re-experiencing sensory information. For example, the detailed perceptual features of the encoded item (e.g. a semi-consumed glass of beer) are crucial to distinguishing between two similar variants of the same item (e.g. distinguishing between that glass of beer and a fuller one). Two very different criteria were used to classify a semantically\/conceptually defined memory experience: (1) information stored in memory with limited perceptual detail, and (2) memory tests in which accurate performance could be achieved through memory for a semantic or conceptual label alone. For example, without needing to draw on the raw percept that led to that memory, one may accurately recognise that they had encountered the concept \u2018beer\u2019 earlier. To summarise, our classifications were based on the stimuli, encoding challenge, and retrieval challenge as well as the information represented in the fMRI contrast of interest (e.g., recall of visual features\u2009>\u2009narrative information would be classified as a perceptually defined memory experience). \n\n\n## Methods\u2014meta-analysis of IPL episodic retrieval memory effect \n  \n### Identification and eligibility \n  \nThe process of identification, screening, and classification of eligible studies to create a representative sample of the literature is illustrated in the PRISMA 2009 flow diagram Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . A brief summary of the encoding and retrieval methods, specific contrasts, and the resulting IPL activations for each study included in the review are provided in Supplementary Table   and  .   \n(  A  ) IPL associated activations in semantically (blue), and perceptually (red) defined memory contrasts mapped onto an inflated template brain. Notes: Large spheres represent activations where the IPL associated activation was also the peak activation. Small spheres represent non-peak activations associated with the IPL. Readers should interpret the precise location of activations with caution as they reflect peak activations rather than illustrating the direction and extent of the activations across the brain. (  B  ) A graphical representation of the percentage of IPL activations in the left and right hemisphere associated with semantically, and perceptually defined memory contrasts. \n  \n\nStudies published prior to October 2019 were identified through   searches. We targeted studies written in the English language for assessment of eligibility using the terms: memory, retrieval, fMRI and then checked that the abstracts of articles matching these keywords were episodic memory research. Where it was unclear in the abstract whether relevant data would be available, the full manuscript was assessed for eligibility. Studies included in the analysis contained at least one univariate episodic memory contrast with an activation specifically reported in the angular gyrus and\/or supramarginal gyrus of the left and\/or right hemisphere. \n\n\n### Classification \n  \nA total of 65 eligible studies provided 121 contrasts for our analyses. We made a binary distintion (see our criteria above) between episodic memory contrasts that probed predominantly semantic\/conceptual information at retrieval (76 contrasts) and those that required the retrieval of perceptual details (45 contrasts). Our criteria for classification were established and agreed collectively (OG and DM). A set of five studies (indicated in Supplementary Tables   and  ) were then used as a training set to improve the consistency of the classifications across the reviewers (OG, LF, DM). Two training studies were chosen randomly from each of the preliminary perceptual and semantic classifications of OG. A third study (Dobbins et al  .  ) was chosen deliberately to illustrate that our classifications should focus on fMRI contrasts rather than fMRI studies, and thus a single study could contribute both a perceptually and semantically defined contrast to the analysis. The classification of each contrast was then performed independently by each reviewer. Importantly, LF was blind to our hypotheses regarding the hemispheric specialisation of the IPL. After each reviewer had assessed and reported all contrasts, the reviewers met to discuss each contrast which was not agreed upon by all three reviewers (21 contrasts, OG-LF\u201416, DM-LF\u201414, OG-DM\u20149). After discussion and clarification of details of the tasks and contrasts reported in the respective papers, all these discrepancies were resolved. \n\nWe then further delineated the contrasts by considering the extent of the contribution of semantic and perceptual information to the memory retrieved. Each imaging contrast was rated 1 to 5, where 1\u2009=\u2009definitively semantic retrieval, 2\u2009=\u2009semantic retrieval with some perceptual retrieval, 3\u2009=\u2009a near equal contribution of semantic and perceptual retrieval, 4\u2009=\u2009perceptual retrieval with some semantic retrieval, 5\u2009=\u2009definitively perceptual retrieval. \n\nWe also performed a further classification of perceptually and semantically defined retrieval contrasts, based on the contribution of recall\/recollection or familiarity memory processing. This utilised the definitions and reports of these processes provided in the original studies. For this analysis, only contrasts where the memory retrieval episode was clearly more reliant on one type of memory (e.g. a remember\u2009>\u2009know paradigm) were included. Contrasts characterised by approximately matched levels of the same process (e.g. matched recollection\u2014source memory for words that were seen\u2009>\u2009source memory for words that were heard) were excluded. We also excluded contrasts without a clear contribution of one of these processes over the other (e.g. recognition hits\u2009>\u2009correct rejections). \n\nLastly, we recorded the type of stimulus being remembered (visually presented words, images, other), the date of publication of each study, and we rated the stringency of the correction for multiple comparisons applied to each contrast of interest on a scale from 1\u20135: 1\u2009=\u2009the most lenient corrections; 5\u2009=\u2009the most stringent corrections. We differentiated between contrasts that utilised a lenient threshold (e.g.   p  \u2009<\u2009.05) and were uncorrected for multiple comparisons (1); contrasts with an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and uncorrected cluster threshold (2); more stringent voxelwise and\/or cluster extent thresholds without reference to false discovery rates (FDR) or family-wise error (FWE) corrections (3); voxelwise or cluster extent thresholds with FDR corrections (4); and those contrasts with family-wise error (FWE) corrected (voxelwise\/cluster extent) thresholds (5). \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \nThe presence of IPL activation in each hemisphere was classified as the dependent variable. We assessed factors potentially affecting the probability of IPL activation using multiple regression analyses implemented in R  using the glm package. Omnibus likelihood ratio tests and the subsequent assessment of specific model terms were conducted using the nagelkerke and Anova functions implemented in the rcompanion and car packages respectively . Pseudo-R  values were calculated using the nagelkerke function. These regression analyses assessed the probability of IPL activation in each hemisphere according to the contrast\u2019s classification as semantically or perceptually-defined, the type of stimulus used, the year of publication of the associated study, and the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons. Assessment of the relationship between memory processes (e.g. recall) and IPL activations was excluded from the multiple regression analyses because of the limited availability of data in some conditions. Instead, summary comparisons of this data are provided in the results section. To ensure that our effects were not driven by multiple contrasts generated by one group of subjects from a single study, we generated bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals using the boot package . This bootstrap approach used the strata function to repeatedly estimate the regression fit using a sample of one randomly selected contrast from each study. In Supplementary Table 1 and 2, we provide details of each contrast of interest, including the encoding and retrieval procedures that were performed by participants. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nImaging contrasts of memory paradigms that require retrieval of perceptual information show activation of the right IPL in 96% (43\/45) of cases. The same contrasts elicit left IPL activations in 77% (35\/45) of cases. Instead, during the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information, the left IPL is active far more consistently, 97% (74\/76), than the same cortical area in the right hemisphere, 43% (33\/76). Figure\u00a0 B illustrates the proportion of these semantically, and perceptually defined imaging contrasts that were associated with IPL activations in each hemisphere. Importantly, the stringency of corrections for multiple comparisons did not explain these differences. In the most stringently thresholded contrasts (ratings 4 & 5), paradigms requiring retrieval of perceptual information showed right IPL activation in 97% (34\/35) of cases. Similarly, less stringently corrected contrasts (ratings 1 & 2) showed right IPL activiation in 80% (8\/10) of cases. We identified left IPL activation in 82% (29\/35) of stringent and 60% (6\/10) of lenient perceptually-defined contrasts. Contrasts involving the retrieval of semantic or conceptual information displayed left IPL activation in 93% (31\/33) of stringent and 100% of lenient cases. In contrast, the right IPL displayed activation in only 42% of stringent and 45% of lenient contrasts requiring semantic or conceptual information retrieval. \n\nTwo separate multiple logistic regression analyses assessed the probability of IPL activation in each hemisphere (one analysis per hemisphere) according to the contrast\u2019s binary classification (semantic\/perceptual), the stimulus type (visually presented words\/images\/other), the year of publication of the associated study, and the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons (1\u2014least stringent to 5\u2014most stringent). Both of these models both explained significantly more variance than a comparable null model (probability of left IPL activation\u2014\u03c7 (df H -H \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200915.03,   p  \u2009=\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.24; probability of right IPL activation\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200922.19,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.41). We observed significantly greater probability of activation in the left hemisphere\u2019s IPL for semantically-defined than perceptual-defined memory retrieval contrasts (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200912.65,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, mean estimate (  M  )\u2009=\u20092.96, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20094.28, CI [1.56, 19.95]). In contrast, probability of activation was significantly greater in the right hemisphere\u2019s IPL for perceptually-defined than semantically-defined memory retrieval contrasts (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200938.77,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.89, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095.01, CI [\u2212\u200920.60, \u2212\u20092.97]). Neither model observed a significant effect of stimulus type (left IPL\u2014\u03c7 (2)\u2009=\u20091.22,   p  \u2009=\u2009.54, average   M  \u2009=\u20090.60, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.80, CI [\u2212\u20091.65, 0.61]; right IPL\u2014\u03c7 (2)\u2009=\u20094.60,   p  \u2009=\u2009.10, average   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.47, average bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.81, CI [\u2212\u200912.60, \u2212\u20090.04]), the stringency of correction for multiple comparisons (left IPL\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20090.84,   p  \u2009=\u2009.35,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.42, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.45, CI [\u2212\u20090.82, \u2212\u20090.02]; right IPL\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20091.68,   p  \u2009=\u2009.19,   M  \u2009=\u20090.28, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.30, CI [0.04, 0.60]), nor the year of publication (left IPL\u2014(\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20091.36,   p  \u2009=\u2009.24,   M  \u2009=\u20090.12, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u20090.12, CI [0.03, 0.23]; right IPL\u2014(\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20090.50,   p  \u2009=\u2009.48,   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04, bootstrap   M  \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04, CI [\u2212\u20090.11, 0.02]). \n\nThe analyses presented in this section use our binary classification of episodic memory contrasts as either perceptually-defined or semantically-defined and assess the probability of activation in the IPL as a whole. In Supplementary Analysis 1, we provide the results of further logistic regression analyses that assessed activation probabilities according to our five point ratings (1\u2009=\u2009definitively semantic, 3\u2009=\u2009a near equal contribution, 5\u2009=\u2009definitively perceptual) of the semantic and perceptual contributions to each memory retrieval contrast. In Supplementary Analysis 2, we describe the probability of SMG and ANG activation separately according to both the binary and rating based classifications. In these supplementary analyses, the factors affecting the probability of right IPL activation in the primary analyses were also associated with the probability of activation of both right IPL subregions. The more subtle and noisy effects in the left IPL (see estimates and \u03c7  values, reasons for this additional noise are explored in the discussion) were not observed in the left IPL subregions with the limited power available (average 40% decrease in activation frequency) for these analyses. \n\nWe further explored the extent of the hemispheric lateralisation of IPL function by assessing whether unilateral activations were more probable than bilateral activations for semantically- and perceptually-defined memory retrieval. Multiple regression models assessed this probability according to the same factors described in the main analyses (i.e., the contrast\u2019s classification [semantic\/perceptual, binary and 1\u20135 rating based classifications], the stimulus type, the year of publication, and the stringency of multiple comparison correction). Both types of information content classification produced models of unilateral left IPL activation probability that were better than a comparable null model (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200917.86,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.37; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200926.10,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.28). In each of these models, semantically-defined memory retrieval contrasts were more likely than perceptually-defined contrasts to produce unilateral left IPL activations rather than bilateral activations (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200931.35,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20093.65; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u200921.73,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20091.20). Our assessment of the probability of unilateral right IPL activity revealed that only the model including our proportion-based classification of semantic\/perceptual information content explained significantly more variance than a comparable null model (Binary\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u20096.96,   p  \u2009>\u2009.05, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.15; Ratings\u2014\u03c7 (\u2212\u20095)\u2009=\u200911.15,   p  \u2009=\u2009.048, pseudo-R \u2009=\u20090.23). In the proportion-based classification, right IPL activation was significantly more likely to be unilateral than bilateral with contrasts increasingly defined as more perceptual than semantic (\u03c7 (1)\u2009=\u20099.91,   p  \u2009<\u2009.01,   M  \u2009=\u20091.11). These results provide strong evidence that rather than one type of information content being lateralised to one hemisphere and the other being associated with bilateral activations, semantic and perceptually-defined memory experiences are associated with left and right lateralised IPL activation respectively. Moreover it suggests that bilateral activations are produced by the presence of both types of information content in a memory experience. Full details of these analyses are presented in Supplementary Analysis 3. \n\nThe coordinates of all IPL activations associated with each contrast were recorded, and those contrasts that were given a clear semantic\/conceptual classification (ratings 1 and 2, 64 contrasts) or a clear perceptual classification (ratings 4 and 5, 38 contrasts) are mapped onto an inflated template brain shown in Fig.\u00a0 A using the Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Analysis & Visualization Tool (MMVT ). \n\nAs well as classifying fMRI contrasts according to the dominant informational content for each contrast (perceptual or semantic), we also explored whether hemispheric specialisation in the IPL differed according to whether recollection and familiarity memory processing predominated. Direct comparisons are presented here because the limited availability of data in some classifications prevented the regression models from converging on reliable estimates, precluding the factor from inclusion in the analyses. With respect to semantic contrasts, we observed that recall or recollection-based retrieval produced left IPL activations in 96% (27 of 28) of eligible contrasts, whereas the right IPL was only active in 29% of these contrasts (8\/28). Semantically defined familiarity memory contrasts displayed the same lateralisation as recollection; the left IPL displayed activation in 100% of these contrasts (12\/12), compared with only 33% (4\/12) showing right IPL activation. With respect to perceptual contrasts, 91% (20\/22) of those involving recollection displayed right IPL activation, while left IPL activation was found in 77% (17\/22) of these contrasts. Perceptually defined familiarity memory produced bilateral IPL activations in all 3 relevant contrasts (100%). However, this should be interpreted with great caution due to the small number of data points. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis review has identified a clear relationship between the hemispheric lateralisation of IPL activations and the informational nature of the target memory in fMRI investigations of episodic retrieval. Our findings suggest that the left IPL supports the retrieval of the semantic and conceptual aspects of episodic memory, whereas the right IPL supports in the retrieval of the perceptual features of a memory, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 A. Moreover, the information content of the memory provides a more accurate and complete account of IPL specialisation than the type of stimulus being remembered (e.g. words or images). Hemispheric specialisation in the IPL is well established in both the spatial attention  and language processing  literatures, and the lateralisation pattern we have observed here, whilst produced by different cognitive processes, is highly compatible with this previous work. Whilst clearly recognising the potential anatomic distinction in the IPL between the systems dedicated to different areas of cognitive function , the information content interpretation links the brain mechanisms that support memory retrieval, with those that underpin spatial attention and language processes. \n\nThere are studies that offer a particularly clear insight into the hemispheric specialisation of memory retrieval function in the IPL. Some studies specifically focus on semantically-defined memory experiences and report unilateral left hemisphere IPL activations. For example, Frithsen and Miller  presented participants with noun words and encouraged their encoding using a semantic judgement task. This study reported source recognition related activation in a highly left-hemisphere lateralised network of cortical regions that included the left IPL. Other studies focus specifically on perceptually-defined memory experiences and report unilateral right hemisphere IPL activations. For example, St-Laurent and colleagues  contrasted perceptually rich video clips with minimal dialog with perceptually impoverished narrations of the same events, and Klostermann and colleagues  tested the memory of participants using non-verbal, agrammatical music stimuli. Both studies reported activation of the right, but not left IPL. Interestingly, Dobbins & Wagner  provided an interesting comparison of the episodic retrieval mechanisms associated with semantic and perceptual source memories. A recognition contrast in which subjects recollected items that were encoded with a semantic judgement revealed left hemisphere lateralised activations of the IPL and other nodes of the core recollection network. In contrast, recollection of perceptual features of the memory was associated with comparable areas exclusively in the right hemisphere. The lateralisations described here are typical of those reported in our classifications. \n\nAs might be expected, a large number of contrasts (67\/121) showed some bilateral activation of the IPL. We observed strong evidence indicating that, compared with bilateral activations, unilateral IPL activation was more probable in the left hemisphere during semantically-defined memory retrieval and in the right hemisphere during perceptually-defined memory retrieval. We therefore propose that the large number of bilateral activations reflect the presence of both perceptual and semantic information in the retrieved episode; illustrating a characteristic richness of memory that is common to so many episodic memories but is rarely investigated. We analysed the relationship between this memory content and IPL activity from studies across a period of almost twenty years. Many, and particularly early, fMRI experiments have used word stimuli, probably because of the comparative ease with which they could be developed, manipulated, and presented. This accounts for the greater number of contrasts categorised as requiring the retrieval of semantic rather than perceptual information in our analysis (76 semantic contrasts, mean year of publication\u2009=\u20092010, SD\u2009=\u20096\u00a0years, compared with 45 perceptual contrasts, mean year of publication\u2009=\u20092013, SD\u2009=\u20095\u00a0years, see Supplementary Table   &  ). The targeted investigation of the effects of specific kinds of memory retrieval process, (e.g., familiarity), has developed more recently, and this has likely contributed to the surprisingly limited data points on perceptually-based familiarity. \n\nThe angular gyrus is both a subregion of the inferior parietal lobule and a node of the default mode network (DMN) and it exhibits activation with a huge variety of tasks. Interestingly, three functional subregions within the left angular gyrus have been identified . Two of these left-sided subregions have been implicated in a DMN role, where their activity changed in all tasks relative to fixation (increase in dorsomedial angular gyrus activity, decrease in middle angular gyrus activity). However, in the ventrolateral angular gyrus, activity specifically changed with a semantic matching task. Interestingly, a more recent study exploring functional connectivity during episodic retrieval, revealed substantial connectivity between the left angular gyrus and other non-medial temporal cortex nodes of the DMN . In contrast, the right angular gyrus exhibited strong retrieval-related functional connectivity with the medial temporal lobe. Consistent with the research highlighted in this discussion, our targeted review of IPL activations, strongly suggests that the right IPL performs a particularly important functional role in episodic retrieval that until now has lacked widespread appreciation. \n\nMany recognition memory tasks require very little retrieval of the perceptual features of an encoding experience. For example, in a recognition memory paradigm, if we have conceptual memory that a glass of beer was encoded, then remembering precisely what the beer looked like is not critical to its recognition when the beer is presented alongside an apple. Instead, the retrieval of semantic concepts is often sufficient for accurate recognition memory. Therefore, in many of the studies that observe IPL retrieval effects, semantic\/conceptual memory alone could support accurate recognition performance. For example, the traditional Yes\/No memory task has not utilised similar lures at test as standard. As a result, the representations of encoded and new items are generally semantically very different and can be successfully distinguished by a simple semantic label for each encoded target. As the hippocampus plays a key role in supporting associative memory , it is likely to support the accurate associative retrieval of semantic labels and concepts encountered in a specific encoding context without drawing critically on the IPL. This may explain why patients with IPL lesions do not appear amnesic when assessed with many traditional memory techniques. \n\nLeft hemisphere IPL activations associated with episodic memory retrieval are observed with greater frequency than right IPL activations. We suggest that this difference in frequency of lateralisation reflects the contents of episodic retrieval rather than the selective specialisation of the left IPL for memory retrieval. Additionally, the left IPL is associated with greater connectivity with the DMN than the right IPL . As a result, DMN-related activity that is associated with a factor outside of experimental control, e.g. variability in arousal\/task engagement, may elicit left but not right IPL activity and be misattributed as demonstrating specific differences in memory processing between the hemispheres. Unfortunately, the potentially inflated frequency of left IPL activity by DMN functions combined with a lack of focus on the role of the right IPL in memory retrieval has led many recent investigations of IPL memory function to focus solely on the left IPL . This has occurred at the expense of a targeted exploration of the functional role of the right IPL, potentially obscuring the observation of key findings. \n\nIn contrast to those many memory paradigms that can be successfully completed through the retrieval of semantic or conceptual details of an episode, other memory tasks can only be completed through the retrieval of detailed perceptual information from memory. Recognition tasks that use a target and highly similar lures (e.g., four apples) have this requirement . In such tasks, retrieving the label of an object (e.g., apple) does not help the participant to distinguish the target from other similar variants of the same object. Indeed evidence of right hemisphere IPL activations has been observed with this type of task . Dennis et al  .  , used related lures (items within a semantic category, e.g., different cats) and showed greater activity in the right angular gyrus for remember false alarms (recall of some, but not diagnostic, perceptual features) than non-remember false alarms (including guesses). In another study utilising similar lures, the right angular gyrus showed a large activation cluster that was greater for correct rejection (retrieval of perceptual features to reject\/detect novelty) than false alarm responses . \n\nInterestingly, causal studies, utilising patients and neurostimulation techniques, have shown evidence of a functional role of the IPL in the retrieval of perceptual experiences . In contrast to memory for semantic\/conceptual labels, these studies required retrieval and integration of multiple perceptual features. For example, Davidson et al. , observed that this kind of memory retrieval was impaired in patients with lateral parietal cortex lesions. More specifically, perceptual details of autobiographical recall were reduced despite preserved descriptions of non-specific semantic details. In addition, the patients produced fewer \u2018remember\u2019 responses during a remember\/know recognition task. Simons et al  .  , observed that during a recognition memory task, memory confidence but not accuracy, was reduced in patients with IPL damage. Although this was interpreted as an impairment of subjective memory in these patients, a reduction in their objective memory for the perceptual details of these recollections, although not tested, may also explain this effect. Of note, Russell et al  .   recently reported that individuals with right hemisphere IPL damage and without unilateral hemispatial neglect symptoms were specifically impaired in recalling their self-perspective at encoding. Contrastingly, these individuals could recall other information about the episode that could be summarised with a label , potentially enabling functional compensation by the left hemisphere\u2019s IPL. These studies all suggest that perceptual feature information is more susceptible than semantic\/conceptual information to memory impairment when IPL function is compromised. The idea that memory retrieval is dynamically modulated by the engagement of the IPL was recently corroborated by examples of augmented memory retrieval abilities following up-regulation of left angular gyrus activity with TMS . Critically, further work should utilise the upregulating TMS approach developed in the lab of Voss and colleagues  with the right hemisphere\u2019s angular gyrus and establish whether this modulates the balance of the retrieval of semantic and\/or perceptual aspects of memory. \n\nAdditional causal support for the hemispheric specialisation of IPL processing being dependent on information content is provided by the effect of parietal lesions on different types of paired recall. Levy and colleagues  observed that angular gyrus lesions in particular were associated with pronounced deficits in perceptually-defined memory recall. Moreover, patients with right hemisphere parietal damage and perceptually-defined memory impairments retained, or potentially even improved, their semantically-defined recall abilities (Fig.\u00a08 of  ). The findings of the current meta-analysis, which are not affected by the confounding effects of encoding impairments caused by aphasia and unilateral hemispatial neglect (extremely common in the patient lesion studies of the parietal cortex), together with the data of Levy and colleagues, strongly support the idea of semantic compensation by the left hemisphere\u2019s parietal cortex for deficits in perceptual retrieval. \n\nThe data presented here suggest that the retrieval of memory based on either recollection or familiarity, both exhibit the same pattern of IPL hemispheric specialisation driven by informational content. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the \u201ccortical binding of relational activity\u201d (COBRA)  model and the very similar Contextual Integration Model  of IPL memory function. These models propose that multifaceted information arising from memory is integrated by the IPL during memory retrieval . Whilst these hypotheses offer explanations of memory supported by recollection, they fail to effectively integrate the findings of previous research that has observed IPL activations associated with familiarity-based recognition . In the case of familiarity, incoming information is compared to a stored representation and unlike recollection, does not involve the retrieval of additional information from the study context . As a result, integration of memory components should not be required for familiarity memory. The hypothesis proposed by the episodic buffer model, and more recently adopted into the PUCC framework , states that any output from the MTL (familiarity or recollection) is likely to be temporally or spatially incongruent with the current context and that the IPL works to adapt the information to fit this context. Therefore, it would be interesting if future work directly investigated the effect of manipulating perceptually and semantically defined information content on familiarity memory experiences. Finally, it will be important for future models and frameworks of IPL function to also ensure that activations caused by, and impairments in, recollection and familiarity for both semantically and perceptually-defined memory information are accounted for and explained. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, this review proposes a novel characterisation of the IPL processing involved in the retrieval of rich everyday episodic memories. For the first time, we provide compelling evidence that the IPL of the two hemispheres perform similar but functionally dissociable roles in the retrieval of a complete episodic memory. The left IPL supports the retrieval of the semantic and conceptual aspects of episodic memory, whereas the right IPL supports the retrieval of the perceptual features of the memory. We also provide evidence that this relationship is not driven by differences between types of retrieval process (i.e., recall\/recollection or familiarity) or simply by the type of stimulus originally encoded (i.e., words or images) but instead, is driven specifically by mnemonic informational content. \n\nNeuroimaging studies frequently report activation in the IPL across a variety of cognitive functions. Despite these numerous reports and the prevalence of IPL damage in patients with lesions (e.g. stroke) and disease (e.g. dementia), our understanding of its causal role has been limited by a lack of appreciation of those characteristics (e.g. hemispheric specialisation) which are common across cognitive functions. Future work should develop novel and more convergent approaches that utilise the methodological strengths derived from investigating these different cognitive domains. Moreover, it is crucial for a complete understanding of this area, that studies involving the direct modulation of brain activity (e.g. through TMS), target and compare effects of stimulation on   both   hemispheres. Only through this type of careful and strategic investigation, and the use of highly specified and controlled informational content, will we fully understand both the shared and selective roles of the IPL across different cognitive domains. Apart from informing a crucial area of neuroscientific knowledge, this work will be central to realising the enormous potential of therapeutically modulating IPL activity to improve function in the damaged and diseased brain. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7493939,"text_md5":"bb5002fea9a6fad236cff0bec7a09987","field_positions":{"authors":[0,49],"journal":[50,57],"publication_year":[59,63],"title":[74,187],"keywords":[201,225],"abstract":[238,1386],"body":[1395,40676]},"batch":3,"pmid":32934326,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-020-72228-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493939","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7493939"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493939\">7493939<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7493939  Information content best characterises the hemispheric selectivity of the inferior parietal lobe: a meta-analysis"}

M.\nPLoS One, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nA systematic review and activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the central innervation of the lower urinary tract: Pelvic floor motor control and micturition\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Purpose \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging is a powerful and versatile tool to investigate central lower urinary tract (LUT) control. Despite the increasing body of literature there is a lack of comprehensive overviews on LUT control. Thus, we aimed to execute a coordinate based meta-analysis of all PET and fMRI evidence on descending central LUT control, i.e. pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC) and micturition. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nA systematic literature search of all relevant libraries was performed in August 2020. Coordinates of activity were extracted from eligible studies to perform an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) using a threshold of uncorrected p <0.001. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n20 of 6858 identified studies, published between 1997 and 2020, were included. Twelve studies investigated PFMC (1xPET, 11xfMRI) and eight micturition (3xPET, 5xfMRI). The PFMC ALE analysis (n = 181, 133 foci) showed clusters in the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus, thalamus, supramarginal gyrus, and cerebellum. The micturition ALE analysis (n = 107, 98 foci) showed active clusters in the dorsal pons, including the pontine micturition center, the periaqueductal gray, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula and ventral pons. Overlap of PFMC and micturition was found in the cingulate gyrus and thalamus. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nFor the first time the involved core brain areas of LUT motor control were determined using ALE. Furthermore, the involved brain areas for PFMC and micturition are partially distinct. Further neuroimaging studies are required to extend this ALE analysis and determine the differences between a healthy and a dysfunctional LUT. This requires standardization of protocols and task-execution. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe neuronal control of the lower urinary tract is based on multilevel circuits, i.e. peripheral nerves, autonomic ganglia, spinal cord pathways, and supraspinal centers [ ]. The latter allow for the voluntary control and proper coordination of LUT function including synergic micturition (that is, bladder neck and external urethral sphincter relaxation during detrusor contraction) [ \u2013 ]. \n\nFunctional neuroimaging is a powerful and versatile tool to investigate the neural structures and processes involved in central lower urinary tract (LUT) control. The LUT motor control is usually only perceived as storage and micturition (detrusor control as autonomous activity), but the descending LUT control also includes voluntary, conscious pelvic floor muscle contractions (PFMC). Voluntary PFMC are a proxy for, but not the same as, the involuntary tonic contraction employed during the storage phase. Especially since PFMC tends to be a voluntary \u201cbackup\u201d mechanism which is employed during very strong urge to void or defecate. Despite the increasing body of literature, publications are scattered among various medical disciplines and there is a lack of comprehensive overview on the descending central LUT control [ \u2013 ]. Hence, it would be of great interest to get a structured overview on this topic and determine the most relevant brain areas involved in LUT motor control. This is of importance for a better understanding of the composition of supraspinal LUT control networks and to be able to distinguish between networks involved in healthy control as opposed to LUT dysfunction. This would contribute to elucidate the pathophysiology of some highly prevalent diseases within functional urology, like overactive and underactive bladder (OAB\/UAB), bladder pain syndrome (BPS) and dysfunctional voiding. \n\nA well-established approach to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) of the existing neuroimaging data in order to achieve a comprehensive overview of the relevant brain regions involved in functional tasks of interest is Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis [ ]. ALE analyses determine the statistical probability of brain regions being consistently activated during a specific task. \n\nThe aim of the present systematic review is to summarize the existing evidence on the supraspinal motor control of the LUT in humans, i.e. micturition and PFMC, and to determine in an exploratory fashion the core brain areas involved in these functions using ALE. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study registration \n  \nThis systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016047488  ). \n\n\n### Literature search \n  \nA systematic search of all relevant publications was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. A search was conducted including all publications until August 2020,   contains the used search terms. Manual reference checks of accepted papers in recent reviews and included papers were performed as supplement to the electronic search. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nAll original publications on neuroimaging of lower urinary tract control in humans were eligible for full-text retrieval. \n\nThe use of a comprehensive search strategy resulted in a highly heterogeneous body of data which included a variety of neuroimaging techniques, populations, settings and protocols. In order to optimally utilize this extensive literature search, it was decided to split the extracted studies into smaller components addressing more concise research questions to get more precise answers. The current review focused on the assessment of LUT motor control using PET and fMRI. Therefore literature concerning PFMC or micturition using other neuroimaging techniques like diffusion MRI (tractography), DTI, NIRS, SPECT was excluded. \n\nHence, inclusion criteria were studies using fMRI or PET when performing micturition or pelvic floor muscle contractions that described the coordinates (in stereotactic space i.e. Talaraich (TAL) or MNI) of active clusters found during the performed task. Duplicates, abstracts only, conference proceedings, non-English text publications, non-human research and reviews were excluded. \n\n\n### Selection of studies \n  \nTitles and abstracts were screened in Endnote (EndNote X9; Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA, USA) by U.M. and B.B. and discrepancies were resolved by I.G. The selected articles were full text screened for eligibility by J.G. and I.G. using a standardized screening form, and discrepancies were discussed and resolved by a third reviewer (B.B.). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe data were independently extracted from the included full-text publications by two reviewers (J.G. and I.G.) using a standardized form. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by the third reviewer (B.B.). Data extracted were: general descriptive information of the studies, sample sizes, study population, characteristics describing the scanning protocol, applied analysis and the reported coordinates of supraspinal activity (raw data). \n\n\n### Raw data \n  \nThe extracted raw data were the coordinates of the activated clusters described by the included studies. The coordinates are shown in the orientation in which they were originally described, i.e. MNI or TAL. Most included studies focusing on micturition, separately reported the coordinates of the patients with successful micturition and unsuccessful micturition. The current study only extracted the coordinates of the subjects with successful micturition if the data was reported separately. In two studies the distinction between successful and unsuccessful micturition was not made. \n\n\n### Primary outcome: Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) \n  \nCoordinate-based meta-analyses of neuroimaging results were performed using GingerALE software (version 2.3.6) available on the BrainMap website ( ). ALE analysis uses all the reported foci from the included studies as a spatial probability distribution centered at the given coordinates. The analysis accommodates the spatial uncertainty of neuroimaging findings and uses a spatial variance model. Finally, the convergence of foci is tested against the null-hypothesis of random distribution of foci, creating the ALE score for each cluster. The TAL coordinates were converted to MNI space using the icbm2tal transform within the GingerALE software [ ]. A lenient threshold was used, taking the amount of data subjects into account (uncorrected p <0.001, minimal Volume of 100 mm ). Results were presented on an MNI template using Mango, multi-image viewing software ( ). \n\n\n### Risk of bias assessment \n  \nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool together with an assessment of the main confounders following recommendations of the Cochrane handbook for nonrandomized comparative studies [ , ] were used to perform a risk of bias analysis for included nonrandomized comparative studies. Firstly, a manual was developed for scoring the added confounders. Secondly, the main and added confounders were independently scored by two authors (J.G. and I.G.) and discrepancies were discussed.   shows the used confounders and how they were scored. \n   Scoring manual for the confounders in the risk of bias assessment.      \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe PRISMA flow diagram in   shows the results of the literature search and the study selection.

Study characteristics of PET studies.        \n\n### Raw data \n  \n#### Pelvic floor muscle contraction \n  \nTwelve studies investigated active brain areas during PFMC. One of them [ ] did this using PET, the others all used fMRI. \n\nOf these 12 studies, 9 found active clusters in the primary motor cortex (M1), either in the right or left hemicortex, or both. Seven studies found activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Some studies reported activation in the frontal lobe, with coordinates widespread through the frontal lobe. The putamen showed active clusters in 4 studies, the thalamus and the insula both showed active clusters in 6 studies. Active clusters in the cerebellum were described in 9 studies.   shows the coordinates of all brain areas that have been consistently found in at least 3 of the included studies. If, in a single study, more than one cluster was identified in the same brain area, the cluster with the highest T- or Z-value is displayed in  . All active clusters described in individual studies only, are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### Micturition \n  \nEight studies investigated brain areas involved in micturition, of which 5 used fMRI and 3 used PET. The study of Kuhtz-Buschbeck et al. 2009 [ ], investigated initiation of voiding only, i.e. participants prevented voiding by contracting the pelvic floor when micturition was about to start, all other studies investigated real micturition. Only in the study of Khavari et al. data of patients with successful micturition (n = 7) and unsuccessful micturition (n = 9) were not reported separately. In four studies, patients could sign (hand or vocally) when they were about to start micturition [ \u2013 ]. Two studies used a flow\/urine detector to detect the start of micturition [ , ] and in two studies patients were instructed when to start micturition [ , ]. Six studies found activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and 5 in the dorsal pons, including pontine micturition center (PMC). Cingulate gyrus was active in 6 studies. The insula, the thalamus, the mid frontal gyrus and the cerebellum were activated in 4 studies. The inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 11, 44\u201347) was found active in all studies.   shows peak coordinates of brain areas that were reported to be active in at least 3 of the included studies. If, in a single study, more than one cluster was found in the same brain area, the cluster with the highest T- or Z-value is displayed in  . All other active clusters described in individual studies only, are summarized in  . \n\n\n\n### Primary outcome: Activation likelihood estimation \n  \n#### Pelvic floor muscle contraction \n  \nThe ALE analysis of 133 peak coordinates derived from 12 different studies with a total number of 181 subjects of which 74 men and 95 women (all cluster\/peak coordinates summarized in   and   Tables) yielded 10 active clusters using a statistical threshold of p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100 mm  ( ).   displays several of the ALE clusters: primary motor cortex, SMA, cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, substantia nigra\/red nucleus and the cerebellum. \n   Results of the ALE analysis pelvic floor muscle contraction (p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100m ).  \n1 : Primary motor cortex, 1 : Mid cingulate gyrus, 1 : Supplementary motor area, 2: Thalamus left, 3: Supramarginal gyrus right, 5: Substantia Nigra, 6: Red nucleus, 7: Thalamus right, 8: Cerebellum left, 9: SUpramarginal gyrus left. \n     ALE results of PFMC and micturition tasks.        \n\n#### Micturition \n  \nThe ALE analyses of 98 peak coordinates derived from 8 different studies with a total number of 107 subjects of which 48 men and 59 women (all peak coordinates summarized in   and   Tables) yielded 7 active peak activations\/clusters using a statistical threshold of p = 0.001 uncorrected with a minimal cluster size of 100 mm  ( ).   displays exemplarily several of the ALE clusters: PMC, PAG, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus and insula.

Furthermore, ALE-analysis enabled us to extract from all raw data across studies the most commonly and reproducibly activated supraspinal areas involved in LUT motor control. \n\n### Pelvic floor muscle contraction \n  \n shows that most studies found active clusters in some obvious brain areas involved in pelvic floor motor control, e.g. M1 and SMA. Unexpectedly, three of the studies did not find activation in the M1 [ , , ] and 5 studies did not find activation in the SMA [ , , , ], but all studies found activation in either M1 or SMA. Schrum et al. did not find activation in M1. They used a cytoarchitectonic map [ ] to detect that more than 80% of the active cluster found in the medial wall belonged to the SMA. The authors argued that activation in the M1 would have been detected using a more liberal threshold [ ]. Several human and non-human primate studies have revealed a somatotopic organization of the SMA [ \u2013 ], and showed that the activated areas of the face, the upper limb, and the lower limb were located from anterior to posterior, respectively. This would indicate that activation in the SMA during PFMC might lie in the posterior part of the SMA, which is close to the somatotopic location of activation in the primary motor cortex during PFMC. Furthermore, Di Gangi Herms et al. showed that, after a training interval of 12 weeks regular PFMCs, the number of activated voxels on the SMA decreased significantly compared to before PFMCs training [ ]. This demonstrated that the SMA plays an important role in unconditioned motor tasks, like PFMC. Thus, PFMC being an unconditioned task might induce the appearance of large clusters on SMA, and together with its orientation in the posterior SMA, these clusters might be indistinguishable from activation in M1. This could be an explanation for the incongruent findings of the different studies on M1 or SMA. \n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to confirm the involved brain areas in pelvic floor motor control using an ALE-analysis ( ), namely the: M1, SMA, prefrontal cortex (BA 6 & 9), cingulate gyrus, thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Putamen activation however, was found in 4 of the included studies [ , , , ], but not in our ALE analysis. A possible explanation might be that the coordinates of the peak activations are spread across the putamen and that this did not result in the formation of a cluster in the ALE analysis. The role of the putamen in LUT control has been confirmed earlier, as this structure plays an important role in the corticostriatal pathway which participates in motor action selection and coordination [ ]. \n\nThe ALE analysis revealed two clusters (# 7 and #8) covering the substantia nigra and the red nucleus: parts of the basal ganglia involved in motor tasks [ ]. Two studies contributed to the formation of these clusters in the ALE analysis [ , ]. \n\n\n### Micturition \n  \nMicturition is a complex process, involving both voluntary and involuntary control regulated by a supraspinal network [ , ]. Until 1996, all available evidence for supraspinal micturition control was obtained from animal studies in cats [ ] or from case reports of humans with lesions in the prefrontal cortex [ ]. Blok et al. were the first to show brain activation in humans during micturition using PET [ , ]. However, the evidence in humans is still limited, possibly due to the fact that this LUT motor task is complicated to study. This is caused by several reasons; 1) In case of BOLD fMRI, repeated captures of the event-related data are necessary to obtain a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which is hard to establish considering the complex (autonomic and somatic) control of micturition, 2) Involved brain areas lie relatively closely to each other in the brainstem (PMC\/PAG\/thalamus); distinguishing these areas requires high resolution imaging, 3) A significant number of subjects are not able to void in the scanner, possibly due to the involvement of the prefrontal cortex involved in decision making in social context [ ]. The current study describes all PET and fMRI evidence for supraspinal micturition control and included 8 studies with a total of 107 subjects.   shows all raw data obtained in the last three decades. Using ALE analysis, this study evaluated all evidence and confirmed the involvement of these key brain areas during micturition: the PMC, the PAG, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, the insula and the cerebellum. Cluster 1 is a merged cluster covering the thalamus, PAG, PMC and the cerebellum. It has three obvious peak activations in the thalamus, PAG and PMC as shown in  . The dorsal pons includes the PMC and the ventral pons includes the pontine continence or storage center [ , ]. These current findings are in line with previous working models on the supraspinal networks supposed to be involved in micturition [ ]. \n\n and   Tables show that all studies found multiple active clusters diffuse across the prefrontal cortex. Peak activations were found in all Brodmann areas within the prefrontal cortex, most of which were located in Brodmann areas 9 and 44. Both areas (the medial prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal cortex) have been described previously to be involved in micturition [ , ]. The variability of the exact activity location within these areas may result from the variety of different protocols applied in the included studies. The prefrontal cortex has strong connections with other limbic structures\u2013the hypothalamus, amygdala, insula and cingulate gyrus and is known to be involved in the planning of complex cognitive behavior and appropriate social behavior [ ]. The voluntary decision when to void is generated in the prefrontal cortex in turn sending efferent signals via the cingulate to the PAG and PMC [ ]. The ALE analysis did not show an active cluster in the hypothalamus. However, two of the included studies did find such a cluster as shown in   [ , ]. As the hypothalamus is part of the limbic system, its role in micturition has been described before [ ]. The size of the area is rather small, making detection of active clusters challenging. \n\n\n### Micturition vs PFMC \n  \nThis systematic review studies the motor control of the LUT, consisting of one voluntary controlled task (PFMC) and one semi-voluntary controlled task (micturition). Although PFMC and micturition are both motor tasks of the LUT, they have completely different goals. Micturition is a complex coordinated process between the urinary bladder and the external urethral sphincter that aims to empty the bladder periodically, whereas PFMC is a more confined motor task. The latter attribute makes PMFC less complicated to study which may attract more attention and explain the larger number of PFMC studies compared to micturition studies despite it is only a part of the micturition cycle. PFMC concerns the voluntary (M1) contraction on top of the involuntary tonic contraction of the urethral sphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence. The minimal overlap of activated brain areas was therefore expected and demonstrates this distinct working mechanism of the supraspinal organization of both tasks. Comparison of the results shows that only two clusters overlap: midcingulate gyrus (MCG) and the left thalamus. The important role of the MCG in reward-based decision making has been described before [ ], and involvement of this area was expected in both LUT motor tasks. The involvement of the basal ganglia was also expected in both tasks. The thalamocortical pathway is important in execution of motor tasks [ ]. But, the thalamus is also involved in interoceptive networks, and is therefore important in initiation of micturition [ ]. \n\nPFMC can be studied during different bladder states (empty vs full), sometimes used to interrupt micturition or suppress the urge to void. In the PFMC ALE, 5 studies investigated PFMC with a full bladder [ , , , , ]. Among those, Zhang et al, compared activation between PFMC with empty vs full bladder and demonstrated differences in SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum. This might be of great interest towards the clinical applicability of fMRI in patient populations. To better understand the influence of bladder status on pelvic floor control, further studies comparing results at different bladder states are necessary. \n\nAlthough the current meta-analysis did not specifically focus on sex related differences, data of both men and women were included. Tables   and   demonstrate that only three studies (2 PFMC and 1 micturition) in this review studied both men and women [ , , ]. The amount of data in the current systematic review was not sufficient to repeat the ALE analysis separately for men and women to study differences. The studies that included both men and women did compare the results between men and women. Moreover, the study of Seseke et al. focused specifically on this topic in relation to micturition comparing their male results with previous female results [ ]. In PFMC, no sex related differences were found [ ], however, in another study about external anal sphincter contraction, greater activity was found in men [ ]. Various arguments for this difference are described, like a more forceful contraction in men, the obvious anatomical differences between the genitourinary system or a general interhemispheric asymmetry of the human motor cortex related to sexes [ , , ]. In micturition, stronger task related activity in the right thalamus and other right-hemispherical regions was found in women compared to men [ ]. Still, results on this topic are scarce and very heterogeneous. Other studies speculate that women have a stronger brain activity during visceral stimulation than men [ , ]. \n\n\n### Clinical implications & reliability \n  \nCompared to the pre-neuroimaging-era, when knowledge of LUT control was mainly based on animal studies which provided a relevant basis to understand particularly spinal and brain stem structures and circuits involved in LUT control [ \u2013 ], cortical and subcortical processes in human LUT control were largely unknown. Advances in neuroimaging allowed us to progressively explore this field and to learn which brain areas are involved in human LUT control and how they may be connected. This is of specific value considering that certain LUT diseases such as OAB occur in humans only. In addition, chronic LUT dysfunction may lead to alterations in suprapinal processing of LUT afferent and efferent signaling that itself contribute to or maintain the LUT dysfunction. Therefore, such alterations should be known and understood to improve treatment strategies and to advance the evaluation of treatments targeting suprapinal signal processing such as neuromodulative therapies. This current review and meta-analysis for the first time describes the key brain areas of all previous investigations on LUT motor control, i.e. PFMC and micturition. Knowing the key brain areas and their involvement in different tasks, i.e. PFMC vs micturition, it is important to address new and more specific research questions, to plan according neuroimaging studies, and to address targets for neurofeedback therapy [ ]. Specifically interesting in this regard is that our findings clearly demonstrate that the voluntary motor control of PFMC involves typical cortical motor control areas such as M1 and SMA whereas the autonomic detrusor motor control involves brain stem activity, i.e. PAG and PMC, instead. One of the brain areas that is involved in both motor tasks is the cerebellum which seems to play a more relevant role in LUT motor control than previously expected. \n\nSince our knowledge about the physiology of the innervation of the LUT has grown, lately more research is focusing on the results of neuroimaging in patients with LUT disorders, like chronic pelvic pain syndrome [ ], stress urinary incontinence (SUI) [ ], urge urinary incontinence [ , ] or multiple sclerosis (MS) [ , ]. Khavari et al [ ], studied differences in activation after onabotulinumA injections in patients with UUI and MS compared to healthy controls. It was demonstrated that during full urge, patients with UUI and MS show more deactivations compared to healthy controls in cortical and subcortical structures. After onabotulinumA injections, the brain responses were more in agreement with those of healthy controls. Furthermore, a study of Griffiths et al [ ]. clearly demonstrated an increased activation in patients with full bladder and UUI compared to healthy controls, particularly in the cingulate gyrus, SMA and prefrontal cortex. What these studies suggest, is that when patients react to therapy, activation patterns had more similarities with those of healthy controls, which is a very usable finding in future implication of fMRI [ , , , \u2013 ]. In the current ALE analysis, two studies were included with a patient population instead of healthy controls. One micturition related study included patients with MS [ ] and one PFMC related study included patients with SUI [ ]. Both ALE analyses (PFMC and micturition) were repeated without inclusion of the patient data to assess the influence on the outcome. Only the amount of clusters changed (the ones with the lowest ALE values disappeared), however, most probably due to the lower number of included subjects in the ALE analysis which is critical for the validity of such analysis and hampers a reasonable interpretation of these differences from a statistical point of view. As visible in the raw data in the supplements, both studies including patient data do not show remarkable outliers, or other distinguishing results compared to the studies including healthy volunteers. \n\nStudying differences in supraspinal activation patterns between healthy controls and patients is important for future clinical implications of neuroimaging and the search towards finding the pathophysiology of diseases within functional urology. The SMA, cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex have been independently described as areas of interest when evaluating differences between patients and healthy controls, full or empty bladder and effect of therapies [ , , , \u2013 ]. \n\nDespite that ALE values cannot be directly compared between different datasets due to the given heterogeneity of the original studies included in the datasets, they still provide a good estimate which brain areas may be more relevant for specific LUT tasks or more consistently activated in states of LUT dysfunction. To allow a meaningful ALE meta-analysis on the differences between healthy controls and patients we would need more original studies that statistically compare both groups, i.e. patients and healthy controls, and provide data (e.g. coordinates) on the group differences that can be included into the meta-analysis. Alternatively, using a rather new approach which aims to compare separate ALE maps of different data sets from healthy controls and patients [ ], we would need a larger number of studies investigating healthy controls and patients with a similar total amount of subjects and using same or similar task and imaging protocols. Currently, there are only few functional neuroimaging studies on patients with LUT dysfunction and those studies comparing results to healthy controls do this descriptively only. \n\nThe ability of the ALE meta-analysis to elicit relevant brain areas involved in the execution of specific tasks as demonstrated for micturition and PFMT is particularly valuable in the current stage of neuroimaging research in functional urology where mainly whole brain analyses are performed which provide a good overview but may also generate a lot of noise and less relevant secondary activity, specifically when applying lower statistical thresholds (e.g. uncorrected thresholds or voxel-level FDR) to detect any LUT related activity. Here, ALE meta-analysis can help to keep the focus by determining the more consistently involved areas and subsequently also to better specify study hypotheses and designs of future neuroimaging experiments. \n\nCertainly, functional neuroimaging studies on bladder-brain control are a big challenge in many aspects and current study designs and imaging parameters may still be not optimal which may be at least partly reflected by a rather poor reliability [ , ]. Nevertheless, to advance evidence in this field and since validity of ALE analysis depends on the data amount and quality [ , ] more effort is needed to provide such data. \n\nTwo aspects appear relevant for this endeavor: a) validation of task and imaging parameters to better understand and control for measurement related bias and to be able to apply higher statistical thresholds. b) correlation of neuroimaging findings to clinical outcomes to better understand the relation between supraspinal activity patterns and dysfunction or symptoms. To better compare between or pool studies, harmonization of protocols (including measures for prevention of movement artefacts, specifically eye movements) and terminology would be of great advantage [ ]. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe current systematic review and ALE analysis makes all raw data available and creates a clear overview of fMRI and PET imaging of the supraspinal control of the LUT. Our liberal search strategy additionally allowed a very comprehensive review. Nevertheless, there are limitations. This systematic review only included studies using the neuroimaging techniques fMRI or PET, since these techniques yield reliable coordinated-based results, usable for the ALE analysis. Data of other neuroimaging techniques apart from fMRI and PET was therefore not included. Furthermore, to perform a valid ALE analysis and reach sufficient power, the amount of included data is important, which is a criticizable point in the current ALE analysis [ ]. However, within the urological field the amount of neuroimaging data is still limited making the use of a liberal threshold inevitable when performing a coordinate based meta-analysis. Altogether, the results of the current systematic review have to be interpreted with the limited amount of data and the risk of bias in mind. Future perspectives are that the preliminary results of the current study encourage to generate more data on this topic, thus allowing for ALE meta-analyses with more significant value. This might enable us to better specify the typical activation patterns (ALE results) in response to certain LUT tasks and to understand if and how pattern may differ between healthy controls and patients with LUT dysfunction. \n\nAnother limitation is that this review does not focus on deactivations. As most included studies only report activations, it was decided to focus on activation and not on deactivation. Comparing the overlap of the PFMC and micturition task can therefore be partly biased (see  ). For example, a cluster that activated during PFMC but deactivated during micturition should be counted as an overlapping cluster, but is not found in the current analysis. Despite both tasks are motor tasks of the LUT, they may be used in opposite direction since the pelvic floor should not be contracted during micturition. \n\nThe risk of bias analysis was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias guidelines [ ]. As this tool is not specifically designed for neuroimaging studies, the risk of bias might be underestimated [ ]. It revealed an unclear risk of bias, which is at least partly related to the great variability of study designs, scan protocols, analysis pathways, and the lack of standardization of reporting methods and outcome measures. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis systematic review and ALE analysis define all fMRI and PET evidence for the motoric innervation of the LUT. The key brain areas involved in PFMC are M1, SMA, cingulate gyrus, putamen, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, insula and the cerebellum. The key brain areas involved in micturition are the PAG, PMC, cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Considering the presented activations, both, PFMC and micturition appear distinct which is in line with their different contextual execution. However, deactivations which are underreported and less well understood could not be systematically considered and may show more overlap than currently presented. Despite that the evidence for neuroimaging of the LUT is still scarce and the affective involvement in performing these tasks makes it challenging to study LUT motor tasks, the involved brain areas in healthy controls seem to be defined, so the step towards defining pathology in a patient population with functional bladder disorders can be made. However, this requires standardization of protocols and task execution. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7857581,"text_md5":"cf025a4edced127c6359c99d76fe7282","field_positions":{"authors":[0,124],"journal":[125,133],"publication_year":[135,139],"title":[150,318],"keywords":[332,332],"abstract":[345,2127],"body":[2136,36430]},"batch":3,"pmid":33534812,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0246042","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7857581","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7857581"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7857581\">7857581<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7857581  A systematic review and activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the central innervation of the lower urinary tract: Pelvic floor motor control and micturition"}

However, less is known about brain regions associated with non-conscious processing of faces, and whether a right-hemispheric dominance persists in line with specific affective responses. We aim to review the neural responses systematically, quantitatively, and qualitatively underlying subliminal face processing. PubMed was searched for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) publications assessing subliminal emotional face stimuli up to March 2022. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses and narrative reviews were conducted on all studies that met ALE requirements. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. In a meta-analysis of all 22 eligible studies (merging clinical and non-clinical populations, whole brain and region of interest analyses), bilateral amygdala activation was reported in the left (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1) in 59% of studies, and in the right (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4) in 68% of studies. In a second meta-analysis of non-clinical participants only (  n   = 18), bilateral amygdala was again reported in the left (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4) and right (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4) in 56% of studies for both clusters. In a final meta-analysis of whole-brain studies only (n=14), bilateral amygdala was also reported in the left (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2) in 64% of studies, and right (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8) in 71% of studies. The findings suggest that non-consciously detected emotional faces may influence amygdala activation, especially right-lateralized (a higher percentage of convergence in studies), which are integral for pre-conscious affect and long-term memory processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDetection of faces and the rapid initiation of appropriate emotional reactions constitutes part of the foundation for smooth social interactions and ultimately our survival. Visual search paradigms, such as \u201cface-in-the-crowd,\u201d highlight how the presence of a face, the direction of attention and whether it poses a potential threat, can be detected within the blink of an eye (Pinkham et al.,  ). This automatic processing is largely attributed to the emotional salience portrayed by a face, whereby expressions of anger, fear and disgust significantly raise our vigilance and give an evolutionary advantage for avoiding harm (Murphy and Zajonc,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). By contrast, difficulties with face perception may severely impact social cognitions, e.g., emotion recognition and interpretation of social cues, as seen in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Kleinhans et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ). \n\nEmotion processing is suggested to be dichotomized, with one subcortical and subconscious pathway for emotionally salient stimuli, while the other pathway extends into cortex with integration in the amygdala for more detailed perceptual information (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). In support of the presence of these two separate pathways, delineating the neural pathways of subconscious face processing is often done with subliminal approaches using temporal backward masking and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) (Phillips et al.,  ; Kouider et al.,  ). By manipulating the time interval\u2014the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA)\u2014between the target and the mask, the target stimulus can be interrupted as higher order mechanisms compete with the non-target in object recognition (Enns and Di Lollo,  ). Despite not being consciously perceived, subliminal stimuli can elicit behavioral and physiological responses, e.g., emotional memories, increased skin conductance, and accompanying neural activity (Sebastiani et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ). For example, subliminal emotional faces, masked by neutral faces, activate similar brain areas as those presented supraliminally (Prochnow et al.,  ). These regions may include the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontal cortex (Prochnow et al.,  ; Freeman et al.,  ). \n\nLesion and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a hemispheric lateralization for face processing may exist, with the right hemisphere processing faces holistically and non-consciously, while the left appears to be involved in feature-based processing (Morris et al.,  ; Wada and Yamamoto,  ; Fr\u00e4ssle et al.,  ). Holistic processing is particularly important for face recognition, where key facial features are integrated as a whole rather than being perceived separately (Wang et al.,  ). Emotion processing is also suggested to be lateralized, according to two prevailing hypotheses (L\u00e0davas and Bertini,  ; Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). The right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis postulates that emotions are processed in the right hemisphere independent of their valence. The valence lateralization hypothesis claims that the left is responsible for processing positively valenced stimuli, while the right hemisphere processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, it has been debated whether right-hemispheric dominance occurs, and if this occurs independently of conscious awareness and the emotional valence of faces (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Gainotti,  ; Meng et al.,  ). \n\nTo answer these questions, and to address the variability of fMRI methodologies\u2014such as differences in participant samples, stimulus presentations, applied contrasts, coordinate systems (e.g., Talairach, MNI, and AFNI), scanner strength and statistical analyses\u2014Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses are effective. By analyzing coordinates from individual fMRI studies investigating similar questions, the convergence of foci can be detected with limited confounding effects of varying methodologies, e.g., by weighting foci according to sample size for each study and by using both the statistical significance of individual voxels and a minimum threshold for cluster size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). By doing this, probability maps of neuronal activation can be calculated that lowers the bias introduced by different studies (Kirby and Robinson,  ). In addition, diagnostic   post-hoc   tests and sub-analyses further improve the risk of bias (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nSeparate ALE approaches have previously been applied to study emotional facial processing and differences between subliminal and supraliminal stimuli (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). In Brooks et al. ( ), significant ALE clusters for subliminally presented emotional faces were found in the right amygdala and the right cerebellum. A right hemisphere specialization for unconscious fear-related stimuli was also discussed in a narrative review by L\u00e0davas and Bertini ( ). However, there have been no ALE meta-analyses since 2012 focusing solely on subliminal emotional face processing and so now additional relevant fMRI studies have been published. As such, we aim to expand on Brooks et al.'s ( ) work by implementing the ALE method to quantitatively (in both whole brain and region of interest analyses) review neural responses underlying subliminal emotional face processing. To further nuance the quantitative ALE review, the goal of the qualitative review is to report emotion-specific neural responses to subliminal faces expressing the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger (Ekman,  ). These six emotions are deemed universal and are suggested to be linked with distinct expressions and physiological changes (Ekman,  ). Identifying patterns of lateralization may shed light on underlying neural responses to emotional processing of faces, and hint at how facial processing might be altered in developmental and psychiatric disorders that have core deficits in emotion processing (such as autism, schizophrenia, eating disorders). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe followed the 10   Simple Rules for Neuroimaging Meta-analysis   (M\u00fcller et al.,  ): (1) Specificity of research question (what are the neural correlates of non-consciously processed emotional faces?). (2) Power of meta-analysis (meta-analyses presented here included   n   = 22,   n   = 18 and an exploratory analysis of more robust whole brain studies   n   = 14, with the suggested limit being   n   = 17\u201320). (3) Collect and organize data (the data extracted from studies are presented systematically in  ). (4) Experiments use the same search coverage (separate ALEs were conducted for all studies and whole brain only). (5) Adjust for multiple contrasts within experiments (no included studies contained multiple studies). (6) Double check data and report (Our data collection, inclusion\/exclusion criteria, reported foci and analyses were conducted by AD, AS, and SB and compared). (7) Plan and register analyses (AD, AS, and SB discussed the contrasts to be done and separate analyses. Unfortunately, the protocol was not registered beforehand\u2014it was deemed an update of a previously published study: Brooks et al.,  ). (8) Balance sensitivity and susceptibility for false positives (a more conservative FWE correction was applied to all ALEs). (9) Show diagnostics (the number of studies contributing to the clusters, and the size\/ALE value of the cluster were reported. A risk of bias assessment using the AXIS tool was reported). (10) Transparent reporting (detailed search terms, included studies and GingerALE parameters fully described). \n  \nfMRI studies included in ALE meta-analyses and narrative review (  n   = 22). \n    \n### Literature Search \n  \nThis review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al.,  ;  ). The review was not registered. The PRISMA checklist of recommended items to be reported can be found in  . A computerized search using the database PubMed was conducted, covering the periods from 1975 to March 2022 (last search 2022-03-24). Searches were conducted on titles and abstracts containing the following terms (  = truncated): (fMRI OR brain imaging OR functional magnetic resonance imaging) AND (sublim  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (sublim  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND facial  AND emotion ). Additional filters were utilized to refine the search further; these included: Adults (18+), human participants, English language, no reviews, no case studies, and no meta-analyses. \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of the relevant steps for the literature search conducted in PubMed (Page et al.,  ). Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and narrative review. During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. From the   n   = 74 reports assessed for eligibility,   n   = 52 studies were excluded according to exclusion criteria, leaving   n   = 22 studies. \n  \n\n### Inclusion\/Exclusion Criteria \n  \nTo prevent selection bias, the PRISMA recommendations for systematic literature analysis have been followed and two authors (AD and AS) selected studies based on the broad search terms. Studies were included if they: (a) used task-based fMRI, (b) were conducted using subliminal\/non-conscious presentation of faces using backward masking, (c) included human faces of any gender, race, age, and demonstrating any emotion vs. a neutral face or neutral image, (d) reported the neural activation or deactivation co-ordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space, (e) assessed brain regional activation and deactivation using contrast analyses and not regression models, (f) were published in English, and (g) were published in a peer-reviewed journal article. Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review ( ). During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. \n\n\n### Selected Studies \n  \nOf the 74 publications assessed for eligibility, 52 did not meet the inclusion criteria ( ,  ). Studies were excluded if they did not provide within-subjects contrasts comparing subliminal emotional face stimuli with subliminal neutral stimuli, if the participants were conditioned to the stimuli, if the participants were children, if the participants were made aware of the subliminal presentations before testing and if MNI or Talairach coordinates were not reported. Thus, 22 publications remained and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review. Risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the AXIS appraisal tool ( ). Of these 22 studies, eight were region of interest (ROI) studies, four were whole brain studies, and 10 reported both ROI and whole brain results. The total number of participants was   n   = 796 (50:50 women:men). In the first meta-analysis, all 22 studies (both ROI and whole brain) were included regardless of participant population; the second meta-analysis used only 18 studies (again both ROI and whole brain) that did not include clinical populations; the third meta-analysis excluded the 8 ROI studies (to prevent biasing of ALE results), and examined the 14 whole brain studies as an exploratory analysis. Across the reviewed studies, the subliminal emotional face stimuli expressed fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust. Control conditions included neutral faces, fixation cross, blank screen, no-face stimulus (a gray rectangle), visual noise masks of scrambled faces and non-emotional images (e.g., tomato). See   for details of included studies in both the quantitative and qualitative analysis. The analyzed contrasts from each study are reported in  . \n\n\n### fMRI Methods \n  \nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that indirectly measures neuronal activation   via   Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD). fMRI studies utilize either a whole brain or a ROI technique to measure BOLD. Using whole brain, significant activation clusters are localized by examining voxels across the global space. Conversely, ROI analyses use a mask to include or remove a brain area\/areas from statistical analysis. ROI analyses are less favorable to include in ALE analyses as they tend to inflate the significance of the meta-analysis. ROI analyses differ from small volume correction (SVC) in terms of to what this test is applied and the subsequent output. For example, ROIs return a single   t  \/  F  -value for the whole ROI, given that the test is applied to an average signal of all voxels. Conversely, in the SVC procedure, the test is applied to all voxels (voxel-wise) and therefore the output is a volumetric statistical map with   t  \/  F  -values for each voxel within the small volume. ROI analyses were reported by eight studies included in the current meta-analyses, and so additional analyses were conducted to examine whether these ROI studies biased the overall findings. \n\n\n### Quantitative Data Analyses\u2014ALE \n  \nBrainMap GingerALE version 3.0.2 software (Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) was used to complete the ALE analyses described above, with the updated version of the ALE approach (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Foci were extracted from publications examining neural responses to subliminal face perception, checked by two researchers (AS, SJB). Papers that reported coordinates in standard Talairach space were converted into MNI using the GingerALE software. Text files were subsequently created, listing the study names, number of subjects and a list of the foci (MNI coordinates) associated with neural activation to subliminal stimuli. Specifically, three separate ALE analyses were conducted: (a) utilizing all 22 publications incorporating both whole brain and ROI, and including all types of participant (e.g., clinical and healthy controls); (b) 18 publications that only examined subliminal face processing in healthy controls; (c) an exploratory examination including 14 publications of only healthy controls in whole brain studies (excluding ROI studies). Text files of foci were cross-checked by two researchers as above and are provided as   (Data Sheet). \n\nALE is a statistical modeling technique examining variance between and within fMRI studies using the total foci coordinates reported in each study to build a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel, enabling a modeled activation (MA) threshold map for each study (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Differences in foci positions can be a consequence of between-study variance, e.g., in templates used or heterogeneity of participants, and as such these two main issues are considered in the parameters of the kernel. This is done by weighting the foci reported by the number of participants in each study. Finally, MA maps for each study are combined for each separate meta-analysis, creating an experimental ALE map. This is tested against the null hypothesis that there is random variation in relation to the spatial orientation of neural activation for the specific meta-analysis (e.g., subliminal presentation of faces), but that the within-study variation is fixed. A random effects model is employed by the ALE analysis technique, which assumes a higher than chance likelihood of consensus between different experiments, but not in relation to activation variance within each study. The null distribution map is permuted by the number of studies that constitute each meta-analysis. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used a threshold of   p   < 0.05 False Discovery Rate (FDR), and chose a minimum cluster size of 100 mm , in accordance with our recent ALE publications on this subject (Brooks et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ), and we also used a more conservative (as opposed to dilated) kernel threshold under ALE preferences (Eickhoff et al.,  ). We used an anatomical image overlay program called Mango ( ) to illustrate the results of our meta-analyses. GingerALE employs the term \u201ccontributing studies,\u201d to describe studies that are located within the boundaries of ALE cluster. However, this does not discount other studies that might be located near these boundaries but outside of the cluster, which could have also contributed to it. \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Quantitative\/ALE-Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe significant clusters including those that were significant at the cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a more conservative (smaller) mask threshold, are reported in   for each meta-analysis, and in  . \n  \nClusters of statistically significant activation. \n    \nSignificant ALE cluster maxima of neural activation to subliminal emotional face stimuli surviving FDR correction,   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons, cluster size >100 mm . Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are given. Meta-analysis 1 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221219.1, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1), right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 2 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 3 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n  \n### Meta-Analysis One: Significant ALE Clusters From All Studies \n  \nFrom 193 foci, 835 subjects, and 22 separate studies (24 experiments), the ALE analysis revealed two significant clusters that survived FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Two: Significant ALE Clusters From Non-clinical Samples \n  \nFrom 168 foci, 647 subjects and 18 separate studies (18 experiments), two clusters survived the FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Three: Significant ALE Clusters From Whole Brain Studies Only \n  \nWe also ran a separate exploratory analysis of the whole brain studies alone, excluding any studies which only conducted ROI analyses. From 144 foci, 541 subjects, and 14 studies, the ALE analysis revealed two clusters which survived FWE correction and the predefined cluster criterion. Cluster one was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2). Cluster two was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8). \n\nOf note, the highest percentage of contributing studies was 71% for activation in the right amygdala in whole brain studies only (  n   = 10), and while this was a small number of studies, this finding was corroborated by 68% of all studies reporting right amygdala activation to subliminal emotional faces (  n   = 15). \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Qualitative\/Narrative Review \n  \nA summary of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli for each of the 22 included studies is presented in  . \n  \nSummary diagrams of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli in the reviewed fMRI studies. Subliminally presented faces expressed   (A)   mixed emotional expressions,   (B)   sadness,   (C)   anger,   (D)   fear,   (E)   surprise,   (F)   happiness, and   (G)   disgust. The number within each bar indicates the   n   of the studies. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; NAcc, nucleus accumbens. \n  \n### Emotional Faces: Anger, Happiness, and Sadness Combined \n  \nProchnow et al. ( ) presented facial expressions of anger, happiness, and sadness supraliminally (400 ms) or subliminally (40 ms). Both supraliminal and subliminal conditions of emotional faces elicited activation in the occipital cortex (OCC), fusiform gyrus, and caudal intra-parietal sulcus (cIPS), in comparison to baseline conditions with neutral face masks. Supraliminal emotional faces also activated the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), the right posterior cingulate cortex, the right superior colliculi, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) bordering the anterior insula, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the subliminal emotional faces there was an increase in activation along the posterior right STS, the left premotor cortex area 6, and in the right DLPFC ( ). Control objects (supraliminal non-emotional images, e.g., chair, followed by unemotional adjective pairs) were associated with bilateral activation in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, dorsal paracingulate cortex\/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), DLFC, and left premotor area 6. \n\n\n### Fearful Faces \n  \nTen studies with healthy adult samples investigated the subliminal processing of fearful faces in comparison to neutral faces. Liddell et al. ( ) found that masked (16.7 ms) presentations of fearful facial expressions evoked significantly increased activity in the left superior colliculus, left pulvinar, bilateral amygdalae, and bilateral anterior cingulate. The right amygdala showed a larger cluster of activation than the left. Whole brain analysis confirmed the significant activity observed in the left ventral anterior cingulate seen in the ROI analysis. Whole brain analysis also demonstrated significant responses to subliminal fear in fronto-temporal and somatosensory-related cortices. \n\nIn Pichon et al. ( ), subliminal face presentation was conducted using both forward masking and backward masking (66 ms after the prime) with visual noise masks (scrambled face stimuli). The subliminal faces elicited activations in the bilateral occipital face area (OFA), right fusiform face area (FFA), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG BA45 and BA47), but no activation in the amygdala. Fearful face primes resulted in left parahippocampal gyrus activation, which was enhanced when the target faces appeared at the expected rather than the unexpected time. However, significant changes in activation in the amygdala and FFA were not found. Unlike the influence of temporal attention, the gender congruence of the prime and target face did not influence the parahippocampal gyrus activation. \n\nWhen comparing subliminal and supraliminal presentations of fearful facial expressions, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant activity in the left amygdala, the left dorsal ACC and in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) extending to the right hemisphere in supraliminal fear conditions relative to neutral conditions. Subliminal fear conditions, relative to neutral, elicited significant activity in the bilateral amygdala and ventral right MPFC, extending into the ventral ACC. Whole brain analysis between-conditions confirmed that supraliminal fear had significantly greater responses relative to subliminal fear in DLPFC and visual regions. In contrast, subliminal fear elicited comparatively greater responses in the right hypothalamus and the right ventral ACC. \n\nYang et al. ( ) used encoding and retrieval phases to investigate the affective priming effect for fearful faces. Backward masked fearful or neutral faces were presented during the encoding and during the retrieval participants judged the fearful or neutral expression of the target face. Participants who were unaware the subliminal priming had stronger activation in the left amygdala, while participants who were aware of the priming had stronger activity in the left prefrontal cortex, left occipital region and the left fusiform gyrus. Moreover, unaware participants primed with fearful faces (vs. neutral) produced greater activity in the right amygdala and the right pulvinar. In aware participants, fearful faces generated stronger activity in the left amygdala, right fusiform gyrus and the left STS. They also found a congruency effect whereby congruent faces (fearful\u2013fearful) elicited weaker amygdala activation than incongruent faces (neutral\u2013fearful). \n\nThe supraliminal (179 ms) and subliminal fearful faces (30 ms) were presented to male participants in Phillips et al. ( ). Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the left precuneus, the bilateral superior and the right middle temporal gyri for subliminal fear, and bilateral superior and the right middle temporal and lingual gyri and precuneus for supraliminal fear. Both supraliminal and subliminal fear activated the left inferior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral inferior parietal lobules, and the right cerebellum. Voxels of significant activation in the right amygdala were detected in the supraliminal fear condition, but not in the subliminal condition. Subliminal fear elicited activation in the left caudate nucleus. Moreover, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral cerebellum showed significantly greater mean power of response to subliminal fear than supraliminal presentations of fear. \n\nMasked fear (33 ms) in Etkin et al. ( ) elicited significant activation in the right basolateral amygdala, which was also found to be correlated with anxious traits in the healthy adult sample. Non-masked fear (200 ms) did not lead to basolateral amygdala activation, but instead right dorsal amygdala activation, which was not correlated to anxiousness. Chen et al. ( ) observed right amygdala activation in response to masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces, while non-masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces activated the left amygdala. \n\nEleven out of 12 male participants in Mathiak et al. ( ) showed amygdala responses to fearful faces, whereby seven subjects had bilateral activation, three had left-lateralized activation and one right-lateralized activation. However, volume-corrected thresholds for masked fearful stimuli did not generate significant amygdala activity. Nor did masked fearful faces in Cui et al. ( ) generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex) or in the ROIs of Suslow et al. ( ) (amygdala, thalamus, caudate nuclei, and putamen). \n\n\n### Happy Faces \n  \nOf the reviewed fMRI studies with healthy adult participants, eight included masked happy faces in their subliminal paradigms. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found significant activations in the bilateral amygdala for subliminally presented happy faces (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms). Likewise, adult women in Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) showed significant activation within the left and right amygdala following happy faces masked by neutral faces. In addition, they detected clusters of elevated activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri. The observed right amygdala activation and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri activation during the masked happiness condition were found to be significantly greater than in the masked sadness condition. Suslow et al. ( ) reported clusters of significant activation in response to masked happy faces in the right inferior parietal lobule to right middle temporal regions and in the right thalamus. These clusters were also positively correlated to implicit extraversion measures. \n\nHappy faces presented subliminally in Duan et al. ( ), elicited increased neural activity in the left amygdala, anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal\/orbito-frontal gyrus, and right inferior temporal gyrus, in comparison to neutral faces. When contrasting masked happy faces with masked surprised faces, the happy faces were associated with increased activation of the left posterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Masked presentation of happy faces may also activate the bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc), as demonstrated in Suslow et al. ( ). The right NAcc activation was also found to have a significant positive correlation with the affective priming score of the neutral target face, however no significant priming based on happy faces was established. \n\nIn Victor et al. ( ), females showed reduced BOLD responses to masked happy vs. masked neutral faces in the left amygdala, the right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and the right pregenual ACC (pgACC), relative to men. When amygdala activity was recorded in response to masked faces with happy, sad and angry expressions using fMRI in Dannlowski et al. ( ), no significant effect of gender was observed for any of the investigated emotions. Regarding happy faces vs. neutral faces, no significant bilateral amygdala activity was found during subliminal presentation. However, in comparison to the no-face baseline, subliminal happy faces elicited activations in the right amygdala. Masked happy faces in Cui et al. ( ) did not generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex). \n\n\n### Sad Faces \n  \nFive of the studies examined the brain activation patterns elicited by subliminal faces with sad expressions in healthy adults. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found that sad faces presented subliminally (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms) significantly activated the bilateral amygdala. Suslow et al. ( ) also found significant bilateral amygdala activation following the masked presentation of sad faces. This amygdala activation had significant positive correlations with the affective priming scores given to the neutral target faces. In addition, whole brain analysis revealed a positive correlation between medial frontal gyrus activation and the affective priming score based on sad faces, which was significantly higher than the positive correlation between amygdala activation and affective priming scores. \n\nThe subliminal presentation of sad faces in Dannlowski et al. ( ) yielded significant bilateral amygdala activity, in comparison to both neural faces and the no-face baseline. In addition, greater amygdala responses to masked sad sadness were associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. However, in the female sample of Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ), masked sad faces only generated significantly greater activation within the right amygdala, whereas the left amygdala did not show significant activation. When compared to the masked happiness condition, the masked sadness did not have any suprathreshold voxels within the ROIs. Female participants in Victor et al. ( ), showed elevated BOLD responses to viewing masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus and the bilateral sgACC, compared to male participants. \n\n\n### Angry Faces \n  \nThe processing of subliminal angry facial expressions was investigated in four of the reviewed studies ( ). Significantly increased bilateral amygdala activity was seen for masked angry faces, in comparison to neutral faces, in Dannlowski et al. ( ). However, the elevated amygdala activity following presentation of angry faces was not significantly higher than the no face baseline condition. Similar to the sad faces, the stronger amygdala activation in response to masked angry faces was associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. Cui et al. ( ) found a cluster of activation in the rostral ACC in response to masked angry faces. Rostral ACC activation was also correlated with higher scores on measures of anger and anxiety. In Nomura et al. ( ), the anger prime, neutral prime and control conditions all produced activation in the right fusiform gyrus. Right amygdala activation was only detected in the anger prime condition. Moreover, the responses in the right amygdala had a significant negative correlation with activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus within the angry face prime condition. A significant positive correlation was found between the rate of judgment of anger of the target face and activation intensity in the right amygdala. In Chen et al. ( ) neither subliminal nor supraliminal angry faces elicited amygdala activation in comparison to neutral faces. \n\n\n### Surprised Faces \n  \nOne of the reviewed fMRI studies focused on the neural responses to surprised faces presented below conscious awareness. In comparison to masked neutral faces, masked surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right amygdala, and right thalamus (Duan et al.,  ). Above threshold activation was also detected in clusters within the occipital lobe and temporal lobe. When comparing masked surprised faces with masked happy faces, surprise showed increased activation in the bilateral amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. Clusters of suprathreshold activation were also present in the cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal, and occipital lobes. \n\n\n### Disgusted Faces \n  \nDisgusted faces were investigated by Phillips et al. ( ) using subliminal (30 ms) and supraliminal (170 ms) presentations in a male sample. Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the right fusiform gyrus, precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus in response to subliminal, and the right precuneus, left middle occipital, bilateral lingual, right superior, and left middle temporal gyri in response to supraliminal faces of disgust. Significantly activated voxels were also detected in the bilateral posterior cingulate and right anterior cingulate gyri and the left cerebellum. In addition, supraliminal disgust activated bilateral insulae, while subliminal disgust did not. Subliminal presentations of disgust activated the right thalamus and putamen. Suslow et al. ( ) also used backwardly masked disgusted faces (17 ms) in healthy adult men and women. The subliminal faces of disgust generated clusters in the bilateral anterior cerebellum and the cerebellal lingual. \n\n\n### Studies With Clinical Samples \n  \nThe participants in Dannlowski et al. ( ) suffered from acute major depression. They described clusters of significant activation in both the left and right amygdala for subliminal sad faces vs. neutral faces, and for subliminal angry faces vs. neutral faces. In contrast, the subliminally presented happy faces did not elicit significant changes in brain activation in comparison to neutral faces. No activation by masked happy faces could be detected in comparison with the neutral face baseline. However, when compared to a no-face baseline, masked happy faces were associated with activations in the right amygdala. In participants with an acute major depressive episode, amygdala responses to masked sad faces were greater than responses to masked happy faces (Suslow et al.,  ). The bilateral amygdala responses to subliminal faces expressing sadness were also significantly greater than the bilateral amygdala responses seen in healthy control subjects shown subliminal sad faces. In contrast, the healthy control group had greater bilateral amygdala responses to happy compared with sad faces and compared with the depressed group's bilateral amygdala responses to happy faces. \n\nRedlich et al. ( ) used fMRI to investigate the automatic processing of subliminally presented emotional faces in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in a control sample of MDD patients treated with pharmacotherapy and in a healthy control sample. Both MDD groups had increased bilateral amygdala activity to sad faces compared to the healthy control group at baseline. There was no significant difference for the happy face condition between the groups at baseline. After ~6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, both MDD groups displayed a reduced bilateral amygdala activity in reaction to subliminal sad faces. The pharmacotherapy MDD group also demonstrated a significant increase in amygdala activity to subliminal happy faces, but the ECT MDD group did not. Moreover, no significant differences in amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces compared to controls was detected after 6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, indicating a normalization of the MDD patient groups. \n\nIn Ottaviani et al. ( ), healthy control participants showed bilateral amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces, while participants with panic disorder did not. Masked fearful faces elicited higher amygdala responses than masked neutral faces. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present ALE meta-analysis explored neural activation in response to subliminal emotional faces during fMRI and found bilateral clusters of activation in the amygdala across all studies, as well as those that only examined healthy participants, and those only using whole brain analyses. Meta-analysis one, combining ROI studies with both clinical and non-clinical samples demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, with a higher percentage of studies reporting right amygdala activation. Meta-analysis two, which only examined non-clinical samples also reported bilateral amygdala, converging equally on left and right. Finally, meta-analysis three presented only whole-brain studies, and again demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, most often reported by studies on the right side. Moreover, the narrative review highlighted how the degree of positive or negative affect of the subliminally presented faces may elicit different patterns of neural activation. In particular, increased activation was observed across corticolimbic regions, but predominantly visual cortex areas in response to general subliminal emotional faces. Fearful and happy faces tended to activate bilateral limbic regions ( ). Of the studies examining sad and angry faces, a potentially right-specific amygdala\/fusiform area response was detected. Surprise and disgust appeared to activate subcortical regions in the few studies that examined these emotions. \n\n### Right-Lateralized Amygdala Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nAccording to the affective circumplex model, emotions contain two independent dimensions: valence (the negative or positive nature of the emotion) and arousal (the heightened physiological activity caused by the emotion), which activate distinct neural pathways (Posner et al.,  ; Gerber et al.,  ). The subcortically located amygdala has long been considered a key region for processing faces and their emotions, as lesions within the amygdala can severely impair emotion recognition (Adolphs et al.,  ). The amygdala has also been suggested to encode the different dimensions of emotion in a lateralized manner (Wang et al.,  ). The right amygdala may preferentially subserve the uncertainty of a stimulus' valence, while the left may decode the emotional arousal of a stimulus (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Colibazzi et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). When contrasting subliminal and supraliminal emotion processing, the right amygdala has been implicated in automatic responses to emotion, while the left amygdala is activated during conscious reflection following emotional stimuli (Dyck et al.,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). A potential explanatory model could therefore involve a right amygdala-driven automatic and global emotional response, followed by a left amygdala-driven differentiated emotional reaction which incorporates information on arousal to further guide cognition and behavior (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). \n\nThe present findings of significant ALE clusters within the right amygdala, based on the reviewed non-clinical ROI studies and the whole brain studies, slightly differ from the bilateral activation following subliminal emotional faces found in Brooks et al. ( ). However, while Brooks et al. ( ) argued for more robust right amygdala activation, prior imaging studies have also reported elevated left amygdala activation in response to emotionally arousing stimuli such as facial expressions (Morris et al.,  ; Lane et al.,  ; Vytal and Hamann,  ). More specifically, left amygdala activation has been associated with fearful facial expressions (Hardee et al.,  ). However, of the 10 reviewed studies using fearful face masks, the reports of significant amygdala activation were mixed. Liddell et al. ( ) and Yang et al. ( ) reported bilateral amygdala activity with greater right lateralization. Etkin et al. ( ) and Chen et al. ( ) also reported right amygdala activation. Conversely, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant left amygdala activation, while Phillips et al. ( ), Mathiak et al. ( ) Suslow et al. ( ), Cui et al. ( ), and Pichon et al. ( ), did not detect significantly altered amygdala activity in either hemisphere for the subliminal fear conditions. The significant right amygdala clusters detected at group level may therefore be due to the different emotional face expressions, e.g., happiness and sadness, used across the included non-clinical ROI studies. Likewise, the experimental designs of the 14 studies included in the whole brain analysis used subliminal faces with varying emotional valence which could underlie variance in amygdala activation. \n\n\n### Right Parahippocampal Gyrus Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nTwo of the conducted ALE analyses, including whole brain studies analyzed separately, revealed significant right-lateralized activation which could be interpreted as merging onto the parahippocampal gyrus, which is located anteromedially to the amygdala and adjacent to the hippocampus. In addition to the amygdala-centered network, the hippocampus-centered network plays a pivotal role in emotion processing (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). By integrating emotional information from the amygdala,   via   the ACC, the hippocampal complex modulates the consolidation and retrieval of emotional memories (Carlson et al.,  ; Bian et al.,  ). The parahippocampal gyrus takes part in the limbic system and its activation together with the amygdala is in accordance with previous ALE meta-analyses on implicit emotion processing (Li et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ), Interestingly, Shi et al. ( ) found that masking tasks were associated with parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala activation, while inattention tasks of implicit emotional processing preferentially activated the fusiform gyrus. The different activation patterns elicited by masking tasks and inattention tasks, respectively, suggest that the former targets early stages of emotional processing while the latter captures a later stage of pre-attentive emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). The results provide support for the ability of emotional faces to rapidly activate subcortical brain regions, before cortical structures are recruited to evaluate the emotional stimulus and coordinate an appropriate response (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). \n\nParadigms using supraliminal emotional stimuli (e.g., emotionally evocative sentences), have detected strong associations between elevated amygdala and parahippocampal activity and arousal ratings (Colibazzi et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). Indeed, emotional arousal is a well-established mediator in memory consolidation   via   the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network (Dolcos et al.,  ). The current findings of clusters with significant activation within the right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus for subliminal emotional faces, suggests how non-conscious stimuli may influence memory formation and thereby guide behaviors by facilitating the recognition of familiar faces and the emotions they may be expressing. For example, attentional biases toward masked fearful faces may predispose individuals to anxiety or exacerbate sensations of threat, despite being in a safe environment (Carlson et al.,  ). This may in turn lead to a generalization of contextual fear, as seen in posttraumatic stress disorder, which can severely impact everyday life (Bian et al.,  ). \n\nAnger has previously been associated with activations of the right parahippocampal gyrus (Vytal and Hamann,  ). Here, Nomura et al. ( ) and Dannlowski et al. ( ) did not report significant changes in parahippocampal gyrus activity during masked anger conditions. However, surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus (Duan et al.,  ), whereas fearful face primes generated left parahippocampal gyrus activation (Pichon et al.,  ). Victor et al. ( ) detected gender differences with female participants demonstrating elevated BOLD responses to masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus, compared to male participants. Functional interaction studies have proposed distinct amygdala neural signatures associated with supraliminal facial expressions of different emotions (Diano et al.,  ). As the current meta-analysis did not conduct separate ALE analyses for each subliminally presented emotion, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the valence lateralization hypothesis, where the left processes positively valenced stimuli and the right processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, the indications of right-lateralized amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus activity from the reviewed ROI studies and whole brain studies, regardless of emotional valence, suggests that the right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis may apply to subliminal processing as well (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). \n\n\n### Right Striatum Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nSome studies reported in the narrative review demonstrate increased activation to subliminal emotional faces in the striatum. The striatum is comprised of the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and is primarily known for its role in voluntary motor control (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Neuroimaging work has highlighted the striatum's involvement in integrating social information and reward processes (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Moreover, the ventral striatum has been found to be more sensitive to subliminally presented faces in comparison to supraliminally presented faces (Ito et al.,  ). \n\nDuring emotion identification, the striatum has been suggested to act in opposition to the amygdala (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). For example, while the amygdala may preferentially react to threatening angry or fearful faces, the striatum may be tuned to detect non-threatening sad or happy faces (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). While two of the studies in the current review reported increased putamen and nucleus accumbens activation in response to masked happy faces (Duan et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ), three reported putamen and caudate activation in response to masked negative emotions (Phillips et al.,  ; Liddell et al.,  ; Dannlowski et al.,  ). Despite the mixed emotional valences, the right striatum activation seen in the reviewed studies, suggests that subliminal face processing is not only important for threat perception but also for drawing our attention to cues which could lead to social rewards, such as social inclusion (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). \n\n\n### Clinical Samples of Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder \n  \nMood disorders are often characterized by emotional dysfunctions which manifest as abnormal affective processing and behaviors, such as altered reward appraisal and negative attentional biases (Diekhof et al.,  ). When it comes to face processing, depressed patients may have trouble recognizing neutral faces and have been shown to wrongfully ascribe sadness to supraliminal neutral expressions (Lepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ). Prior work has attributed these depression-related tendencies to amygdala hyperactivity, but it is not yet established whether this aberrant processing should be regarded as a causal factor or a clinical manifestation of depression (Stuhrmann et al.,  ). Intriguingly, a hyperactive amygdala state can also be detected during the subliminal presentations of sad faces, as indicated by the reviewed studies with MDD patients (Dannlowski et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ; Redlich et al.,  ). The MDD participants also had greater amygdala responses to masked sad faces in comparison to masked happy faces, while the opposite was seen for the healthy controls (Suslow et al.,  ). \n\nA previous ALE meta-analysis comparing MDD patients and healthy volunteers also found different brain activation patterns depending on the stimulus valence (emotional faces or words; Groenewold et al.,  ). Negative stimuli elicited greater activation in the right amygdala, left striatum, dorsal anterior cingulate and parahippocampal areas in the MDD participants. The same brain regions were activated in response to positive stimuli, but to a lesser extent than the healthy controls (Groenewold et al.,  ). The opposing neural activation patterns, with the amygdala highly tuned to negative information (Murray et al.,  ), and lower activity in the ventral striatum tuned to positive information (Diekhof et al.,  ), support a negative attention bias in depression where negative stimuli may be preferentially processed (Gotlib et al.,  ). Given that subliminal faces expressing sadness may also elicit elevated amygdala responses in MDD patients, as seen in Suslow et al. ( ) and Redlich et al. ( ), it is emphasized how depression-relevant information may be subconsciously processed and is therefore difficult to change. However, Redlich et al. ( ) demonstrated how amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces can be normalized in MDD patients following 6 weeks of ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy. This highlights the possibilities of altering dysfunctional emotional face processing in mood disorders. \n\nIn contrast to the above findings from MDD patients, participants with panic disorder did not show amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces in Ottaviani et al. ( ). Although the masked fearful faces did elicit higher amygdala responses than the masked neutral faces. Patients with panic disorder suffer from recurrent panic attacks, accompanying physical symptoms such as an increased pulse or chest pain, and anticipatory anxiety (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Supraliminal presentations of emotional faces have previously generated increased amygdala activation in participants with anxiety disorders when viewing fearful faces relative to happy faces, compared with healthy controls (Fonzo et al.,  ). Furthermore, anxiety-prone individuals have been shown to have significantly higher bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces (Stein et al.,  ). A hyperactive insula has also been associated with panic disorder diagnoses (Fonzo et al.,  ). The insula is associated with interoceptive processes which signal internal body states (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Elevated insula activity may therefore reflect an increased sensitivity to distressing body sensations in individuals with panic disorder (Fonzo et al.,  ). As Ottaviani et al. ( ) relied on a ROI-based analysis for the amygdala only, no results were reported for the insula. \n\n\n### Strengths and Limitations \n  \nA major strength of the current study is the use of ALE methodology which addresses the difficulties with meta-analyzing fMRI studies, due to the different statistical contrasts used in creating neural activation images. An additional strength is that the right amygdala activation (extending into the right parahippocampal gyrus) remained significant when the analysis was re-run without the ROI studies, which strengthens the findings. However, the ALE approach does not account for the intensity of the BOLD signal reported in each study. It is also possible that differences in the fMRI set-ups and participant instructions could have influenced the results. The results may also have been affected by differences in the sample demographics. For example, Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) only tested women, while Phillips et al. ( ) and Mathiak et al. ( ) only included men. However, there were not enough studies to conduct an ALE to examine gender differences. \n\nThe studies in the current meta-analysis all used masking tasks which have been proven useful for examining the early stages of implicit emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). Of note, binocular rivalry and interocular suppression approaches can also be used in the study of emotional face processing, but this meta-analysis only included studies using masking tasks (Alpers and Gerdes,  ; Yang and Yeh,  ). The studies presented the masks for 40 ms or shorter, which is deemed sufficient to prevent the conscious detection of the prime stimulus (Esteves and \u00d6hman,  ). However, detection of non-conscious primes can occur below 40 ms (Szczepanowski and Pessoa,  ), which is why it is important to pair the masking tasks with a subsequent detection task to ensure that the participants did not perceive the masked stimulus. Both subjective and objective criteria to test the potential awareness of the prime were used across the reviewed studies ( ). Some studies relied solely on subjective reports of visual awareness (e.g., Duan et al.,  ; Mathiak et al.,  ; Prochnow et al.,  ). Other studies used objective discrimination thresholds where unaware perception was defined as by chance performance in forced-choice detection tasks (e.g., Liddell et al.,  ; Ottaviani et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). As information about the non-conscious stimulus may only be accessible for a limited time, it may fade before visual awareness can be self-reported and lead to incorrect assumptions being made for the subliminal experimental conditions. Therefore, objective criteria may be more suitable as a determinant (Pessoa et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). However, running sub-analyses for studies using objective or subjective criteria was unfortunately not possible due to the limited number of whole brain studies in this ALE. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first ALE meta-analysis focusing on fMRI studies of subliminal emotional face processing. Clusters of significant activation were detected in bilateral amygdala, with most study convergence in the right amygdala, in response to non-consciously presented multi-valenced images of faces. Given the integral role of the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network in memory formation, it is compelling to consider how these brain regions may be activated without conscious awareness. An impaired ability to interpret emotional facial cues may be particularly worrisome for individuals suffering from mental health conditions. Future fMRI studies of non-consciously presented, multi-valenced affective stimuli will be important in delineating the implicated neural pathways in both functional and dysfunctional states. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAD: manuscript preparation, investigation, formal analysis, and data curation.

{"text":"Zapparoli, Laura and Seghezzi, Silvia and Paulesu, Eraldo\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nThe What, the When, and the Whether of Intentional Action in the Brain: A Meta-Analytical Review\n\n# Keywords\n\nintentional action\nmotor control\nfMRI\nPET\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIn their attempt to define discrete subcomponents of intentionality, Brass and Haggard ( ) proposed their   What, When, and Whether model   (  www  -  model  ) which postulates that the content, the timing and the possibility of generating an action can be partially independent both at the cognitive level and at the level of their neural implementation. The original proposal was based on a limited number of studies, which were reviewed with a discursive approach. To assess whether the model stands in front of the more recently published data, we performed a systematic review of the literature with a meta-analytic method based on a hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm. We identified 15 PET\/fMRI studies well-suited for this quest. HC revealed the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the medial prefrontal cortex, with the more anterior regions (the anterior cingulum) involved in more abstract decisions of whether to execute an action and the more posterior ones (the middle cingulum or the SMA) recruited in specifying the content and the timing components of actions. However, in contrast with the original   www  -model, this dissociation involves also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe, in a component specific manner: the supramarginal gyrus for the   what   component, the pallidum and the thalamus for the   when   component, the putamen and the insula for the   whether   component. We then calculated co-activation maps on the three component-specific   www   clusters of the medial wall of the frontal\/limbic lobe: to this end, we used the activation likelihood approach that we applied on the imaging studies on action contained in the BrainMap.org database. This analysis confirmed the main findings of the HC analyses. However, the BrainMap.org data analyses also showed that the aforementioned segregations are generated by paradigms in which subjects act in response to conditional stimuli rather than while driven by their own intentions. We conclude that the available data confirm that the neural underpinnings of intentionality can be fractionated in discrete components that are partially independent. We also suggest that intentionality manifests itself in discrete components through the boosting of general purpose action-related regions specialized for different aspects of action selection and inhibition. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMotor control has been the object of interest of many disciplines, including psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and, since the earliest days, philosophy, particularly when the object of enquiry are the conscious aspects of motor control and intentionality (Jeannerod,  ; Frith et al.,  ; Haggard,  ). \n\nA comprehensive model that differentiates the various stages of movement production is not available: even articulated models of motor control (see for example Frith et al.,  ) remain underspecified, especially when considering the intentional components and their neural implementation. \n\nIn an earlier attempt to provide a model of the brain bases of intentionality, Jahanshahi ( ) argued that, in principle, it should be possible to characterize intentional actions in at least three main components: the content (  what   component), the timing (  when   component) and the possibility of being executed or inhibited (  whether   component). However, in reviewing the then available neuroimaging literature, they concluded that there was no sufficient evidence that such components are represented in discrete brain circuits. In their unitary brain model of intentionality, they proposed a \u201csystem\u201d for intentional actions located in the pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA), with subcortical inputs coming from the striatum and through the thalamus: in their views, these systems are responsible for the all three features of intentional action (Jahanshahi,  ). \n\nTen years later, Brass and Haggard ( ) re-assessed the early insights of Jahanshahi ( ) and, taking advantage of a larger set of imaging data, proposed that a \u201cWhat, When, and Whether\u201d model (  www-model  )  of intentional action is justified also on anatomical grounds. The original   www-model   was based on a set of experiments that we review here briefly together with more recent observations. \n\n### \u201c  What  \u201d component \n  \nThe   What   component has been mostly investigated by using fMRI procedures similar to the \u201cFree selection paradigm\u201d (Lau et al.,  ), in which two experimental conditions are compared: a condition in which responses are externally determined by a cue and a condition in which the participants have to choose freely between different motor responses. Typically, the   What   component has been related with the activation of the fronto-medial cortex at the level of the rostral cingulate zone (Deiber et al.,  ; Frith et al.,  ; Hyder et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  , ; Mueller et al.,  ; Krieghoff et al.,  ), the SMA (Lau H. C. et al.,  ; van Eimeren et al.,  ) and pre-SMA (Deiber et al.,  ; Lau et al.,  , ; Brass and Haggard,  ). \n\n\n### \u201c  When  \u201d component \n  \nThe timing component of intentional actions has been investigated by using the paradigm of Libet (Libet et al.,  ). For example, Lau et al. ( ) associated the judgment of the onset of the intention to move with activation of the pre-SMA (Lau et al.,  ). Libet' s paradigm has a number of limitations (see for example Trevena and Miller,  ; Lau H. et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ), first and foremost, of being meta-cognitive in nature and perhaps not terribly well-suited to fMRI given the temporal resolution of the technique and the time scale of the neurophysiological events seen with EEG during the paradigm. \n\nThe   When   component has been explored also by Jahanshahi et al. ( ) and Jenkins et al. ( ) who compared self-initiated extensions of the index finger with fingers' extensions triggered by pacing tones at unpredictable intervals: they found an activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specifically for the self-paced condition (Jahanshahi et al.,  ; Jenkins et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, in an early and solitary attempt to dissociate the anatomical bases of the   What   and the   When   components in the same experiment, Hoffstaedter et al. ( ) manipulated the content and the timing of the motor responses of their participants. They found activations of the SMA, the insula, the globus pallidus, and the anterior putamen in relation to the free selection of the action's timing and the activation of the pre-SMA and the dorsal premotor cortex in relation to the free selection of the actions' content (Hoffstaedter et al.,  ). \n\n\n### \u201c  Whether  \u201d component \n  \nThe absence of a motor response as the result of the choice of action inhibition has partly hindered the study of the intentional inhibition processes with an explicit experimental task. The Libet' s task has been the main paradigm used to investigate voluntary inhibition. Using fMRI, Brass and Haggard have shown that an area of the dorsal and rostral fronto-medial cortex is more active when participants intentionally inhibit a response rather than when they complete the same action (Brass and Haggard,  ). In any event, the voluntary inhibition of actions has been recently studied also with novel tasks like in the case of the   marble task   (K\u00fchn et al.,  ; Schel et al.,  ) or the motivation driven   pain avoidance paradigm   of Lynn et al. ( ). These experiments showed that intentional inhibition rely on a neural network that includes parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally (K\u00fchn et al.,  ; Schel et al.,  ) and the pre-SMA (Schel et al.,  ; Lynn et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Aims of the study \n  \nAfter the initial proposal of the   www-model  , some new ground has been covered with new explicit experiments to justify a formal assessment of the model, this time with explicit meta-analytical techniques. \n\nIs the segregation of different components of the   www-model   justified by the new evidence? If so, does it involve specific portions of the medial wall of the frontal lobe and of the cingulate gyrus? Further, does the mapping of the discrete components involve other brain regions in a specific manner? Again, if so, is it possible, with all the needed caution, to infer from these additional regions on the nature of the subcomponents of intentionality postulated by the original model? \n\nFurther, are the regions involved in intentionality anatomically specific or do they simply contribute to this aspect of behavior while being also involved in conditional aspects of action selection? \n\nThese were all lingering questions on the   www-model   that we tried to address in the present study. To this end, we first used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify component specific clusters. As the reader will see, the specific literature available is barely sufficient to make statistical inferences on the significance of the clusters identified. However, after the initial hierarchical clustering procedure, we interrogated the vast BrainMap.org database and generated co-activation maps based on the main component-specific medial wall clusters of the frontal lobe. This permitted the desired statistical assessment of the anatomical dissociations initially identified by hierarchical clustering. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data collection and preparation \n  \nOur meta-analysis was based on neuroimaging articles investigating the neurofunctional correlates of intentional action using PET or fMRI in adult subjects. \n\nCandidate studies were selected through the PubMed database ( ). The search keys were: \u201cIntentional action & fMRI\u201d and \u201cIntentional action & PET.\u201d These queries returned 27 neuroimaging articles investigating the neurofunctional correlates of intentional actions. We included only studies that did satisfy the following inclusion criteria: (1) sample population composed of normal adult subjects; (2) imaging technique: PET or fMRI; (3) data reported using stereotactic coordinates; (4) comparison between intentional actions and stimulus-driven actions. As a consequence of these inclusion criteria, 12 studies were excluded from the analysis. Among the 15 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, 6 studies investigated the   What   component, 3 studies the   When   component, and 4 studies the   Whether   component. Finally, 2 studies investigated both the   What   and the   When   components. These studies were then classified on the basis of the examined component (see Supplementary Table  ). \n\nFor the suitable studies, in the meta-analysis we used data derived from (i) within group   simple effects   and (ii) interaction effects. The simple effects were: \u201cIntention driven trials\u201d and \u201cStimulus driven trials.\u201d The interaction effects  were \u201cIntention driven trials > Stimulus driven trials\u201d and vice versa. As there were no sufficient local maxima for the contrasts designed to identify the stimulus driven acts, these were not analyzed any further. \n\nTo summarize, the data selection led us to analyse 150 stereotactic activation loci,   71   peaks associated with the   What   component,   42   peaks with the When component and   37   peaks with the Whether component of intentional actions. \n\n\n### Classification of the raw data prior to clustering analyses \n  \nFor each activation peak, we recorded all relevant information about the statistical comparison that generated it, the nature of the experimental task and the investigated component. \n\nWe therefore determined a list of classification criteria to characterize each peak of activation included in the dataset:\n   \n\u2013 t-values or z-scores; \n  \n\u2013 Sample size; \n  \n\u2013 Average age of the subjects; \n  \n\u2013 Stereotactic template (MNI or Tailarach and Tournoux template); \n  \n\u2013 Whole brain or region-of-interest analysis; \n  \n\u2013 Scanning Technique (PET or fMRI); \n  \n\u2013 Statistical thresholds and nature of the correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\nIn order to combine the data coming from studies based on different stereotactic spaces, the stereotactic coordinates of studies in which activation peaks were reported in terms of the Talairach and Tournoux ( ) atlas were transformed into the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) stereotactic space using Matthew Brett's procedure as implemented in the software GingerAle ( ). \n\n\n### Clustering procedure \n  \nWe first performed a component specific hierarchical clustering analyses (HC) of the activation peaks: the analysis allowed us to extract the principal clusters of regional effects from the database (Cattinelli et al.,  ) for each www component. \n\nHierarchical clustering was performed by using functions implemented in MATLAB 2016a. After computation of squared Euclidean distances between each pair of the input data, clusters with minimal dissimilarity were recursively merged using Ward's ( ) criterion which minimizes total intra-cluster variance after each merging step. As described in Cattinelli et al. ( ) and Crepaldi et al. ( ), \u201c  this procedure results in a tree, whose leaves represent singletons (i.e., clusters formed of a single activation peak), and whose root represents one large cluster including all the activation peaks submitted to the algorithm. Each level of the tree reports the clusters created by the algorithm at a specific processing step, as it progresses from individual activation peaks at the lowest level to the all-inclusive final cluster at the top of the tree.\u201d   The procedure was continued until the average standard deviation around the cluster centroids of the individual peaks, in the   x, y  , and   z   directions, remained below 5.0 mm. This measure roughly mimics the spatial resolution of fMRI studies. As hierarchical clustering may be sensitive to the order in which the individual data are processed, and may generate alternative clustering trees when integers are used (Morgan and Ray,  ), an optimal clustering solution was identified by accepting the solution with maximized the between cluster error sum of squares (see for example Cattinelli et al.,  ). The mean coordinates of each cluster included in the final set were then passed as an input to a MATLAB script to automatically label the anatomical correspondence of the stereotactic coordinates of the centroids of each cluster. This procedure implied a query of the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template available in the MRIcron visualization Software (Rorden and Brett,  ). The initial automatic anatomical assignations were then double-checked by the authors with direct visual inspection on the AAL template and, if needed, the corresponding volumetric MRI scan template Ch2Bet released with the MRIcron software. \n\nGiven the number of peaks available for each analysis, relevant clusters at this stage were identified on the basis of the numerosity of the peaks in each cluster. Clusters were further considered if they contained a number of coordinates greater than the median of the distribution for each analysis and, in any event, with no <3 coordinates. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood analyses \n  \nTo assess to what extent the functional segregations identified by the HC analyses could be replicated on a much larger dataset of studies on action, we interrogated the BrainMap.org database to generate co-activation maps for the   What, When  , and   Whether   patterns using the Activation Likelihood Estimate approach (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Co-activation maps are essentially estimates of the probability that local effects, expressed as triplets of stereotactic coordinates, co-occur in a data-set together with the activation of a seed reference region. The advantage of the ALE approach is that the statistical significance of the clusters identified is assessed using formal statistical thresholding. In this case, three separate co-activation maps were calculated using as seeds the three specific clusters identified in the medial wall of the frontal\/limbic lobe, as they were also postulated in the original www-model. The interrogation of the BrainMap.org database was performed by using a 10 mm wide 3D region of interest defined around the centroid of each cluster (the coordinates are indicated in bold font in Table  ). \n  \n Hierarchical clustering analysis  . \n  \nIn BOLD the stereotactic coordinates used as centroids for subsequent the co-activation maps analyses using the Activation Likelihood Estimate technique. \n  \nWe interrogated all the studies that in the database are classified with the key-word \u201c  action  \u201d and \u201c  activation  .\u201d \n\nThe aim of these analyses was three-fold: (1) on the one hand we wanted to test the hypothesis that co-activation maps generated starting from the three main clusters of the medial wall of the frontal lobe and of the cingulate cortex can produce similarly segregated results as in the specific hierarchical clustering, once the three maps were formally compared (2) further, we wanted to test the hypothesis on whether the brain regions outside the frontal lobe would co-vary with the original seeds in a similar manner (3) by analyzing the composition of the BrainMap.org data-base experiments, that contributed to the identification of medial-wall clusters, we wanted to learn to what extent these could be associated, even if loosely, to intentional action and its subcomponents at the center of our quest. \n\nAs an initial step, three separate co-activation maps were calculated for each of the three seed clusters identified by the HC procedure. Subsequently, each co-activation map was compared with the other two lumped together. \n\nFurthermore, once a component specific cluster was identified in the BrainMap.org database, we explored its composition as far as the generative paradigms was concerned. We paid particular attention to the relative contribution of go\/no-go paradigms as these are closer to aspects of motor control entailed by the intentional\/conditional dichotomy, particularly for the whether component. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Hierarchical clustering \n  \nFor the    what    component the data clustered in the right middle cingulum, the right frontal middle gyrus, the right supramarginal gyrus and the left inferior triangular frontal gyrus (see Table   and Figure  ). \n  \n Hierarchical clustering analysis results for (A)   the what component;   (B)   the when component;   (C)   the whether component and a summary of all the components on the medial view of the brain. \n  \nFor the    when    component we found clusters in the right SMA, the right frontal middle gyrus, in the right inferior parietal lobule, in the right rolandic operculum, in the left inferior opercular frontal gyrus and in the lenticular nucleus bilaterally (see Table   and Figure  ). \n\nFinally, for the    whether    component, specific clusters were seen at the level of the right anterior and the left middle cingulum, the left inferior orbital frontal gyrus, the right insula and subcortical structures, such as the thalamus and the putamen (see Table   and Figure  ). \n\n\n### Co-activation maps \n  \nThe BrainMap.org search for co-activations on the   What, When  , and   Whether   clusters of the medial frontal lobe wall (based on the centroids in bold in Table  ) retrieved 1,201 foci from 56 statistical comparisons for the   What   cluster, 1,488 foci from 73 statistical comparisons for the   When   cluster, and 614 foci from 24 statistical comparisons for the   Whether   component. \n\nFigure   illustrates the co-activation maps calculated around the original clusters used as seeds for the interrogation of the BrainMap.org database (statistical threshold   p   < 0.05 FDR corrected). \n  \n Co-activations maps calculated with ALE for (A)   the what component;   (B)   the when component;   (C)   the whether component and a summary of all the components on the medial view of the brain. \n  \nIt should be noted that when seen as simple effects (e.g., the co-activation map generated by the    what    seed alone) most of the regions implicated by the HC analysis were also identified by the co-activation maps analysis (regions indicated with the symbol   in Table  ). Their relative segregation and embedding is illustrated in Figure  . \n\nEach individual map was then compared with a combination of the other two maps: for example, the    What    map vs.    When    &    Whether    ones combined, and so forth. For these comparisons, a more lenient   p   < 0.005 uncorrected threshold (cluster size threshold 300 mm ) was used. \n\nThese analyses led to identification of regions that genuinely dissociate on the basis of their co-activation with the seeds used. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure   and summarized in Tables  , the comparative co-activation maps analysis confirms the functional dissociation along the medial wall of the frontal lobe, in a caudo-rostral direction, into a   what, when, and whether   components. Together with these brain regions, there were co-segregations of component-specific regions, particularly for the lenticular nuclei for the   when   component (see Figures   for a comparison between the two analyses). \n  \n Comparison of the dissociation between components assessed with (A)   hierarchical clustering analysis results and   (B)   ALE co-activation maps. \n    \n Co-activation maps analyses  . \n  \n A, What > (When and Whether) from seed at x = 4; y = 20; z = 38  . \n\n B, When > (What and Whether) from seed at x = 5; y = \u22123; z = 62  . \n\n C, Whether > (What and When) from seed at x = \u22121; y = 29; z = 35  . \n  \nWe also assessed whether the foci that contributed to the segregation of the component specific clusters of the median wall of the frontal lobe were associated with specific tasks. Tables   describes the nature of the tasks behind the regional effects. First, it should be noted that these did not contain foci from the studies that were entered in the present meta-analysis. Second, after an initial qualitative scrutiny, we compared the relative prevalence of go\/no-go paradigms vs. other kind of paradigms. \n  \n Composition analysis of the medial frontal wall clusters isolated by the comparative co-activation maps analyses performed on the BrainMap.org dataset  . \n  \n The table reports the comparison of the proportion of regional effects derived from go\/no-go paradigms and all other paradigms within each of the three clusters from the medial wall of the frontal\/limbic lobe  . \n\n A, Chi-Squared Test\u2014What vs. When  . \n\n B, Chi-Squared Test\u2014Whether vs. When  . \n\n C, Chi-Squared Test\u2014Whether vs. What  . \n  \nWe then performed three Chi-squared pairwise comparisons between component specific cluster compositions to find that the relative prevalence of go\/no-go data was significantly greater for the   whether   and   what   clusters in comparison with the data that generated the   when   cluster (see Table  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nContrary to previous anatomically \u201cunitary\u201d models of willed action (Jahanshahi,  ), Brass and Haggard ( ) proposed the existence of a distributed meso-frontal system, responsible for discrete aspects of intentionality, encoding what to do, when to do it or whether or not to do it. However, in both the cited models, the authors based their conclusions on a qualitative analysis of the available PET\/fMRI literature, characterized by a number of different experimental approaches. \n\nThe current meta-analytic study was conducted in order to further test these alternative neurocognitive models of intentional action, by formally exploring, as quantitatively as possible, the available literature. The results of our combination of hierarchical clustering and ALE meta-analytical procedures expands the initial model of Brass and Haggard ( ) showing that (1) a segregation of intention specific regions is possible even though the regions involved go beyond the mesial wall of the frontal lobe; (2) the regions involved coincide with brain areas that are active also for conditional (non-intentional) motor behaviors. This latter finding suggests that intentionality manifests itself in discrete components through the boosting of general purpose action-related regions specialized for different aspects of action selection and inhibition. \n\n### A multi-component neural model of intentionality \n  \nOur results partially confirm the assumption of Brass and Haggard's model (2008), suggesting the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the medial prefrontal cortex, with the more anterior regions involved in more abstract decisions of whether to execute an action and the more posterior ones recruited in specifying the content and, yet more dorsally, the timing components of actions. \n\nFor example, for the decision about which action to perform (  what   component) the data clustered at the level of the right middle cingulum; the middle cingulum has been previously associated to conflict processing and conflict monitoring (Botvinick et al.,  ; Carter and van Veen,  ) and it could contribute to the specific resolution of an internal conflict about which action to execute among different alternatives. \n\nFor what concerns the decision about the timing of the action, we found a cluster in the right SMA; this region has been previously explicitly linked to the timing or to the intentional initiation of a movement (Cunnington et al.,  ; Debaere et al.,  ). The association between the SMA and timing of intentional action is supported by recent studies on Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by difficulties in implementing intentional behaviors, but this impairment is reduced in the presence of an external salient cue, such as, for example, a fire (Jahanshahi,  ); for this reason, it has been widely hypothesized that PD patients have a malfunctioning of the internal timing of action (Brass and Haggard,  ). In PD patients, the SMA has abnormal connectivity with the thalamus, especially during the OFF-medication phase (Michely et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, the studies investigating the intentional decision about whether or not to act converged in a cluster at the level of the right cingulum in its anterior portion, a region more anterior than the ones involved in the other two components. This finding confirms that the intentional inhibition of an action involves separate neural structures fleshing out the concept that deciding whether to act or not is separable from other aspects of intentionality. \n\n\n### Going beyond the frontal mesial cortex \n  \nIn contrast with the original www-model, the dissociations for the different components involved also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe, in a component specific manner. \n\nFor example, for the   what   component the data clustered at the level of the right supramarginal gyrus, a finding confirmed by the co-activation maps analysis. The involvement of the parietal lobule in the decision about which action to execute should not be a surprise: the inferior parietal lobules are in fact critical nodes for the representation of actions and intentions to act according to previous findings (Tunik et al.,  ). Recently, Gallivan et al. ( ) showed that intentions for specific movements could be predicted by the spatial activity patterns in these areas. Moreover, direct electrical stimulation of the right inferior parietal lobule induces a strong intention to move; at relatively high stimulation intensities (~8 mA) patients may even feel an illusory sense of movement (Desmurget et al.,  ). Thus, in the context of intentional action, the parietal lobule seems to contribute to movement intention and motor awareness with specific reference to specific body parts. \n\nFor what concerns the internal timing of the action, a specific cluster was found in the frontal operculum, a structure previously associated with the synchronization of voluntary hand movements to an auditory rhythm (Thaut,  ). It is also telling the involvement of the motor component of the lenticular nuclei bilaterally: these are of course part of a cortico-subcortical-cortical network that regulates motor behavior (Graybiel,  ) and that is dysfunctional in movement disorders (see review in Crittenden and Graybiel,  ). \n\nFinally, for the   whether   component, our data clustered also at the level of the right anterior insula; anterior insula activations have been reported in various studies on response inhibition (Wager et al.,  ). Moreover, there is evidence indicating that anterior insula is associated with concentration and \u201ccognitive effort\u201d (Allen et al.,  ): if so, its involvement in this class of tasks, may represent the strain to decide whether to do or not to do something after this has already been planned. \n\nWe found two more clusters associated with the whether component, at the level of the thalamus and the putamen; the thalamus, and the basal ganglia in general, are known to play a crucial role in action selection (Humphries and Gurney,  ; Humphries et al.,  ). The specific involvement of such structures in the intentional inhibition of actions is supported by their abnormal functioning in Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, a movement disorder characterized by the presence of unwanted movements that patients are not usually able to inhibit (see review in Zapparoli et al.,  ): this neurological disease is most likely associated with aberrant activity in the basal ganglia and with functional changes in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits (see Mink,  ; Leckman et al.,  ; Felling and Singer,  ; Ganos et al.,  ). A malfunction of the same circuitry has been described also in the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, see for example Bandelow et al.,  ). The spectrum of OCD symptoms is too broad to be readily accommodated by malfunctions of the www-neural circuitry alone. However, as much as complex motor tics can be very similar to motor compulsions (Worbe et al.,  ), OCD symptoms are frequently observed in patients with Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome. Considerations about their frequent comorbidity suggest that the co-occurrence of the two syndromes may in fact represent a specific clinical entity, the recently defined Obsessive-Compulsive Tic Disorder (OCTD; see Dell'Osso et al.,  ): this may comprise the \u201cmalfunctioning\u201d of the neural systems associated with the   whether   component of intentionality, explaining the difficulty of these patients to inhibit their compulsive\/ticking behaviors. \n\n\n### The functional neural correlates of intentional action and of action in general \n  \nThe issue of whether the anatomy of intentional action, and its subcomponents, involves brain regions generally responsible for action was assessed by the co-activation maps analyses. This analysis confirmed the segregation of the clusters along the medial wall and the additional regions seen for the   www   components by our hierarchical clustering analysis. It also confirmed by far and large the extension of component specific regions outside the medial wall of the frontal\/limbic lobe. \n\nA composition analysis of the paradigms that contributed to each of the three clusters of the medial wall of the frontal\/limbic lobe  revealed, as one could expect, first and foremost the extreme heterogeneity of the paradigms that were retrieved with the only constraint of the key-words \u201caction\u201d and \u201cactivation\u201d and \u201cnormal subjects\u201d (see the Supplementary Table  ). Having identified the relative proportion of go\/no-go paradigms behind each cluster, the   what   and the   whether   ones proved to have a significant larger proportion of such paradigms. Although some aspects of these findings are open to discussion, it is a matter of little surprise to observe that the   whether   component of intentionality maps into a cluster that contains a fair proportion of go\/no-go paradigms in a general database of experiments on action. \n\nHowever, the analysis of the paradigms that contributed the raw data for co-activation maps were far from being associated with intentional action experiments only. In fact, at the time of this writing (February 2017), as strange as it might seem , the BrainMap.org database did not contain the 15 studies that were submitted to our hierarchical clustering analysis on the studies on intention. This fortuitous feature was instrumental to our analyses as we were guaranteed that the hierarchical clustering and the co-activation maps analyses were independent, adding validity to our inferences. \n\nIn returning to the crucial matter of our contention here, the fact that the medial wall seeds, on which the co-activation maps analyses were based, segregate in an identical manner to what is revealed by the hierarchical clustering performed on \u201cintentional\u201d experiments, suggests that the specificity of intentionality and its subcomponents cannot be sought   phrenologically   in terms of minute segregated regions exclusively involved in intentionality; on the other hand, the same observation suggests that the   what, when, and whether   segregation for action most likely exists beyond the concept of intentionality. \n\nHowever, it cannot be denied that the presence of an intentional stance during the paradigms meta-analyzed here induced stronger activity in these regions in a component specific manner. This suggests, on the one hand, that intentionality is expressed in these   www   action regions at some microscopical level, perhaps thanks to the boosting effect of some ascending modulatory attentional pathways for tasks in which subjects have to decide how and whether to act by themselves, rather than in reaction to a conditional stimulus. Another possibility is that the relative weights of the connections between the regions involved in the different aspects of intentionality change during intentional action, something that needs to be explored with effective connectivity techniques and that goes beyond the potentials of meta-analyses based on data generated by univariate analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion and future directions \n  \nAfter this meta-analytic review, it is clear that further studies are needed to assess the functional anatomical foundations of the   www-model   of intentionality, in order to overcome the methodological limitations of previous attempts. In particular, we are much in need of novel fMRI experiments in which the sub-components of intentionality, postulated by the above mentioned neurocognitive models, are assessed with an uniform procedure in the same group of subjects. The advantages of a uniform procedure are obvious: significant differences between the intentional tasks in the different conditions should not be confounded by factors (e.g., different populations; different tasks; different scanning protocols) that may hamper the possibility of firm assignations of specific functional anatomical patterns to subcomponents of intentionality. Another unexplored issue is the characterization of intentional actions in conditions in which content, timing and the very decision on whether to act or not are explicitly and jointly manipulated. Furthermore, it remains to be discovered how general-purpose action brain regions become more active when intentionality is operating. This will clearly require analytical approaches that go beyond univariate analyses of the fMRI data. Clearly, one such ambitious model should have some predictive value for pathologies in which a disorder of intentionality and its specific components is expected. Brass and Haggard ( ) speculated about candidate pathologies that may entail a specific disorder of intentionality (e.g., the   when   component in Parkinson's disease). These specific associations also remain to be demonstrated convincingly. However, in spite of all these unsolved issues, we believe that the available literature contains sufficient evidence to think that the   www-model   of intentionality might be a useful starting framework for future investigations. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLZ, SS, and EP reviewed the data for the meta-analyses, performed the analyses, and drafted the manuscript. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5434171,"text_md5":"41cf33da1082bee6fdc1677eff266c88","field_positions":{"authors":[0,57],"journal":[58,76],"publication_year":[78,82],"title":[93,189],"keywords":[203,259],"abstract":[272,2656],"body":[2665,36591]},"batch":3,"pmid":28567010,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2017.00238","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5434171","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5434171"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5434171\">5434171<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5434171  The What, the When, and the Whether of Intentional Action in the Brain: A Meta-Analytical Review"}

Although the medial prefrontal cortex has commonly been associated with choices, there is no consensus on the wider network that underlies diverse intentional decisions and behaviours. Our systematic literature search identified 35 fMRI\/PET experiments using various free-choice paradigms, with appropriate control conditions using external instructions. An Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) meta-analysis showed that, compared with external instructions, intentional decisions consistently activate the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the left insula and the inferior parietal lobule. We then categorized the studies into four different types according to their experimental designs: reactive motor intention, perceptual intention, inhibitory intention, and cognitive intention. We conducted conjunction and contrast meta-analyses to identify consistent and selective spatial convergence of brain activation within each specific category of intentional decision. Finally, we used meta-analytic decoding to probe cognitive processes underlying free choices. Our findings suggest that the neurocognitive process underlying intentional decision incorporates anatomically separated components subserving distinct cognitive and computational roles. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTo fulfil our goals or desires, we constantly interact with the external environment through our voluntary behaviour. In contrast to reflexes that are beyond volition (e.g., a knee-jerk reflex), voluntary behaviours are characterised by choice ( ). Volition characterises the intentional choice or decision between multiple options, where the choice is not sufficiently explained by differences in expected or explicit rewards. The concept of intentional decision refers to this fundamental ability of human cognition: acting voluntarily based on internal or endogenous intentions ( ). \n\nThe role of intention in decision-making occupies a broad spectrum. At one extreme lies externally guided perceptual decision such as stopping at a red traffic light, for which the involvement of internal intention is low because learned rules can dictate a correct choice (even if one can voluntarily break such rules). At the other extreme lies improvisational behaviour in music, painting or dance, which can be strongly determined by moment-to-moment intention. In between lies the common scenario of intentional decision-making, where the external environment constrains only which options are available while internal intentions dictate which of those options to choose. The ability to choose actions, cognitive strategies and behaviours in this way plays a key role throughout the life span and is essential to our understanding of human cognition. In child development from birth to 12 months, actions such as grasping and its coordination with vision gradually emerge from simple reflexes ( ;  ;  ). In patients with neurodegenerative disorders, the inability to engage appropriate intentional behaviour can manifest as apathy ( ), impulsivity ( ) and perseveration ( ). In addition, intentional behaviour is a foundation of social interactions via cooperation and collaboration ( ). \n\nIntentional actions have been characterised by three components in the   what  -  when  -  whether   (WWW) model: (1)   what   action to perform, (2)   when   to perform it, and (3)   whether   to perform the chosen act ( ). The WWW model is based on evidence from two interlinked lines of research. First, the   when   component has been investigated by examining neural signatures immediately prior to intentional actions. Libet's intentional action paradigm is a classic example of this type ( ;  ), which has been used to localize electrophysiological and BOLD activity in the medial-frontal cortex preceding the conscious awareness of subsequent voluntary actions ( ;  ) (but see  ;   for critical evaluations). Second, research on the   what   and   whether   components, the focus of the current study, commonly use variants of the \u201cfree-choice\u201d paradigm to determine the neurocognitive mechanisms of voluntary decision processes. In the literature, several terms have been used to refer to the free-choice paradigm, such as \u201cvoluntary selection\u201d ( ), \u201cwilled action\u201d ( ), \u201cinternal selection\u201d ( ), \u201cself-initiated\u201d ( ), and \u201cchosen actions\u201d ( ). The current study uses these terms interchangeably. \n\nIn a typical free-choice paradigm, participants make a voluntary choice from multiple alternatives on each trial. The available alternatives can either be similar to each other (e.g., responding with different fingers,  ) or distinct (e.g., to choose voluntarily between stopping and acting in the adapted Go\/NoGo task,  ). Importantly, participants are made aware that all available options are homogeneous in terms of their objective outcomes, and the tasks do not introduce or manipulate rewards of costs according to the choices made. In other words, the task is not to identify a correct response. Rather participants can choose any of the available options. The alternate options are equally appropriate, and one's decision must come from intention. The intention could be influenced by endogenous factors, including subtly differential effort, preferences ( ), habits ( ), incorrectly inferred arbitrary rules for the task, and recent actions ( ;  ). \n\nIn recent years, there has been a substantial number of brain imaging studies adopting free-choice paradigms, enabling a well-powered meta-analysis. The current study focused on the hemodynamic and metabolic contrasts of intentional choice vs. specified response, which is the most widely reported task-related effect across free-choice studies. Here, specified responses serve as a control condition, in which participants need to make specific responses determined by the experimenter, rather than choose voluntarily from the same set of options in the free-choice condition. Therefore, the contrast between the two conditions offers an imaging marker of brain activation associated with intentional behaviour, controlling for the common effects of stimulus encoding and response initiation. \n\nThe objectives of this study were three-fold. First, to identify brain regions consistently activated by intentional decision, we performed a systematic search of BOLD-fMRI or PET studies of intentional decision and conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Increased BOLD-fMRI and PET responses during intentional choices are commonly reported in a frontoparietal network centred on the medial frontal cortex ( ). However, some studies also observed activations external to this network during intentional behaviour, in particular in the insula ( ;  ;  ) and the inferior frontal gyrus ( ). Because results from a coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis are pooled from a large number of participants in multiple studies, they usually have higher statistical power than a single experimental study ( ). Using ALE analyses, we aim to test whether there are significant clusters of foci associated with intentional decision across a wide range of free-choice paradigms, and whether these clusters extend beyond the commonly reported medial prefrontal cortex. \n\nSecond, we conducted further contrast and conjunction meta-analyses, assessing the differential and common convergence of brain activations reported by studies investigating different types of intentional behaviour. As highlighted above, the nature of options in a free-choice paradigm can vary significantly between studies and hence involve different cognitive processes. We reviewed all studies to date that met our predefined inclusion criteria (see   Study selection and inclusion criteria  ). Based on the experimental design and implementational details of individual studies, we proposed four categories of the free-choice paradigm ( , see   Paradigm-specific meta-analysis   for the definition of each paradigm): reactional intention (RI), perceptual intention (PI), inhibitory intention (II) and cognitive intention (CI). We hypothesize significant clusters of foci associated with each category of free-choice paradigms. Using ALE contrast analysis, we further tested the hypothesis that some brain regions are more likely to be activated in one free-choice paradigm over another.   \nSchematics and examples of four categories of free-choice studies. (  A  ) In the reactive intention (RI) paradigm, task cues directly indicate available actions. For example, in  , the cue for intentional choice was four black dots, indicating that participants can respond with any one of their four fingers. The cue for a specified response was a black dot over a specific finger, indicating that participants should only respond with that finger. (  B  ) In the perceptual intention (PI) paradigm, task cues contain perceptually similar options that associated with different options. For example, in Lau et\u00a0al. (2004), the cue for intentional choice was the cross at the middle of the screen, indicating that participants can choose any of the patterns on the screen. The cue for a specified response was a specific pattern at the centre of the screen, indicating that participants should choose the pattern that matches the cue. (  C)   In the inhibitory intention (II) paradigm, one of the options is to abandon or abort an intended action. Hence, participants make voluntary choices between Go and Stop (e.g.,  ). In the corresponding specified response condition, participants are instructed to either execute or inhibit their actions. (  D  ) In the cognitive intention (CI) paradigm, participants choose between different operations that require higher-level cognitive processing. Behavioural responses are dependent on the execution of the chosen cognitive operation. For example, in  , the cues were different for the intentional and specified condition. In the intentional condition, participants chose to add or subtract two numbers and then select the correct answer based on their choice. In the specified condition, participants followed the instruction to perform a specific arithmetic operation. \n  Fig 1   \n\nThird, to undertake an exploratory data-driven analysis, testing whether consistent BOLD-fMRI\/PET patterns of intentional behaviour correspond to specific cognitive processes. We quantified the similarity between the meta-analytical whole-brain activation pattern estimated from free-choice studies and brain activation patterns from 100 specific cognitive topics, extracted from a database of over 11,000 brain imaging studies ( ;  ). This \u201cdecoding\u201d approach raises hypotheses about the putative cognitive processes underpinning intentional behaviour, where different cognitive processes are associated with specific networks of the human brain. Finally, we reviewed results from these meta-analyses in the context of current cognitive models of intentional choice. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study selection and inclusion criteria \n  \nWe defined intentional choices as experimental paradigms involving self-initiated, voluntary selections of an action from two or more alternatives ( ). The experimental procedure would need to instruct participants that there are no correct or incorrect choices, and they are free to choose any option among available alternatives. This type of intentional choices differs from conventional goal-directed or externally cued behaviour, in which a correct or instructed response could be defined or identified. We focused on existing studies investigating the   \u201cwhat\u201d   (which action to choose) or \u201c  whether  \u201d (whether or not to execute an action) component of intentional behaviour ( ). Studies focusing on the \u201c  when  \u201d component (i.e., when to execute, as in  ) is not considered here, but is briefly reviewed in Discussion. \n\nWe conducted a systematic literature search in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines ( ) to identify brain imaging studies of intentional choice. The literature search was performed on both PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC) databases, because the two databases may contain different publications. The PubMed database was searched with specified keywords as following: (\"volitional decision\" OR \"volitional choice\" OR \"voluntary decision\" OR \"intended decision\" OR \"intentional decision\" OR \"voluntary choice\" OR \"intended choice\" OR \"intentional choice\" OR \"free decision\" OR \"free choice\" OR \"volitional action\" OR \"voluntary action\" OR \"intended action\" OR \"intentional action\" OR \"free action\" OR \"volitional selection\" OR \"voluntary selection\" OR \"intended selection\" OR \"intentional selection\" OR \"free selection\") AND (\"fMRI\" OR \"functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" OR \"BOLD\" OR \"Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent\" OR \"Positron Emission Tomography\"). For the PMC database, the same keywords were employed in the interrogation and a filter on the search field was set to \u201cBody - Key Terms\u201d to constrain search in a more concrete range. The search results from PubMed and PMC databases were combined with duplicated records removed, resulting in 332 publications as of October 2020. \n\nWe then inspected every publication from the literature search. The further inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis were applied as follows:   \nStudies reported first hand data that comes from experiments rather than reviews or meta-analysis. 291 of the 332 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies included results from healthy adult participants. 239 of the remaining 291 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies employed an intentional choice paradigm(s) and reported a fMRI\/PET contrast of intentional choice vs. specified response conditions. Here, in the specified response condition, participants responded with the same set of possible actions as in the intentional choice condition, but the identity of which action to respond (or whether to respond) was determined by the experimenter. 37 of the remaining 239 publications met this criterion. \n  \nStudies reported whole-brain analysis with MNI or Talairach coordinates of the cluster peaks. 34 of the remaining 37 publications met this criterion. \n  \nIf more than one appropriate contrast with the same group of subjects were reported in a single study, only one contrast was included in the meta-analysis. \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of intentional decision \n  \nAfter the screening, 34 fMRI\/PET studies met the selection criteria, which included 35 independent experiments for meta-analysis. 25 studies recruited only right-handed participants, 1 study recruited thirteen right-handed and one left-handed participants, and the other 8 studies did not specify participants\u2019 handedness. These studies contained a total of 633 participants and reported 329 peak foci of increased fMRI\/PET responses to the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast. Less than 3% foci (9 out of 329) were out of the brain mask in the GingerALE toolbox ( ;  ), which was within the normal range due to spatial smoothing and potential registration errors ( ). Therefore, all foci were included in the study to maximize the usage of the original dataset. For activation foci reported in the Talairach space, we converted them to MNI coordinates using the Lancaster algorithm ( ). \n\nThe coordinates-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was conducted over all the 35 experiments using the Ginger-ALE toolbox ( , version 3.0.2) ( ;  ). This analysis aimed to determine, across independent experiments, significant spatial convergence of fMRI\/PET activation probabilities for the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast, under the null hypothesis that the activation foci are distributed randomly throughout the brain. First, for each experiment, the activation probabilities of all foci reported were modelled as 3D Gaussian probability distributions with their full-width half-maximum (FWHM) estimated from the between-subject variance of the experiment ( ). Second, an ALE activation map was then calculated by combining all experimental-level activation maps, yielding a voxel-wise ALE score to quantify the convergence of results across experiments at each voxel location. Third, an analytical approach was used to determine the null distribution of voxel-wise ALE scores. A non-parametric   p  -value map of ALE scores was then generated under the null distribution ( ). Finally, the   p  -value map was thresholded at   p\u00a0<  \u00a00.001 and corrected for multiple comparisons across voxels using a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction from 5,000 permutations (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, cluster-corrected). \n\n\n### Paradigm-specific meta-analysis \n  \nWe categorized the 35 experiments into four intentional choice paradigms based on their experimental designs and procedures ( ). The first category is referred to as reactional intention (RI), in which participants voluntarily choose cues that associate to specific motor actions. We considered this category as the simplest form of intentional choice because a cue in the RI paradigm is directly linked to a target action. The second category is referred to as perceptual intention (PI), in which participants voluntarily choose between perceptually distinct targets (e.g., icons or pictures). Compared to the RI paradigm, the PI paradigm involves an additional matching process: an option is associated with a perceptual target, and the target is then associated with a specific motor action. The third category is referred to as inhibitory intention (II), in which at least one option is not to act (i.e., withholding responses). A cue in the II paradigm is associated directly with a specific action or the inhibition of action. The final category is referred to as cognitive intention (CI). The free choice condition in the CI paradigm requires the participants to choose between options that involve higher-order cognitive processes such as doing arithmetic or generating words. \n\nFor studies employed each of the four paradigm categories, we performed the same ALE meta-analysis to identify the spatial convergence of fMRI\/PET activation for the intentional choice vs. specified response contrast. The same procedure to correct for multiple comparisons was applied as in the meta-analysis across all studies (see  ). \n\nBased on the thresholded ALE maps from individual paradigms, we then conducted further conjunction and contrast meta-analyses between the RI and PI paradigms as well as the RI and II paradigms, using the \u201ccontrast study\u201d function implemented in GingerALE. This allowed us to localize voxels commonly (i.e., conjunction) or differentially (i.e., contrast) activated across intentional choice paradigms. The conjunction images were created using the voxel-wise minimum value of the input ALE images. To correct for study sizes ( ), the contrast analyses were conducted through permutation tests. First, the ALE differences image was created by directly subtracting one input image from the other. Second, the simulated data was created by pooling the foci datasets and randomly dividing them into two new groups with the same size as the original groups. Third, a new ALE difference image was created by directly subtracting of the two new datasets and then compared to the true data. Fourth, with multiple permutations, a voxel-wise   p-  value image was created to illustrate where the true data sit on the distribution of the ALE differences in each voxel. A lenient threshold (cluster threshold 200 mm , uncorrected voxel-level threshold   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, permutation tests with 5,000 iterations) was applied to the contrast analyses between paradigm categories to avoid type II errors ( ). No conjunction or contrast meta-analysis was conducted on experiments using the CI paradigm due to the limited number of studies available in that category. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic decoding of intentional decision \n  \nALE activation maps indicate brain regions of consistent fMRI\/PET activations between studies. We then used NeuroSynth ( ) to perform a \u201creverse-inference\u201d type of meta-analysis. That is, we meta-analytically decoded which cognitive functions or processes are likely to give rise to the consistent brain activations observed in ALE activation maps. As highlighted previously, one should interpret results from reverse inference with caution ( ). Most functional brain imaging results are correlational. The involvement of a brain region in a certain cognitive function does not directly support the notion that the region is exclusively associated with the cognitive process. Nevertheless, meta-analytic decoding against large, unbiased imaging databases did provide useful information about the engagement of cognitive processes ( ). In the current study, we consider our meta-analytic decoding analysis to be contributory rather than confirmatory, which offers insights for future studies of intentional decision. \n\nWe considered a set of 100 cognitive topics that were previously generated from over 11,000 brain imaging studies. The 100 topics were extracted by fitting a generative statistical model of sematic topics ( ) to the abstracts of over 11,000 brain imaging articles in the NeuroSynth database (for details see  ). We ignored the topics related to general methods (e.g., fMRI) and focus only on the topics related to cognitive processes. For each cognitive topic, a whole-brain association-test map (also referred to as the reverse inference map) was generated from all the articles in the database. The value at each voxel of the association-test map quantifies the extent to which studies loaded highly on the current topic reported more consistent activation at this location than all the other studies ( ). \n\nWe estimated the similarity between each unthresholded ALE activation   p-  value map with respect to the association-test maps of the 100 cognitive topics by calculating their Pearson correlations across voxels. The resulting correlation coefficients were rank ordered to identify the cognitive topics that are most likely to be present during intentional decision and its specific paradigms. \n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nAll data used in this meta-analysis study were obtained from original publications. We have made the aggregated data open access ( ), which include the imaging data entered meta-analyses and unthresholded statistical maps from meta-analyses. \n\n\n### Ethics statement \n  \nThis study did not include data from new participants. In all meta-analyses, we only considered studies that had obtained informed consent from human participants. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of intentional decision \n  \nThirty-four brain imaging studies were identified from our symmetric literature search, which included 35 independent experiments of intentional decision. The number of participants, experimental paradigms and other details were summarized in  .   \nList of intentional decision studies that meet the inclusion criteria. \n  Table 1       \n\nThere is no correct answer among available options in free choice paradigms. Nevertheless, behavioural performance can be evaluated in other ways, for example using response time (normally referred to the latency between task cues and responses) and the proportion of valid response. The latter applies to experiments (e.g.,  ) in which participants make a free choice from   M   available options when there is a total of   N   options (where   M  <  N  ). If an unavailable option was chosen, the response is deemed to be invalid. Here, the proportion of valid response is akin to the conventional decision accuracy. Supplementary Table 3 summarized the behavioural responses from studies included in the meta-analysis. The general pattern of the high proportion of valid response and fast RT suggest that participants did actively perform tasks in those studies. \n\nAcross all the 35 experiments, a Ginger-ALE meta-analysis on the contrast between free choice and specified response yielded greater BOLD-fMRI\/PET activations related to intentional behaviour in a frontoparietal network ( ). The analysis identified 19 peaks in 7 clusters, including bilateral pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right premotor area and left anterior insula cortex (AIC) ( ,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01, cluster-level corrected). At a more lenient threshold (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.01 uncorrected), there was a cluster in the right AIC (peak coordinate:   X  \u00a0=\u00a034,   Y  \u00a0=\u00a024,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a08).   \nALE meta-analyses of all free-choice studies showing significant clusters related to intentional decision (  p  <0.01, cluster-level FWE corrected from 5,000 permutations).

Voxels in this cluster mainly intersect with one of the five ROIs in the HCP-MMP atlas ( ): a24pr (ventral ACC), p24 (ventral ACC), d32 (dorsal ACC), 8BM (pre-SMA) and SCEF (supplementary and cingulate eye fields) ( C). The posterior boundary of the medial prefrontal cluster falls in the SCEF (Brodmann area 6). \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of contrasts between intentional decision paradigms \n  \nTo investigate whether different types of intentional behaviour relate to selective brain responses, we assigned intentional decision studies into four categories ( ), depending on their characteristics of experimental paradigms: reactive intention (RI), perceptual intention (PI), inhibitory intention (II) and other higher cognitive intention (CI). \n\nFree choices in the RI paradigm were consistently associated with greater activations in 6 clusters with 13 peak foci, including bilateral pre-SMA and ACC, bilateral IPL, bilateral prefrontal area and right premotor area. For the PI paradigm, the analysis revealed 4 clusters with 8 peak foci located in bilateral prefrontal area, left ACC and pre-SMA cluster. For the II paradigm, there were 7 clusters with 14 peak foci located in bilateral IPL, right premotor area, bilateral prefrontal area and right PreSMA. No significant results were observed in the meta-analysis of the CI paradigm, possibly due to the limited number of studies in that category. \n\nTo quantify the differential and common convergence of brain activation in studies of different types of intentional behaviour, we conducted further contrast and conjunction meta-analyses, comparing both the PI paradigm (involving perceptual processing) and the II paradigm (involving inhibitory processing) with the most elementary paradigm (i.e., the RI paradigm). The contrast meta-analysis showed that the bilateral IPL is more likely to activate in the II than the RI paradigm ( B,  ). No significant difference was found between PI and RI paradigm. The conjunction meta-analysis showed that bilateral Pre-SMA\/ACC complex and the left dlPFC are commonly activated in intentional behaviour across studies of PI and RI paradigms, and activations in the right IPL and right PreSMA are commonly observed in both II and RI paradigms ( A,  ).   \nContrast and conjunction meta-analyses (  A  ) ALE conjunction meta-analyses between PI and RI paradigms (top) as well as II and RI paradigms (bottom).

Peak coordinates of clusters were reported in the MNI space (mm). \n  Table 4   \n\n\n### Meta-analytic decoding of intentional decision \n  \nTo probe cognitive processes underlying intentional decision, we assessed the spatial similarity (i.e., Pearson correlation across voxels) between the ALE activation maps from our meta-analysis and 100 association-test maps. Each of the association-test maps represents brain response selective to one of 100 psychological topics, generated from meta-analyses of >11,000 independent studies ( ). Therefore, a high correlation coefficient to an association-test map would imply the potential involvement of the corresponding cognitive process. The primary interest here is the relative ranking of the topics based on the similarity of their association-test maps to our results, not to perform null hypothesis significance testing on each correlation. \n\nThis exploratory analysis showed that the frontoparietal network identified in the meta-analysis of intentional decision across all studies ( ) was strongly associated with several psychological topics. The top three are working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.445), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.392) and cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.366) ( , and see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for full results).   \nMeta-analytic decoding of intentional decision. Correlation coefficients between different cognitive topics\u2019 association maps and ALE maps of intentional decision were calculated. The correlation values for the top 8 topics were illustrated in a polar plot. Terms used to generate those topic-based association maps were listed in Supplementary Table 1. \n  Fig 4   \n\nWe also applied the same decoding procedure to paradigm-specific ALE-activation maps. The RI paradigm was associated with the topic of working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.393), conflict (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.350) and task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.348). PI paradigm was associated with the topic of working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.450), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.325) and cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.322). II paradigm was associated with the working memory (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.307), cognitive control (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.271), task rules (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.260) and feedback (  R  \u00a0=\u00a00.227). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur meta-analysis considered the convergence of fMRI\/PET responses reported in intentional decision studies. Across a large variety of free-choice paradigms, when contrasted against the same behavioural response prescribed exogenously ( ), intentional decision is associated with a convergence of BOLD\/PET activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA and caudal ACC), the lateral frontoparietal cortices (DLPFC and IPL) and the anterior insula cortex (AIC). Here, we specifically focused on the free-choice paradigm, in which participants were given the freedom to choose among multiple options, instead of seeking a correct answer as in perceptual or reward based decision-making tasks. Our study further delineates a broad spectrum of free-choice paradigms in the current literature, with category-specific ALE results. \n\nPrevious meta-analysis studies on similar topics have distinct research questions. For example,   examined the overlapping activity between action selection and action inhibition, with the latter referring to the externally-instructed go\/no-go task, different from intentional inhibition paradigms considered here. Using clustering analysis,   reported regions separately associated with the   what, when   and   whether   components of intentional action. Our specific focus on free choice paradigms resulted in more studies from the literature search than previous meta-analyses: 35 experiments vs. 17 studies on intentional decision in   and 15 studies in  . With the increased power, the current study confirmed that the cortical activation pattern reported here is generalizable across a rich set of free-choice paradigms. It further confirmed the involvement of the AIC that was not consistently observed in previous studies. \n\nThe meta-analytic decoding analysis suggested that the spatial convergence of fMRI\/PET responses in intentional decision is similar to previous experiments investigating certain cognitive terms, e.g., cognitive control, working memory and conflict. This is an exploratory analysis, and the decoding results were not tested against a null hypothesis to confirm the involvement of a particular cognitive function. Rather than interpreting cognitive functions of a single brain region, the meta-analytic decoding analysis quantitatively related whole-brain ALE results of intentional decision to previous imaging results. The overlapping brain maps between intentional decision and other cognitive paradigms, as suggested by our exploratory analyses, may lead to the development of new hypotheses and predictions. For example, one may test the interplay between intentional choices and working memory, with the expectation that lesion or brain stimulation to a region associated with both processes would affect behaviour. Therefore, our results provide insight into the cognitive roles of brain networks that mediate intentional behaviour in humans, which we discuss below together with their potential computational processes. \n\n### Functional localization of intentional decision in the brain \n  \nThe brain areas involved in intentional decision overlap closely with the multiple demand network ( ;  ), a \u201ctask-positive\u201d co-activation pattern associated with diverse cognitive demands ( ;  ). A closer inspection of the literature indicates that subcomponents of this network may serve different cognitive roles during intentional decisions, which is also supported by our meta-analytic decoding results ( ). \n\nA large body of evidence indicates the putative role of ACC in conflict monitoring ( ). Conflicts in information processing arise from the presence of response competition. Greater ACC activation is consistently observed when (1) one or more prepotent responses need to be overridden, such as in the Stroop task ( ;  ) and the flanker task ( ;  ), or (2) a voluntary choice is needed among multiple underdetermined options, like in all the free-choice paradigms discussed here. Although the existing literature of conflict monitoring is largely focused on the ACC, the adjacent pre-SMA is also sensitive to the presence of conflict, in particular the conflict in response selection, as lesions in this region lead to deficits in exerting voluntary control over immediate actions ( ). According to the conflict monitoring theory, as multiple options become available in the free-choice paradigm, increased ACC and pre-SMA activities may encode conflicts as an index of the need for greater cognitive demand, which in turn trigger voluntary choices to reduce or resolve the conflict ( ;  ). A direct prediction of this proposition is that the activity in the medial prefrontal cortex should increase proportionally, at least to some extent, to the number of available options in the free-choice paradigm, which has been validated in previous studies (e.g.,  ). \n\nACC, more specifically the dorsal ACC, is also involved in a diverse set of cognitive functions beyond conflict monitoring, including error detection and response selection ( ;  ). Using a modified flanker task with free choices,   showed a disassociation between ACC and pre-SMA in conflict monitoring and response selection, respectively. However, there is a lack of studies to attribute a definitive functional role to the dorsal ACC across multiple free-choice paradigms. \n\nBeyond the medial prefrontal cortex, the frontoparietal network on the lateral brain surface has a distinct functional connectivity pattern relating to cognitive control ( ) and executive task performance ( ). Two functions of this network are essential to intentional behaviour. First, intentional decisions in the free-choice paradigm are, by definition, rendered endogenously. Nevertheless, the brain may still establish a \u201ctask set\u201d that incorporates transient and arbitrary rules in addition to relevant exogenous information, such as associations of stimuli and imagined outcomes as well as available options ( ). Both single-unit recording in non-human primates ( ;  ;  ) and brain imaging in humans ( ;  ) have identified neural representations of various task sets in the frontoparietal network. The encoding of a task set can be actively maintained in this network until its execution ( ), thereby facilitating the intentional decision process to unfold in time. Second, intentional behaviour is commonly accompanied by the subjective experience of volitional control ( ), which requires internal models that matches the consequences of the response against its initial intention ( ). It has been proposed that the parietal cortex hosts such internal models ( ), as patients with parietal lesions exhibited altered behavioural and electrophysiological signatures of their intention to act ( ). \n\nOur meta-analysis across all free-choice experiments showed the consistent involvement of the AIC during intentional decision, in spite of the lack of significant insula activity in some studies (e.g.,  ). This supports an earlier account that the AIC is a key component of the integrated brain network involved in intentional behaviour ( ). Anatomically, the AIC connects directly to the ACC ( ;  ). Functionally, robust coactivation in the AIC and ACC was observed across multiple cognitive domains ( ) as well as in resting-state ( ), and both regions are a part of the salience network ( ). It may therefore be tempting to ascribe the AIC activity to conflict processing during intentional decision, similar to that of ACC. An alternative proposal originated from the AIC's unique function in signalling introspective awareness ( ) or subjective salience ( ) of cognitive ( ), homeostatic ( ;  ) and emotional ( ) information, which is not shared with the ACC. According to this theory, AIC activity reflects the affective consequences of intentional decisions. In other words, the AIC may not directly associate with the formation of current intention; instead, it evaluates the outcome of the intentional act with respect to an internal model of one's long term goal (see   for a detailed review). \n\n\n### The which, when and whether components of intentional behaviour \n  \nThe current study does not aim to support or challenge the conceptual Which-When-Weather (WWW) distinctions ( ). Instead, we focused on a common contrast in free-choice paradigms (i.e., choice vs. specified), which emphasizes the presence of an intentional choice among alternatives. Our literature review suggested that papers reporting this contrast examined the BOLD\/PET response to decisions between actions (reactive intention), between perceptual targets (perceptual intention), between act and stop (inhibitory intention) and between more complex cognitive operations (cognitive intention). Main research questions in these paradigms naturally involve the   which   and   whether   components of the WWW model. \n\nThe timing of intentional behaviour, the   when   component of the WWW model, is initially and commonly investigated using electrophysiology ( ), focusing on the time course of neural activity leading to an intentional act. This does not preclude the use of fMRI\/PET to study the contrast of responses at intentional timing vs. responses at specified timing. \n\nImaging studies on the   when   component employed diverse designs and their primary contrasts includes: (1) subjective awareness of the timing of intention as in Libet's task ( ) vs. subjective awareness of the timing of an action ( ); (2) free to act at any time vs. act after a response cue ( ); (3) free to act at one of several time points vs. act at a specified time point ( ;  ). As such, existing studies considering the   when   component cannot be readily formalized as a choice between one overt option versus another, different from other free-choice paradigms considered here. Also, previous meta-analysis has specifically summarized studies of the   when   component ( ). Hence, we did not include those papers in the current meta-analysis. We outlined below how the   when   component can be incorporated into a computational model of intentional decision. \n\n\n### Computational processes of intentional decision \n  \nWith the identification of the consistent brain network for intentional decision-making, a new question arises: what is the computational process underlying intentional decision? Converging findings from behavioural modelling ( ), single-unit recoding ( ;  ;  ) and imaging ( ;  ;  ) experiments suggest that, when making choices based on external stimuli, an accumulation-to-threshold mechanism governs the decision-making process ( ;  ;  ): the evidence supporting one or multiple options are accumulated over time, and a choice is made when the accumulated evidence reached a decision threshold. For perceptual decisions with noisy sensory stimuli, this accumulation process reduces the momentary noise in information-processing and in turn results in more accurate decisions ( ,  ;  ). \n\nFor intentional decisions, it has been shown that a computational model implementing the accumulation-to-threshold mechanism can well describe the behavioural performance (i.e., response time distributions and choice probabilities) of both RI ( ) and PI paradigms ( ). Furthermore, the accumulated evidence predicted by the model is associated with the BOLD response in the ACC and pre-SMA on a trial-by-trial basis ( ). These results raise an intriguing possibility that, during intentional decision, the medial prefrontal cortex implements the accumulation-to-threshold process to integrate over time the transitory intention of choosing different options, until the accumulated intention for one choice reaches a decision threshold. \n\nThis hypothesis is supported by several electrophysiological studies, which characterised the accumulation process during intentional behaviour at a high temporal resolution. First, in Libet's paradigm of voluntary action, the readiness potential measured by scalp EEG precedes participants\u2019 conscious awareness of their voluntary intention (i.e., the \u201curge to move\u201d,  ). An accumulator model can be fit to the time latency of participants\u2019 urge to move, and the activity of the accumulator qualitatively reproduces the time course of the readiness potential prior to conscious intention ( ). Second, in a free-choice version of Libet's paradigm, when participants made intentional decisions between responding with their left or right hands, neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex build up several hundred milliseconds before the onset of conscious intention ( ). Further, medial prefrontal neurons contralateral to the acting hand exhibited larger activity than ipsilateral neurons ( ). Therefore, the medial prefrontal cortex may host accumulated intentions of multiple responses as well as their mutual competition, from which voluntary acts are rendered via the accumulation-to-threshold mechanism. \n\nThe putative role of the medial prefrontal cortex in intention accumulation is not inconsistent with this region's function of conflict monitoring discussed above, because more free options would be associated with larger accumulated intention across alternatives as well as higher conflict. In this regard, intention accumulation can be interpreted as a computational implementation of detecting and resolving conflicts among underdetermined options. Therefore, we consider the accumulation process as a parsimonious computational framework for intentional behaviour outlined by the conceptual   what  -  when  -  whether   model ( ), because accumulator models can explain quantitatively both \u201c  what\u201d   (i.e., choice probabilities) and   \u201cwhen\u201d   (i.e., response time distributions) components. Interestingly, accumulator models can also be fitted to behavioural performance in externally-triggered stopping tasks ( ;  ). Future research should investigate if accumulator models can incorporate the \u201c  whether  \u201d component, or voluntary stopping in the II paradigm. \n\n\n### Paradigm-specific activations during intentional decision \n  \nBy categorizing free-choice studies into different types according to their experimental design, we identified brain regions associated with consistent and specific convergence between studies on sub-categories of intentional decision ( ). The conjunction meta-analysis of the RI and PI paradigms showed that the pre-SMA\/ACC and DLPFC are associated with both types of intentional decision. This is expected, as the RI and PI paradigms have a similar task structure, involving rapid voluntary choices among multiple action plans ( ). However, the contrast analysis did not reveal any difference between the two paradigms. \n\nThe II paradigm includes a unique option of not to act or intentionally inhibit one's action ( C). The conjunction meta-analysis of the II and RI paradigms showed that the right supramarginal gyrus in the IPL and right pre-SMA was associated with both types of intentional decisions, and the contrast meta-analysis showed that the bilateral supramarginal gyrus was more likely to be activated in the II than that in the RI paradigm. In both RI and II paradigms, participants need to reprogram their response model according to available options in each trial, which fits the critical role of the supramarginal gyrus in action reprogramming ( ). The same region is also sensitive to the content of action plans and their similarity ( ). It could be argued that options in the II paradigm are more dissimilar (i.e., acting versus stopping) than that in the RI paradigm (i.e., multiple but similar actions), which leads to the additional recruitment of the supramarginal gyrus in the II paradigm. \n\nIt is worth noting that the results of conjunction and contrast meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution, because of the limited number of studies available in each category. Our discussion on the functional roles involved in individual paradigms was based on previous evidence and hence was circumstantial. Furthermore, one potential confound of the contrast meta-analysis is that different paradigm categories may vary in their task difficulty, and hence the contrast between categories may not directly support the involvement of distinct cognitive processes. This issue can be examined in future studies that explicitly manipulate both task difficulty and intentional decision paradigms. \n\n\n### Future directions and conclusion \n  \nThis analysis leaves open some issues for future research on human intentional decision-making. First, our systematic review identified only five studies in the CI category: three studies included options with attention shifts or saccades ( ;  ;  ), one with verbal responses ( ) and the other one with arithmetic rules ( ). The small number of CI studies did not yield any significant result in the paradigm-specific meta-analysis, but that may reflect type II error. We recommend future research to explore different types of CI studies and examine the robustness and consistency of existing results across a range of distinct cognitive processes. \n\nSecond, our meta-analysis of the II paradigm did not show conventional regions involved in inhibitory control ( ). We propose that this is due to the fact that our analysis used the contrast of intentional choice vs. specified response, with the former including intentional stopping and the latter including externally triggered stopping - this contrast may therefore not detect differential response inhibition. Indeed, the BOLD response in the AIC was higher during intentional stopping than intentional action execution ( ), while the inferior frontal gyrus is consistently observed during instructed stopping ( ). To examine how the brain switches effectively between intentional and instructed stopping in the II paradigm, one need to examine the effective connectivity between these two regions and the medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in both types of stopping ( ;  ). \n\nThird, the current imaging literature on intentional behaviour indicates that the main focus is to localize associated brain regions or their underlying computational processes. Less is known about why a participant would intentionally choose one option over others in a trial. The answer to this question is important because the sequence of intentional decisions over trials are not completely random ( ) but dependent on executive control of working memory ( ), the context of a given choice in a sequence ( ), and other sources of response biases ( ). We suggest that the free-choice paradigm provides an ideal testbed for future research to investigate the interplay between the intentional process during a single trial and modulatory effects that operate at a longer time span. \n\nFourth, brain regions unlikely act in isolation during intentional decision, and the functional connectivity between regions cannot be ignored. Among all studies included in the current meta-analysis, only two examined functional connectivity ( ;  ), insufficient to draw inferences on a meta-analytic level. Using structural equation modelling,   showed that the prefrontal cortex has greater coupling with the motor cortex during free choices of actions, and with the visual cortex during free choices of colours. Similarly, using psychophysiological interaction analyses,   reported greater connectivity between the parietal cortex and the visual cortex during free choice of coloured targets. These results imply task-dependent changes in the effective connectivity between brain regions during free choices. \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis identifies a brain network consistently activated when humans have the freedom to make intentional choices among multiple options. Some components of this network are recruited specifically in subcategories of the free-choice paradigm. Multiple cognitive and computational processes are involved in intentional decision, which collectively serve essential roles in shaping and maintaining volitional control. \n\n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Ruoguang Si:   Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing \u2013 review & editing.
